I am in same situation and the simple answer to this is \"It's time for a new adventure, either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.\"Further Details of my past couple of weeks- I'm an 8-year experienced Data Engineer who has been working at the same organization for the past three years. I was quite satisfied until I was asked to conduct technical interviews for few of new future team members with 4-5 years of experience each. The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.Last week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience. However, both candidates turned down the offers, requesting better compensation. The salary they rejected was approximately $11,750 more than what I currently earn annually. I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?This revelation devastated me. When I discussed it with friends, everyone told me there's no point trying to negotiate a raise with my current organization. They advised me to either start interviewing elsewhere and leave, or only discuss a raise when I have a competing offer in hand. According to them, there's no easier alternative - either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.Most companies show no empathy toward their employees and view them merely as workhorses. They constantly test boundaries, seeking maximum returns for minimum investment.",

If you get pushback, point out that your team is always delivering late, so clearly everyone is \\*under\\*-estimating and you are trying to be realistic. 2. If you are not influential on your team, discuss with someone who is and work a plan. Come with some ideas for solutions rather than just complaints and figure out how to present them. e.g. switch to a Kanban-style workflow; keep the backlog groomed and in prioritized order; for tickets with firm deadlines find a way to indicate the deadline so it gets prioritized correctly. Each person works on only one active story at a time until it is in a review stage where they are waiting on approval to merge. Only then do they pick up the next story on the backlog assigned to them.This gives a clarity to bottlenecks, and focus to what is in progress as it is limited at any given time. It forces clear prioritization of the work each person needs to do next: if a new urgent task comes in, it's set appropriately at or near the top of the backlog. Other items naturally shift down.It does require constant grooming & prioritization, and attention to velocity to ensure the lack of sprint deadline does not cause people to slack off. In addition to that, you can start the week off with everyone stating their goal(s) for the week based on what they know right then.

The rules, roles and responsibilities are enforced by the boss, we review and explain why something went wrong and are held accountable for it not happening again. Retro sessions are sometimes general, and sometimes focused on a single process or issue (such as: \"why are we always over capacity\") and the scrum master follow up on those sessions, which usually result in new ways of working some 2-6 weeks laterSpecifically to your issue, the most holy of holy rituals for us is the \"backlog refinement\". No story can make it into a sprint if it's not \"Presented\", \"Refined\" and \"Estimated\". Anyone can refuse a story to progress further if it's unclear. If a dev estimates an unclear story, it's up to him. If a BA presents a story 7 times and it's still not clear... well he's not a BA with us for long...",

So a typical sprint was - I'd get 3-4 tickets (we had 14 day sprint) and ended up completing maybe 2 and another 2-3 which were added during the sprint. It's even worse if you want to do long term planning - we can plan in general (for example building new DWH), but it's impossible to plan timeline. Estimations were mostly ok, but yes, if it's something that involves data exploration and prototyping it can be widely off.The only thing that's left from scrum are daily meetings.

The point of the estimation is to compare tasks to each other, not to understand the day and hour when the task will be completed.

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models. All that said, when it comes to raw ingestion, python notebooks or dlt pipelines are still the way to go. I don’t have any experience with snowflake, so can’t help you there!",

For dbt, you can still have options to lead team on using more software engineering oriented approach ( DRY, unit tests, or maybe how to trigger different dbt jobs)",

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.And yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change. An example of this would be databricks workspaces with exact same naming for database objects for each individual environment and when you deploy to other environments you just ensure the target workspace is where the code is being deployed.

That data can be messy, often unstructured, etc. not easy to work with.How do we actually do it? The DE team works with stakeholders to find all data inputs/sources and identify needs (dashboard, ML, etc.). from there we use an established tech stack like S3 + redshift, or snowflake, iceberg, on and on, to meet those needs. The logic in between data collection and storage (cleanup, semantics, null and duplicate removal) is often custom designed and programmed in house. We use python mainly with HPC and spark",

Since the ask was to just do a review and drop in a few additional data sources you're given far too little time to render it in any acceptable state between the choices already made on the frontend and a legacy framework that doesn't let you do anything out of the box.So you're left with working way too hard to do basic shit like implementing code in a repository and not running production dashboards on a sandbox environment because they thought that engineering really didn't need to be involved earlier on in the process. While yes, conceptually what you've outlined does make sense the reality is that in the majority of organizations data engineering projects are at the whim and mercy of many different people who don't really understand what exactly is involved. It's often a process of trying to figure out the best enough way forward with the time you have. Big companies often grow these systems organically and incrementally, so you're making decisions based on the tooling available now.All that to say that the data modelling and flow is relatively easy. It's navigating the bullshit that's the hard part.",

As far as possible, why not?Are we sacrificing depth for breadth? That's silly, you're not a PhD researcher, you're a data plumber. Just plumb stuff together.Is this expectation more common? You're assigning a huge importance to something one person - likely a non-technical manager - told you, ignoring the fact this person's job is to increase the ROI of hiring you.Is being full-stack really an advantage? I readily accept most new responsibilities, and my career has tremendously benefited from it. You do you, some people just want a clear, stable scope and don't mind not climbing the ladder, or have already done so.I'm skeptical of this whole idea that there are \"growing expectations\" on DEs. Who's expecting? Are these people in the room right now? This is such a one-sided, uncreative way of framing the behavior of interested parties.Management and biz are obliged to wish for everything they can wish for, it's their job. If you could work for 10 people and substitute a huge, costly team, they'd love that. You're supposed to know this is what the incentives in place lead people to daydream about, and don't give it much thought. I'm sure you and most DEs have professional wet dreams of our own, that you know are not in any CEO's best interest and that they're also not supposed to worry about it.The only relevant question is: is there a Nash equilibrium in the DE job market in which most companies have overworked DEs wearing 5 hats at a time? Sounds silly when you say it out loud, doesn't it?",

Then we even added methods that would make the object prune rows that were not present in some related tbl. such was business need. and the surface code was much less verbose than without the oop. easier to read.similar with FP: e.g. you need to applt some transfornation to all column names in a df, write a function that takes another funcion and applies it tobthe names. now you can focus on the transformation logic without worrying about mechanics. you can also unit test both without actually querying for the data frames (make substitute objects that present column names similarly ad df do).edit: sorry for typos. my phone kbd too small for my fat fingers",

And the project has been actively maintained since then with bi-weekly kubeflow calls and even a release 2 months ago. > In May 2025, the Apache Spark Kubernetes Operator launched as an official subproject Kind of. The first formal release just happened, but it was launch as an official subproject in 2023 ([voting thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/wdy7jfhf7m8jy74p6s0npjfd15ym5rxz)) and the first commits happened [a few months later](https://github.com/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator/commit/eddc7e6bef0c270f5d3f3bbe0aef83e77cb2d5ba). > Core maintainers say they might converge APIs eventuallyThey do? One other huge difference this article doesn’t mention is the kubeflow operator is Go (like most operators) and the Apache one is Java. This has the benefit making the Apache one more performant as it’s not shelling out to `spark-submit` and starting a new JVM for every job submission. But the Apache one is missing some good metrics, the Prometheus output doesn’t support tagging, and the SparkApplication resources have to be manually deleted (causing problems at scale if you don’t).",

And regarding Go vs JVM - we try in Big Data Performance Weekly to not be fluff, but also not to be too technical to make big data performance available for everyone :)",

The Kubeflow Spark Operator team [posted some nice benchmarks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/spark-operator/performance/benchmarking/), but the tl;dr is that if you hope to schedule more than 100 jobs per minute, doing so on the Kubeflow operator will be a challenge (though they're working to address it). re: timelines, maybe it's just the wording could be more explicit? I've been testing the Apache operator since late 2024 so it's definitely been launched, but only just published the first formal release. But for the Kubeflow one, you have a header that says `The Kubeflow Era (2018-2023)`. But the operator wasn't donated to Kubeflow until 2023 so that just jumped out at me.",

Then they implement “governance” which means that nobody gets access. Everything has to go through multiple levels of manual approvals and every change can take days or weeks or months of haggling to get actioned. Nobody is monitoring uptime or performance because that’s the vendor’s job - and they aren’t doing it either. Meanwhile it’s expensive for terrible performance and management are constantly staring at it as a cost and trying to get everyone to plan and justify their usage and keep justifying it; which kills both development and later experimentation and just sucks your will to live. Compare to on-premises. Fast. Probably over provisioned and under utilised. But it’s already paid for so you can develop straight away without having to estimate what it’s all going to cost, experiment and have it go wrong without getting a sudden million dollar bill, it’s so much easier to get access or even a couple VMs spun up with admin access, and you can get what you need done. Not every place is like that. But a lot of big ones are.Cloud isn’t what was sold to developers a decade ago. It probably could be, but it isn’t. Companies only get bigger and big companies only get more bureaucratic. What can you do.",

The same could be said for an on-prem company where there isn’t a reliable IT team for managing the servers. I never experienced it but you hear about the meme posts of “unpatched servers” so I doubt those are “reliable and performant”Both on-prem and cloud are susceptible to poor architecture, lack of resources with unrealistic demand for budget, lack of in house knowledge, etc. At the end of the day, the tools themselves matter far less and instead require in-depth understanding of trade offs to know what is the right architecture for different use cases.Lastly, on-prem and cloud both have a place in building Data Platforms. Baffles me why “for on-prem to be good, cloud has to be bad” and vice versa",

This flexibility comes at a price though, even if you are using a low-level unmanaged “serverfull” infrastructure and in the long run having an on-prem setup is cheaper, depending on how mature your team is.Following a product curve, when you reach product maturity you don’t have the need to scale as quick as you think you need.Economic factors also come into play when buying servers today is not the same as buying servers 15 years ago, everything is faster and depending on what you need, cheaper too! There is also the cloud service market saturation too.Don’t know much about Apache NiFi infrastructure needs but I don’t think that going public cloud or on-prem has anything to do with a certain technology/framework, there is so much more at stake here, business-wise.

Anything non - software really.In all of these situations the firm doesn't want or doesn't care to build the expertise you need to manage an on premise data center. Not only do they not have the budget allocated to hire full time permanent IT staff, they usually don't have managers skilled in building or maintaining technology infrastructure teams. They also usually don't have the culture required to do site reliability properly. Imagine at Bank XYZ you ask for a new server. You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left. Or in hardware companies you often have tons of people who can CAD, but a handful who can code. You're only thinking from the perspective of the TECHNOLOGY. It's not about the TECH. It's about the ORGANIZATION. They don't WANT to be TECH companies. They can't recruit developers, they can't retain developers, they can't manage developers, they don't have code quality standards, the limited devs they have are swamped with managing legacy infrastructure that sucks because it was built on top of technical debt and needs to be refreshed.Now, if AWS or Google or Azure come along and say, \"hey you can store 300Gb in object storage for $30/month and we handle patching/security etc.\" do you think anyone in these companies would say no? If you're the only data engineer in company ABC that makes widgets for robots, do you think you'd say \"actually let me configure an on premise data center all by myself, configure all the users, and install Ni-Fi and also let me patch it and renew certs and everything else all by myself, and when my boss yells at me to take shortcuts to please people that don't understand software I'll tell them no\" Do you really think that will fly? Who do you think wins the political battle here? Experienced data engineers aren't thinking about just the tech. They're thinking about the CONTEXT they are working with. Bank operations are about securing lending and loans, personal data, etc., managing risk; IT just facilitates that. So naturally, a cloud vendor flush with cash offering to take some of that risk is a nice feature. Hardware companies want to make quality parts and components at lower prices. If someone says \"hey you can set up your robot telemetry log using AWS IoT offerings..\" what would you do?",

As others have said:\\* adds valuable cred to your resume \\* you may have the opportunity to work with some really great engineers (don't waste that) \\* bigger money early on to put into investments has outsized impact later on due to market growth. You can never catch up by investing later in life to what you will have if you invest now. \\* in-company raises are almost always % based. A 3% raise on $160k vs $120k, and potentially yearly going forward, adds up over time \\* negotiation leverage at your next job for a higher starting salary if you are switching from making, say $165k vs $124k or whatnot. I love the advice someone else gave about taking feedback well and doing your best to learn from it. I think humility, curiosity, and willingness to learn are some of the very best traits you can have. (the humility to graciously admit when you don't know something, or when you are wrong, will pay off in spades over time as you grow)",

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can’t be generated, that would be counted as downtime.Hope this helps. Evaluating the success of a Data Engineering team can be tricky because there is a lot out of our control so whether it is fair or not, we have to play what I call “a lot of defensive” to ensure we are in a good state. But once you get the above 3 down, you can then maybe target something like how fast you can “onboard a new feature”.",

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be. I always thought in my previous career \"well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine\". It never happened. I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience. And it showed.When it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time. I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there. Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, \"Make sure you sort out XYZ\" before I had time to think about it.On top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.My recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own. Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more. Making mistakes and being imperfect is part of learning. I'm a firm believer you don't need a mentor and most people who say you need a mentor are, ironically, mentors.> Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?Mostly surface level. I went to a large one in Europe and my manager joked at the time \"Remember: you are all happily employed\" because it was a running joke that the conferences are just for companies to poach from other companies. I enjoyed the community aspect, learnt a few things. Won some competitions. Getting paid to have fun in a new city is fun.> Any learning paths or courses that helped you understand more than just what works but also why?Honestly? Teach yourself, be willing to learn (as in, be wrong and improve rather than be wrong and convinced you'll be right the next time with exactly the same approach). I'd also say don't chase tools, learn concepts instead as it saves you so much time. Be curious. Be patient - there is no other way to put in 10,000 hours other than putting in 10,000 hours.",

I kind of lied on my resume when I applied for this job (told them I knew Synapse analytics, when I had never even heard of the damn thing). I spent hours on hours teaching myself, watching YT videos on the trains to and back from work lol. Even just seeing how things had been applied beforehand, I learnt a lot and fairly quickly and so, thus far, it has worked out! I especially appreciate the recommendation on learning concepts rather than tools, think I definitely needed that.",

So I think it could be useful where: \\- A: you need to interact with non-technical staff\\- B: You need controls (e.g. security, special data processing rules, high complexity) that warrant implementing via code and having that version controlled-- think GDPR compliance on automating marketing data workflows.\\- C: The data you are working with relies heavily on 3rd party connections (e.g. CRM data from Hubspot).I'm still exploring, so would love to hear what others are thinking, but I think it's one of the best tools out to build quick AI workflows while having some form of version control and staying on a local machine.",

At my org people will create what's supposed to be a POC and then you end up with 8 copy-pasted workflows with slight differences scattered around. This is often because it provides no code connectors with limited flexibility.Another limitation I've found is native logging observability. You can set up error workflows to capture and send errors to a logging service, and also store general execution data in this logging service, but if you have a staff capable of managing this why are we using low code? In my org the people using N8n don't do this. I'll get slack messages and then have to comb through the GUI's very limited execution log screen.People also use it for use cases where it's not needed because they don't know any better (e.g. scheduling a query in your warehouse). You can probably tell I really detest working with it and look forward to not dealing with it at whatever my next job is.",

        "body": "Practical advice: You mention wanting to organise your files but didn't state a clear end goal. You have to first ask yourself: why is it important and/or useful for me to organise this? What benefits do I hope to achieve? Answering those first will give you some guidelines on what needs to be done. Then from there you can pick specific techniques. Though it's important to note that having a 'random stuff' drawer where everything gets put in with no sorting can actually be useful since it cuts the cognitive load of having to sort things. If you haven't found a compelling reason to organise it after 15 years then it's a strong indication that you either don't have a strong reason to do it, or the system you currently use - albeit informal - is workable enough.Ok now I get to put my autistic hat on: As an autistic person I have at times enjoyed organising things 'for their own sake'. Whilst it's been fun and I learned a lot, the end results were never anything \\*that\\* useful. If you're anything like me then just be aware of it. It's fine to spend time and enjoy the process but be cautious about any perceived future benefit.The system I like best for lots of random stuff is the PARA method. You can start by dumping everything into one big 'archive' folder and then either move things out one-by-one into an organised place, or you can move things ad-hoc when you 'touch' them. e.g. if you find yourself needing to use an old python script or look at certain docs, then make sure to move those into the organised structure when you do so.",

I realize every data point that exists reflects most of what the company will have in the future.I’m trying to gain insight out of it. Typically we know how much a project goes over budget, or done 4 months later yet the fine points of why or just data itself with years of specifications etc. I guess that’s the reason for the ask I conceptually understand how it can be organized in the future just not how to untangle this mess the best way",

One thing that really helped me was focusing on real-world problem-solving rather than just theoretical concepts. Try to frame your ML and GenAI projects around actual business challenges – it'll make your skills way more relevant in interviews.For metrics, I'd suggest tracking your progress on coding challenges and your ability to explain complex ideas simply. That last bit is huge in interviews. BTW, I actually created a resource called Experimentation Career by Atticus that dives deep into prepping for data roles. It's helped a bunch of folks land jobs at top tech companies. Might be worth checking out if you want a structured approach. Good luck with your prep – you've got this!",

OP talks about wanting to use Scylla yet also talks about using Django and not having any Postgres experience.OP: using Cassandra or Scylla instead of Postgres is akin to building a full backend MVC framework from scratch instead of using Django. It’s a lot of work, slows down iteration, and is harder to hire for. It also requires a dedicated team to manage properly. You want to put off that decision as long as possible until you absolutely need it otherwise it’s an unnecessary hindrance.",

The first dump is the raw tables where we don't transform any of the JSON object, and instead add metadata columns like Kafka partition, load time, etc. next is a flattened view, where the nested columns are cast to formats or otherwise converted, like obj:customers:first_name::string as first_name. There's other views after that but the point is to store unstructured, then structure on read. You can do stuff like materialised views if you need more performant reads. The benefit of this approach is your ETL doesn't break if the object contents change, and you can always just change the views to reflect evolving schema. It's also very easy to build, and I'm big on simple, managed solutions because engineer time is expensive and niche solutions are a headache to reverse engineer.",

I think you'll be happier in the long run just writing something in Python (or something) that mirrors the logic of your dbt model.Now having given that disclaimer. I suppose you could catch the data passed to the API, write it to a source table for the model, invoke the model with some flavor of \\`dbt run\\` and then gather the data from the output table and send it back. Even if you could inject the source data in a more clean way either via a seed or passing in data like a test would, the output is still going to go to a table which you'd have to retrieve.

This is what this is for, of course it gives back data and won’t generate views in your warehouse.If I was to do this (and I wouldn’t) then I’d think about it as such.0. First up you wouldn’t make this synchronous…so we will need a queue like SQS.1. Rest endpoint in whatever framework deployed with API gateway and lambda2. When the request comes in the lambda writes a request to our SQS queue3. Fargate listens to the SQS event and executes a dbt run where each variable specified gets passed as args into Jinja e.g ```dbt run --vars '{\"key\": \"value\"}```Where the vars here are those that were POSTed to your api endpoint. I wouldn’t use the cli runner but instead the newer added programmatic dbt runner (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/programmatic-invocations)4. When the job is complete it sends some kinda signal of its completion back to SQS.Very alternatively… again terrible experience synchronously0. Same SQS and lambda1. instead make the api create a new Jinja file with all the variables dumped in statically 2. After writing the file it then commits to git.3. You have a GitHub action or whatever listening which deploys the model via CI.Maybe if you can explain more of the problem there might be a better solution…I’m guessing the view is less important and what your users actually care about is the resulting data?Ta",

You create a dag that compiles and run your model and exposes the orchestrator api.But it might be to complex.I would probably create a fast api app and expose its api ( secure it and so on).Calling your api would create a background task that compiles the dbt project and run it. Not using the background task could make the request timeout coz it take some time.And this could be your biggest problem: this would take a lot of time.Is it possible to compile your model in different variations and then use correct version based on the columns in the request? If not the case- try catching the queries so if an user calls with columns a and b. You compile the models and save the compiled model in a map. Colums as a key. When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. And as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue. So it work on one request at a time.Lots of additional questions could be asked but it seems like nice interesting task.",

Most people in the hiring process don’t want to bring in someone who will think out the box (not necessarily smarter) as it hurts their ego if in the event they maybe wrong.

The easiest option would probably be to use an ETL SaaS provider like Fivetran, Estuary or Airbyte to do it for you.If you want to do it yourself with Python, a few questions: - Do you have a read replica of the database so the ETL job doesn't affect your app's performance? - Is this a one-time job or do you want to keep S3 synced with the database always? - Do you have specific latency requirements (data should land in S3 one minute or one day after it's changed in the database)?- Do you have an updated_at column and do you have any index on it (or can you add it)?",

At least, it should not be a bottleneck.And finally, the pandas to_csv should also be quite efficient.It's three very simple steps with less than 100 lines of code in total. There is no reason at all to overcomplicate with all kinds of proprietary libraries and third-party software.",

Permanent table is less likely to pause to update statistics,compared to temp table.BCP out. There are (were) some methods of import/export that performed better then others. How fast does it save to disk?Compress: gzip compressing text gives about 90% compression with minimal CPU overhead.Test an upload to S3 with something on disk. Do you have a bottleneck there?Lastly, depending on transactions/logging, maybe something it’s blocking because it’s trying to get a table lock. Consider copying to a staging table for export.",

Like a Data Analyst would work well with dbt docs, but perhaps someone like in Product, Finance, etc. who are heavy data users but are less data-stack technical may struggle with it.That is where Data Catalogs (which they themselves aren’t perfect) can help but in my experience, I’ve always ended up figuring out the best way to communicate data products to internal/external customers and just write some basic tooling to kick out documentation that can then be updated in Confluence or notion.soI can appreciate the frustration but it is important maintain empathy towards less technical users and finding a way to both manage docs that works for you and your team, dbt docs, and then figure out how to you reduce double work by packaging it up that other teams can engage with it.Documentation is a tricky thing because so many people don’t take the time to do it well. Just like anything in the Data Engineering (or even Software Engineering world), you need to take a step back, evaluate the need, and then figure out how to address that need at different levels:1. Data/Analytic Engineering: lowest level and needs to help onboard new people and ensure you can efficiently catch and triage issues.2. Data Analysts: Your “power data users” typically are served fairly well by the same above docs because they are wanting to understand lineage, data freshness, etc. for when they are building dashboards/reports3. Product/non technical business users: This is where it gets tricky, need to assess their specific needs and tailor solutions to them. This is key because if you don’t do this, your teams value may be missed.4.

It is impossible to shoulder the burden and unless it is tracked and measured, it’ll always be a hot mess.I manage this for my team by stating PRs must include documentation for all models that are touched. While this is great for new projects, it even works on existing projects because over time, models that get worked on will be updated.Usually there is a bit of grumbling but once I implemented dbt-osmosis that took care of getting it mostly there and now that we’ve adopted Cursor, the friction is nearly entirely gone.",

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas? Spark has no way to know what you're doing inside the lambda -- it passes in the entire row so it cannot know what columns are being used, or for what -- so it can't optimise anything. For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check. A dataframe filter on spark columns will skip all of that.You should be able to do all of this with dataframes, and it can make various steps easier and more efficient.",

        "body": "> how about check pointing?RDD checkpointing should give you a similar effect, but only within a session and only if you specifically pull that RDD by id. If you rerun the pyspark code you'll generate a new RDD definition. Even though *you* know you'll get the same result, spark can't tell, so it is a new RDD.> I start from RDD but you start with UDFThat's not really the distinction. Both versions are running a python function on the executors with input args being sent over from the spark data. The only distinction with a UDF is that the `udf()` call is a wrapper so that you can call the function as if it were a spark function and send it column definitions, whereas in an `rdd.map()` you pass the function reference (rather than call it), and it takes the whole row as its arg.The main difference is to process everything once and just save the json output as text as you go with no further processing. That will complete the data retrieval step, without mixing in possible issues or errors from anything else that could unnecessarily cause you to have to hit the API again. It is a lot like making a 'bronze layer' for your overall process. There's likely little overhead in writing then reading back the data, since it can likely write the data while it is still processing requests, and also because spark is going to have to go over the data multiple times to infer the json schema anyway.> What is the benefit of using UDF over RDD in first place?Again, it isn't a UDF over an RDD. A UDF is just a way to wrap a python call so you can use it as if it is a spark function that takes columns as input, rather than passing a function reference and that function having to take a whole row.For one thing, it is a bit faster because spark only has to serialise (and python deserialise) the specific columns that go into the function, which can help performance when the row is very wide. It also means that spark can potentially skip execute the UDF entirely, if its output isn't required for anything.A benefit with using DataFrames is that spark can optimise things by cutting out steps that aren't necessary. Here as an example you can run locally -- just do a `pip install pyspark` and make sure you have openjdk17 with JAVA_HOME set. import json from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit from pyspark.sql.types import StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() data = [ (\"A\", 0), (\"A\", 100), (\"B\", 0), (\"B\", 100), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=\"category STRING, offset INT\") input_df.show() def python_func(category: str, offset: int) -> str: with open(\"side_effect.txt\", \"a\") as filewriter: filewriter.write(f\"{category}:{str(offset)}\\n\") return \"--\" python_func_udf = udf(python_func, StringType()) ( input_df.filter(col(\"category\") == lit(\"A\")).withColumn( \"python_func_call\", python_func_udf(col(\"category\"), col(\"offset\")) ) ).write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"overwrite\").save()If you run this once and open `side_effect.txt` you'll see that it *only* has rows where the input data `category` column is equal to `\"A\"`. Spark *completely skipped* processing the other rows, and the python function was never called for them.In your original example spark *cannot* know what the result of the filter is going to be, because it is being done in Python code. Therefore it must execute the entire source RDD and push every row in its entirety through the filter function in order to get the correct results. This is what causes the execution of the 'invoices' json rdd to also hit the api for the purchase_orders endpoint, even though that data won't go into that RDD.If you use DataFrames from the beginning, and use a DataFrame filter to pick the table you are processing, spark will *only* hit the API for the rows that match your filter, even though you specified the filter in a later step. You could avoid this double-processing without even trying.---The actual suggestion is to stick with DataFrames and just save the data immediately. Then after pulling down the data from the API -- which is *highly* likely to be the slow part -- and saving it, you can just read it back to do everything you need. You *have* the data, you just need to process it. You can take the response json strings and write them out to 'text' files, then read them back in 'json' format and spark will do all the schema inference for you. You can even automatically split up the writes by table in a single pass by setting a partition on the tablename, then read back just the files for a specific table. from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, explode_outer from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() # set up API calls data = [ (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 0), (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 100), (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 200), (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 0), (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 150), (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 300), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=\"tablename STRING, endpoint STRING, offset INT\") def fetch_responses(endpoint: str, offset: int) -> list[str]: response_body = YOUR_REQUEST_RESPONSE return response_body fetch_responses_udf = udf(fetch_responses, ArrayType(StringType())) # define the process to fetch the data and save it as-is to avoid reprocessing due to errors responses_col = fetch_responses_udf(col(\"endpoint\"), col(\"offset\")).alias(\"response_array\") get_everything_df = input_df.select(\"*\", responses_col) get_everything_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(SOME_SCRATCH_SPACE_PATH) # use the saved data to generate the per element data and save to separate folders per table fetch_each_col = explode_outer(responses_col).alias(\"response\") per_element_df = get_everything_df.select(\"tablename\", fetch_each_col) per_element_df.write.format(\"text\").partitionBy(\"tablename\").save(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL_TABLEDATA) # now read back for your desired tablename - this uses the hive style partitioning to pick just one table invoices_df = spark.read.format(\"json\").load(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL + \"/tablename=invoices\")",

Additionally you could do the following: How my org does it is we have a staging directory where pipelines write data ready to be loaded (event driven when we get a new raw file to transform). The loading process is a scheduled job every x minutes that takes all the staged data, and performs an upsert against our data warehouse. I use upsert sort of loosely here because if you have append only, then you can simply create a temp table in bigquery with all the staged data, query your existing warehouse for any matches, if there are any matches then you can delete all the matches from your temp table, and then insert whatever is left into the warehouse.",

Talk about completed projects and their impact on the business and how you navigated the human factor. Tech should be an \"of course you can\" for someone with your seniority - unless you are applying for a pure developer position , which as i mentioned has more limited prospects.3. Very big companies ask for that, but many startups and medium sized companies that are no longer startups do not. So yes.background, i am in berlin where we barely have large companies",

If you still have some time before moving, start talking to people ( and a lot of people ) Canada is full of helpful people, and when it comes to referrals they will help put your name to the hiring talent team or HM.

Some users simply take the time to write clearly and helpfully.Here are a few things that might help identify AI-generated content more accurately::ice: **Tone consistency** — AI responses often maintain a neutral, overly formal tone throughout. :mouse_trap: **Over-explaining** — They sometimes provide more context than needed, even for simple questions. :bust_in_silhouette: **Lack of personal experience** – Posts may feel generic or disconnected from real-world use. :repeat_button: **Repetitive structure** – Paragraphs often follow similar patterns or phrasing. :bullseye: **Imprecision when challenged** – When asked for clarification, the responses might become vaguer or avoid specifics.It’s understandable to feel frustrated, especially when authenticity is hard to gauge—but thoughtful moderation and engaged users can still help keep the sub valuable.",

In my company (small indie game development company), we have that thing going, where everyone is supposed to read 1 book about game development or any topic related to it in any way, and then present the book in a short conversation within the team, so that everyone learns the most notable pointers from it.\\-> benefits of doing this: team building, information sharing, learning to be charismatic, learning to analyse, learning to make clean summaries, and obviously everyone learns the good parts without \"wasting\" extra time (\"good\" may be subjective - which again supports the thought of having the books, so everyone that is interested in certain topics can read the related book at any given time without depending on the internet and without requiring to have electronics with + reading on paper can be mind soothing, nicely outside in the garden or nature or a quiet room or such)Even if some books offer not much knowledge for us anymore, it is important to see other peoples view on the topics to not get stuck in a tunnel vision of knowledge. Every book that offers at least one advice or reminds you of something (may it be simple and obvious) that you just lost track of, is a good book :D \\-> Certain courses and other material is important too, since nowadays there are other ways to learn also, for example via. AI / Audio books / podcasts / streams / videos / meet-up's / lectures.....\\-> Books are not and will never be fully replaced, due to their availability and independencyIf anyone is interested in specific books that have to do with game development, contact me in a DM or on this post, then i may give some recommendations and some \"not worth it\" mentions hehe.Kind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team :)",

Because you will be less frustrated by little task like rename etc…Learn also about bash or shell. They are so cool. You can automate everything, even your programs.

It would help you to review the stuff you should have learned.Other things to consider is learning a second language for small programs (like Python, which can also be used for bigger programs but is nice when you want to write a 100 line program to do something simple). The other is learning git.Write down the things you need to learn. Prioritize the list. Try to focus on just 2-3 things (or less) and try to keep it short term. Once a week, write down how well the past week went. If you achieved the tasks, write that down. If you didn't, write that down. Try to determine how it went. You could simply start by writing down what you do all day in a daily calendar (one of those that let you enter stuff day by day, or you can use Google Docs or something).The issue is you just coasted along, and there will be a strong inclination to coast again even though you realize you shouldn't have coasted.

This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.In my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.Ultimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.Practically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.If you play Minecraft, learn Java. You’ll be able to write mods for the game and play with them and this will help you keep your curiosity and enthusiasm.",

When I introduce functions the concept isn't exactly hard but a lot of my students don't immediately understand WHY to use them.OOP is usually taught as its own course for a reason. It starts off easy enough in concept but can get very confusing to manage pretty quickly.DSA is similar, starts off easy then gets very confusing very fast. This isn't something I've taught a lot because honestly I'm still learning it myself. For me its often an issue of \"I'm not sure when/why I'd use this\" which is 100% a lack of experience causing me to struggle to see the bigger picture.",

The first owl is going from writing a script that strings together some libraries that are actually doing the heavy lifting, to actually doing that heavy lifting. Like your python program might pull in a networking library and do some basic stuff like scrape a website. But then if you have to implement your own networking library because of some weird requirement you're in a world of hurt because you don't know how anything actually works and/or you don't really understand how to write an algorithm or architect larger software. So this owl might actually be three: understanding the technical details of various parts of the stack, how to write an algorithm that's correct and performant in the right way, and how to structure larger pieces of software for things like maintainability, clarity, testability, etc. Second owl, I think, is \"productionalizing.\" There's an old meme or joke about \"works on my computer\" which is a groaner for professional programmers who have had to deal with the kind of amateur cowboys who write code that only sorta kinda works, like they ran it once on their computer, and pushed it out to production, breaking everything. Making a program work at all is like the prototype phase, then like 90% of the work is making it correct, robust, reliable across different machines, etc. That's a whole discipline.",

You can dog-ear the pages of a book or add post-its or tabs wherever you need them, and that makes finding what you need very fast.",

In that case, it's not only that the client cannot see the response, but the browser also won't send the POST request in the first place unless the server first allows it via CORS headers in response to an OPTIONS preflight request.That's not true for all POST requests though. Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=\"bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post. Browsers retained this capability because they didn't want to break all the legitimate websites that rely on this behavior to this day.This is why you need anti-csrf tokens to hand form POSTs. I think https://smagin.fyi/posts/cross-site-requests/ is a great summary on why we have both CSRF protections and CORS. It's mostly history.

If the backend doesn't your browser will block the loading.It's purely in the browser and isn't any form of actual safety - think of it more like a nanny or guardrails.

The number of projects I or friends of mine have started and never finished massively outweighs the ones completed, that's the nature of things. Even the ones that got done were a struggle, you have to decide when something is truly worth pushing through for and make yourself do it (sometimes because you really believe in it, sometimes just because you're being paid). Otherwise chalk it up to learning and move on. I think the main thing is for you to release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself. Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us. You are not special, or in other words, you're as special as any of us. Everyone fails sometimes, even the best in the world, everyone can compare to another and think \"damn I wish I had that\". As long as you keep going, maybe some day you can make something amazing and be someone special for that moment - but that moment always fades, glory never lasts forever. Nobel prize winners will wake up one morning and dread plugging away at the next thing, wondering if they've lost their touch... point I'm making is you carry on going regardless, sprinting or crawling, that's the only way it all happens. No-one stops \"feeling like a failure\", not permanently. Don't stress the low points, and try to keep your mind clear so you can recognise when you've got the chance for brilliance and take it when it happens. Personally, and this is where the sub might disagree, my excitement and curiosity is all around the crazy progress being made in AI tech. Big changes are on the horizon, if you ask me, so try to stay flexible and see if you can take advantage of that in some way. The job market is bad for non-seniors right now, but we have no idea how it's going to shake out over the coming year or so. Stay alert, learn whatever you can, and hold on for the ride. Anyone telling you they *know* what's about to happen is lying, or foolish. TL;DR - Finish your masters. - If you can get a job, any job, great. Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech. - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO). - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life. - Relax. As much as is possible. You're 22, you have many, many high points and low points ahead of you. - Do your best and hope. This is also advice to literally every other person who reads this, and myself.",

The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.One big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.These days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be \"elite.\" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.Still, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.At the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.So hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others. Just focus on getting a little better each day — that’s how long, fulfilling careers are built. Yes i chucked this into chat gpt to fix my terrible grammar. Because...technology... head up pal.",

        "body": "Perfectly normal.It takes a lot longer than you might expect to get good at this. School teaches you a mixed bag of general things in order to give you a solid foundation. Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.If they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.Also, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called \"code smells\" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: \"this is garbage\", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving. Good luck and don't sweat the small stuff.",

For me, the real 'secret' is knowing how to think about a problem, how to break it down, piece by piece, until a piece can be turned into functioning code with tests etc etc.There is an 'art' to it, some solutions work better than others, one old but still relevant book is the \"Design Patterns\", [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design\\_Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) Reading it will give you some really good techniques and insights into ways of breaking things down.It takes time to truly understand this job, it's not just typing all day, that's the end result of hours of deep thought, design of data structures, process flows, lots of things. Indeed the final language is almost irrelevant unless it has certain features that support your solutions architecture, that is to say, if you have chosen \"OO\" then any good OO language should be up to implementing your solution.Just read for half-an-hour a day from the Gang of Four book, it's as good a place as any other to gain insights.Another book to read and continue to dip into, for me at least is:\"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein.Yes, that Ron Rivest of of RSA crypto!Good luck with it all.",

But when it comes to the implementation, don't copy the code line by line.You are going to learn so much about something you've probably only just used on a surface level by falling into all the pitfalls by simply trying to reimplement it. There will be wild edge cases and obscure bugs you find when you test it.It should be a very naive implementation at first. Just a basic proof of concept, you can keep improving it. You will get to a point where you realise your initial mental model for the project was dogshit, and adding new features is hard. Good. Time to refactor.If you can see these projects through to at least a reasonable stage of complexity, you will learn so much and have a lot to talk about at interviews. Why did you choose to implement it via x vs y, what challenges did you overcome?It's important that the project has meat and is challenging. It's meant to be hard. You will learn the most by screwing up again and again and then getting it right. It's very hard to learn something intimately by just blasting through a simple project that doesn't challenge you, even if your brain loves the 'success'Good luck!",

The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then \"compile\" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working. Then later on you can always experiment further with writing and running the program in different ways!",

Static assets include images, fonts, and other media stored in the repository.When it comes to just the code and HTML output, 1GB is a huge amount of space. For example, I could easily deploy a fake blog with 3000 pages, and it still wouldn't come close to that limit.But if you start adding images, videos, or audio, the size grows quickly.

        "body": "Python, even though very popular, seems like is never the right tool for the job. Its interpreted style makes it quite slow, and the dynamic typing makes Pydantic almost a must use. Not to mention that maintaining a large Python codebase is quite hard, and poses many underlying challenges. It’s not all bad of course. You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.Golang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.I’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java. Java and Spring Boot power huge systems worldwide reliably. Java has extremely rich tooling (I’d even say more so than Python). Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours. Spring Boot is probably the best web framework to have ever used personally and is comparable and even more feature-full than Django. On top of that the language itself is quite easy and nice to work with.",

You could definitely trim this down to like... half the size and still make the same point just by getting rid of the \"and now I'm going to talk about ______\" sections. Just say it, you don't have to *announce* that you're going to say it before you do.Anyway, the idea that corporations wanting things other than to create the most aesthetically pleasing code is \"greed\" is... Silly. As you mention in the article, if you create the most pleasant to look at, neatly organized code *that doesn't work,* you haven't created a \"masterpiece,\" you have created a dud. I could arrange the pieces of a car engine in them most pleasing, feng sui design I can, but *if the car doesn't drive* (or if it only drives unbearably slowly, or unreliably, or can't turn corners, ect) then the end result fails at its intended purpose.I think your article really helped cement for me, the idea that \"clean code\" is an *aesthetic* sensibility, not (at least primarily) a practical one. While there's some value in making things more aesthetic, and some of the principles of some conceptions of \"clean code\" overlap with functional concerns... It's always primarily about *what looks nice,* not what does the job the software was intended to do.I think it's a bit of a separate point to say that the code that exists is often influenced by the transient concerns of a complex system that produced / influenced the code, but... You're also not wrong about that. When we're looking at code someone else produced, we shouldn't assume they *intended* the code to look the way it does, in the sense that they approached a blank file and *decided* to produce the code you see. Far more often programmers are given an existing file, and told to \"make it work\" *without* enough time or resources to do a \"proper\" job. In a sense this is still \"bad\" code because it's creating legitimate technically debt... But it may not be bad because *the programmer* was bad - it may the best code that the programmer could create, given the constraints they were working with. (The most important of which was \"make it do what we want it to do.\")Only sometimes is that because of true \"greed\" - usually it's because like any system, corporations have incentives to operate as close as possible to the line of failure, (hopefully *without* going over it, or having an acceptably low risk or failure anyway) in order to deliver the most functionality for least cost. That's stressful and upsetting for the humans tasked with \"making it work\" in that environment... But it's a *feature of any complex system,* not just corporations, and not just \"greedy\" systems. (except where \"greedy\" means \"getting the most reward for least cost.\")",

What matters is that you pick something you find interesting and keep working on it. Make it bigger, more complex. Make it polished and professional. Challenge yourself to make it better.

        "body": "I have a little over 3.5 years of experience, and I’m at a mid-level position. I work in web dev.If I was starting out again, I’d do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.After becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I’d stop utilizing that approach for learning. I’d then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I’d start building tons of projects.The AI assistance I’d use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can’t just use it to build everything for you. Then you’re not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you’d have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.After building tons of projects, I’d get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.After doing this, I’d research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI’s help. AI isn’t thinking of security. You need to be. I’d download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don’t, it’s not because you don’t have any. It’s because you can’t find them.I myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can’t give you much more advice there, but that’s a starting point!The thing is, I’m providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.You also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won’t. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs. I was willing to do the dirty work when it came up, and I was also always willing to listen to my coworkers whenever they had constructive feedback.Some of my coworkers have described me as “starving” and “hungry” to learn. I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.The thing is, they’re working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn’t about the money. It’s about the experience. I don’t get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it’s about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.Finally, place yourself in positions where you’re not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you’re the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It’s a waste of your time unless you’re building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it’s primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.In code, don’t get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they’re very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.In the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible. My goal is to get higher quicker so that I can r/FIRE when I want to, where I want to, if I want to. I’m already in a position to coast FIRE. I am doing this for my freedom, and as a passion to program. You need to know why you’re doing this. Find your why. Remember your why. Be the “how” for your “why”.",

Being a programmer means having to deal with new stuff all the time. Sure, there are some jobs where you can deal with legacy code and not have to stay up-to-date. That's fine. Not everyone is hopping on the latest and greatest. But the typical programmer has to worry about it.For example, AI is the new big thing.

Build an app that tracks stats for your favorite sport, or a color palette manager for your digital art hobby, or turn your resume into an interactive website. Most importantly though, don’t wait until you’ve learned everything to try one of these projects. Try to push your skills as far as you can after every lesson.

But, others only go because they have to and their personal health holds them accountable for going. However programming is a career / hobby so you shouldn’t rely on accountability at all as motivation to do it. Also people who make blogs and vlogs and stuff they do not necessarily do that for accountability either, they once again do it because they want to. Hope that helps!",

Start with FCC and do the html/css/JS content until you finish it, get painfully bored, or feel like you're spinning your wheels. When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.That's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.By the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp. It sounds like the market is pretty bad for bootcampers these days, so dunno if I'd recommend it in 2025. In my case, I did the bootcamp after coding off and on for like 2 years though. So YMMV. Good luck!",

It’s great if you’re doing data analysis or machine learning or anything with good c bindings, but otherwise it’s slow and the syntax is not remotely c-style (which I personally prefer)Java: modern Java is a great language for enterprise software, but I still find it too verbose for my personal tasteGo definitely has some drawbacks (no enums and fairly non-expressive type system,) but barring typescript, it’s the most productive language for me",

What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too \"at the beginning\", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",

I absolutely don't want to make light of bullying but the fact that this is not the other way around is certainly a thing... To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, \"just allow yourself to get into it\". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua. You don't have to worry about it being \"basic\" for now, you are picking up the essential skills. My personal 'prime directive' advice is simply, \"just pick something you would like to try to make and start trying to make it!\". When somebody crosses fields like this I always suggest mining their knowledge of their other field to see if there are any ideas you can think of that might be useful. It doesn't have to make you a billionaire, it doesn't have to even ever get used, it just needs to give you an idea to focus on, so you can use programming as a means to an end.... that's what you'll be expected to do if you work in the field and strangely it is also where you learn the most. It all happens while you are trying to figure out how to do something.",

That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be reading up on design patterns, data structures, language details, and algorithms. It just means that you do need to put that stuff into practice. You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process. You should absolutely pick up source control, ideally, as you noted, git. You don’t need to be a wizard. Just get good enough that you’re not bricking your repo and losing progress all the time. Just absolute everyone uses it, and if they’re not, they’re still using source control, so the ideas are still good to know about. C++ can be tough for people. Between pointers, dependencies, templates, (Pre)Build Systems, and more, it’s not the easiest language. If it’s what you want to use though, you’ve really gotta just put your head down and learn enough to get cracking on some small to medium sized projects and get comfortable with some basic dependency management. Just in general, you’ll need to start thinking about writing code if your classes aren’t doing it. I was never a competitive programmer, nor did I do a ton of the puzzle or algorithm sites. My school was team project focused, and was self driven. So I was working on projects for 8 semesters. Often in between as well since they’d carry over. And I’d have side projects to learn a thing that I might bring back into the main project. I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). I found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you.

Most of the CS classes used FORTRAN-IV on a PDP-11/40 running RSTS/E timesharing.But I will try anyway...The key to Computer Science, Software Engineering, and programming in general (all different, though related, disciplines) is problem solving - recognizing a problem, decomposing it into smaller problems, and solving each of those smaller pieces in a way that solves the larger problem when brought back together.By \"problem\", I don't mean \"error\" or \"malfunction\"; I mean the thing you are trying to accomplish when you set out.The language and things like git are tools that you apply to this, and different tools lead to different paths to solving a problem. You need to know how to use the tools you have, but problem solving is the skill you need to develop independent of the tools; you simply apply the tools at hand when solving the problem. The tools are changing continuously, don't get hung up on the tools themselves.Whether you are in the right field of study is something you must determine. Are you interested in it? Do you enjoy the challenges it provides? Do you see an opportunity to expand your skills and make meaningful contributions to projects or the field as a whole after getting your bachelor degree? Have you identified what subset of the discipline you are most interested in pursuing?You need to be motivated, interested, and willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Developing critical problem solving skills is essential to success. Without it, you might as well be an accountant. I expect there's also aptitude - some people are faster at picking this up than others.Ask yourself why you chose this path in the first place, and whether those reasons are still compelling to you. Is there something else you would rather be doing? There's no shame in changing directions - I went from civil engineering to computer science in my 4 years. You don't always know enough going in to pick the right major.",

That can lead to code that's inefficient, or it can lead to not being able to understand why your code isn't working.Note that CS programs tend to teach very little about tools, frameworks, and libraries that are currently used in industry. That frustrates some students because they don't feel job-ready, but the reality is that those things change frequently. Schools focus on the fundamentals that are universal and timeless.But yeah, there's nothing different about the programming. It doesn't matter whether you're a CS major or not. Some of the best programmers I've ever known were some other major - often physics or engineering.I'd say another difference is what your goal is in programming. If your goal is purely to solve a problem - like you need to write a program that figures out the answer to one question, then you'll never use it again - then a lot of what you learn in CS probably doesn't matter.If you're trying to build robust, efficient, powerful software that lots of people can use and rely on, the stuff you learn in CS is a lot more relevant.",

You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.However, where it differs is in how programming is used.

And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).In contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.Computation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on \"tried-and-true\" methods of programming - no \"seat of the pants\" stuff there.The best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.Some of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.Mechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a \"fly-by-wire\" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.In these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.Some Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.I don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.As you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.The real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.As for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?It's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 \"ways of thinking\" when it comes to programming.The last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own \"special sauce\" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.Even though the \"lone programmer\" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.If you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.Hope this little overview helps and good luck!",

My suggestion is always to find a **complete** tutorial on something like udemy for $10-$20 and use it. Make sure it's a Beginner to expert tutorial that covers all aspects of the technology. If it's something big like JavaScript as a whole or React as a whole or all of Python, it should be at least 20-30 hours long. Go through the tutorial with the teacher, WRITE everything in your own IDE, do not just watch or listen, write it out yourself, the more senses you use in learning, the more likely your brain will consider it important. Watching a video is alright. Watching a video and taking notes is better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them (and getting it to work) is far better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them and then teaching it to someone else is even better. If you have no one to teach it to, teach it to the wall, or a chair, or a rubber duck, or whatever. The key is you need to be able to explain what is happening, or you don't really know what is happening.Once you're done doing the entire tutorial with the lecturer, if you feel up to it, start working on your own project. First create the repo with the technology boiler plate, don't know how? How did they do it in the tutorial? Then add some hardcoded text and things to the page. How? Check the tutorial. Then make the data dynamic and add a list of objects using a for loop, how? Check the tutorial. Then call an API, how? Check the tutorial. You get the picture.",

Have code review with a senior 7. Get told to implement it in a third way or improve the current implementation 8. Implement the final version 9. Be happy you learned Repeat. That works well as long as you are careful with the seniors time. If you both understand that it goes hand in hand between you trying to prep as much as you can before asking them and then them understanding that their advice can save you days of trial and error, then you have a wonderful path for growth.

I'm new to computer science and programming as well and at first I though the whole \"practice\" advice was just basic cliché, but it's actually the best way you're going to learn anything in programming. I've recently been learning JavaScript OOP and it's been tricky so every time there was a new example or a new method or a new topic I'd do it myself in VSCode after learning it. And, even though I'm still inexperienced, I now feel very comfortable with the dreaded \\`this\\` keyword and prototypal inheritance, today I finished one of my biggest projects and 99% of it was JS OOP. Practice is your best friend.I would highly avoid using AI to write any of your code. Especially if you're in a place where you're learning and you're not really sure about how things work or what to do. Programming is all about problem solving and AI will completely remove the whole problem solving part of it if you use to write code. Use AI to ask questions for your projects, to debug, to quickly confirm something you're not sure about. But, don't use it to write code if you're still learning. AI writes none of my code, I think about what I want to do and check docs first, if I can't find it I'll ask AI, but I will never just blindly copy and paste code from AI, because the whole point of me coding is to learn, and it should be the same for you. Learn through tutorials, reading docs, and building projects, don't rely on AI. AI should be the last thing in your mind when you're writing code and looking to learn it.",

Make yourself do weird stuff with it, container in container in container anything you can think of, will help with cards later on and understanding parent and children. The random transform stuff you will use when needed and just google, hover the same thing, and you'll just remember it from then on. Display switches and other stuff just come with projects, but you won't use long-term, dark mode you'll use later on. It's a lot, but look at a page and ask yourself how that is there or why does it looks like that and recreates it. A great site would be apple to clone with html and css. Also, when structuring, I always give each container a random ass background color, which visually helps understanding what's going on. Good luck, and you got this!",

You've mentioned you're doing free code camp which is good, but their editor is very barebones. I think learning \"the hard way\" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \\- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \\- Firefox has similar, use the one you like. I've linked to the \"element\" section which helps answer the question \"why doesn't this thing do the thing I thought it should\". On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \\- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \\- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line. I've linked the framework I use, it will generate you CSS variables for free but there are plenty of other options available. Avoid tailwind until you actually understand CSS, once you've got a good handle on it give it a spin.",

        "body": "Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",

Competitions create a small number of winners and a large number of losers. Read this sub for a week and you’ll come to understand that lots of beginning programmers already feel that they’re not smart enough to ever really succeed.Competition pits people against each other. I get that some people enjoy testing themselves that way, and that’s fine, but it’s not for everyone. What particular skills do you think competition will teach or sharpen? Time management? Planning and decision making? Task prioritization? Whatever they are, why can’t you teach those skills some other way?In the real world, programming is much more about collaboration and teamwork than competition. The best programmers teach and inspire the people around them, and that helps them improve too. People spend time answering questions on sites like StackOverflow because helping others solve problems is a great way to learn. Is there a way that you can use collaboration to help your students improve? Maybe have the stronger students coach the weaker ones?",

Competition is good when adapted, but it can crush them. I wouldn't push one of my student that isn't too motivated.You can make them do more creative stuff in a \"safe zone\" for them. For example a programming jam \"against\" each others: you choose a random word, they must code something inspired by the word. Or just make them do something that interest them like their game or website.I also assume that some are just not that interested in programming and forcing them is pointless..TL;DR: don't search a way to convince them, that's the worst you can do.

        "body": "I was in 9th grade in 1988 and loved programming, I wanted to be a programmer, but everyone talked about that in a few years, programmers wouldn't be necessary due to something called CASE-tools, where business-types could simply draw networks of rules in some fancy program, and that would then create the code needed. Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.So I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. In the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.Then languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.Then a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.In the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.And now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us. The problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve \"yesterdays problems\". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.So go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff! Programming is always a good thing to learn - most of us won't work with the technologies we began learning on, but getting into the mindset of solving problems and building software, will always be a good thing! Even when the tech changes - only specific tech-knowledge becomes obsolete, but usually you use it to make learning the next thing easier!",

AI is a useful tool for making software more quickly, but software development and computer science in the real world is far more than simply generating code. Recently there has been an economic shrinking and quite a lot of software developers were laid off in 2023 as AI was emerging, but AI is not replacing ALL developers, it's making them a little more efficient, so companies may need fewer but that's still not as settled as some may think. AI is also prone to hallucinations and many major companies, such as my current employer, will not use it and are NOT sharing their code into AI as they want to protect their intellectual property. If your high school has a vocational program that includes computer programming, consider enrolling. It is a great head start for college, my youngest son went that route and currently works for a major insurance company. Then consider a college major in computer science.

Companies that have tried it even as a replacement for junior engineers have had to walk back the decision after realizing how hard the quality and functionality of their software plummeted. It's a good tool for \\*assisting\\* human engineers but decades away from a replacement if not more. Stick with programming. If you love it, it'll make you happy and lots of money.

Some advice I was given was leave in my comments and explanations in my code for the repository. It shows I actually understand and gives a view on how my logical thinking works. Looking for work while going back to college has been daunting. I did a 1 year advanced cert to get into uni but I haven’t received the award yet and nobody is recognising it as completed until I have the physical copy. CS50 was a great way to test the waters of wether I wanted to do programming full time and the community college recognised CS50 allowing me to skip the first year of that course (it should have been 2 years). LeetCode and those are ok for interview prep and preparing yourself but start making some projects of your own to show you have a full understanding of how to build, edit and manage programs. The portfolio is t only example of what you can actually do.",

I’m making projects based of their requirements. Using them as work example briefs and not applying for them. Yes I’m not doing the actual “job” I’m trying to get into but bills need to be paid with an actual job.

I learned Python back in 2010-2012 and had no application for it. I made a deck shuffler and a character creator for a generic text based RPG, and then dropped it. I never programmed again until 2017 when I actually saw programming potential in an artistic/design context I was studying at that time. And then it clicked. I devoured every online lesson or book I could find. And went deep.It is so important to frame a goal or problem you wanna solve. Makes the journey more motivating.Wanna get into AI, Cybersecurity or Automating stuff: PythonWanna get into Web: JavaScriptWanna get into Games: C# or C++It really doesn't matter.

So when in doubt, go a bit further!A lot of modern frameworks also has separate folders for each component, and either css, html and js for that component in three files, or sometimes joined in one.

Keep it up!I think you have a great sense to organize code (it's referred to as \"clean code\"). If you keep programming, this will be a very useful skill, for all kinds of things that you will do.Nowadays, you don't write CSS the way you did a few years ago. Nowadays, you have tools like TailwindCSS or frameworks like Bulma CSS. Also, JavaScript frameworks change the way you use CSS. E.g. Angular encapsulates CSS into components. That said, it is still perfectly fine to use \"vanilla CSS\".There were opinions on how to structure CSS, but none has been really pervasive. There were also build steps like SASS or SCSS.I think your approach is perfectly fine. The only disadvantage I see is that your browser has to fetch each of those files individually, which is not the most efficient way. But it's not so problematic, either.Do you work already with the MDN docs? It's a great resource, e.g. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn\\_web\\_development/Core/Styling\\_basics/Organizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Organizing)",

Organizing your CSS into separate files like header.css, utilities.css, and modals.css can make your codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate, especially as your project grows. This modular approach is a common practice in web development.While it's true that having multiple CSS files can lead to additional HTTP requests, which might slightly affect load times, the trade-off is often worth it for the improved organization and maintainability. Many developers use build tools to combine and minify CSS files for production, mitigating performance concerns.Your project, “Obscuria Terminal,” sounds intriguing, and it's commendable that you're learning from your dad's notes. Keep experimenting and refining your workflow; you're on a solid path.",

My first programming language I learned was c++ back in freshman year of college. I wanted to make a packet sniffer to triangulate locations (legally ofc). I knew nothing about c++, networks, structure of packets, etc. I learned by starting the project and googling everything as I went. My hours of suffering and confusion have practically ingrained all of the important information I lacked at the time into my mind. Sitting down and learning something is valuable, but in my opinion you should be “doing”, more than stuffing your head into some books. When I did esports I learned how important just “raw-dogging” it is. I studied footage for like 2 hours then practiced for 8 hours, trying to apply whatever was identified in the footage. Had a really good coach who really taught me how to learn.Remember an engineer doesn’t just make stuff. You will inevitably need to deal with something you lack experience in. Obviously make sure the scope of the project isn’t insane. Scope management is also a skill of an engineer. You likely wont make a great product your first few attempts but start the process of failing a lot and learning now.",

        "body": "Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. A compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. Meanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. The standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. In actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. See if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. There are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. In the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. For example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",

        "body": "For your first question, just create a checksum before compressing the folder. Then decompress it and check the decompressed file against the checksum. If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.You should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.Ideally your system works like this.1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server2. System generates checksum for project file/folder4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)5. System compresses project file into archive file6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)8. System generates checksum for the archive file9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working serverIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.As for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.There are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.Finally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already. If these files are critical enough to warrant all this work, the least you can do is pay a bit extra for offsite storage to ensure you can recover if the archive server blows up. Cold storage on AWS is extremely affordable.",

I’m learning many things I didn’t know before and feel like I’m pretty close to being able to transition. A CS degree isn’t always a requirement. A cert, bootcamp, or experience can be just as good.The big issue for me, like you, will be taking a pay cut. As an IT Manager I make good money, so I’ll have to find the right thing. I don’t want to live in a major city, so that will hold me back as well. My plan is to create some side hustle things, easy things like a Secret Santa app to gain experience. Despite being somewhat worried, I’m still going to do it, and you should too. At your current salary level I couldn’t imagine you needing to take much of a pay cut either.",

Maybe start by reading their documentation, the pages on how to contribute and get started, check if they have communication channels like an open discord or slack that can help you integrate into the project. Then just clone the project and start reading through the code. Start small, try understanding a small section of the code and how it interacts with other features.That said, you wouldn’t expect to start a job at a company and magically know the code base in an instant.

[https://www.learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) is not bad, but it can still be a challenge if you're not already a savvy computer user.The second is that C++ is utterly unforgiving and confusing, so before long you will hit error messages or behavior that you just don't understand. You will get stuck and need help. If you don't have access to anyone who can help you in person, please plan on posting here on r/learnprogramming or other forums.It's not that this will never happen with other languages, but in comparison if you wanted to try learning Python or web dev first, you could probably get a lot further without getting stuck.",

I'd expect most, if not all of the coding examples found in the book would compile with a modern C++ compiler, so learning from that book will not cause any damage, and you will be learning C++ proper.Obviously, once you've mastered C++ from that book, then learn what changes were made to the language for these four later versions and go about learning what new features were added by these later versions.So, to learn how to program C++, install a C++ compiler and start typing in the code examples from these books and get that code to run. Then go back to code and try to understand how that code the works. If you manage to work your way through both of these books, you'll be well on the way to being a C++ programmer.",

I'd not put pay at the very top of your priority list provided you'll be able to live without too much discomfort. There's time for that, and I probably wouldn't worry about the 9 month term on the internship on the basis that I think it is about equally likely that they will let you go after the 9 month period as it would be for one of the others to let you go for other reasons in that 9 month period. This is not to say the latter is likely but more that the former isn't.The bottom line though is that experience in anything is going to be a huge asset for you. If you have something on the table that you really like the sound of, i'd personally not piss about too much with counter offers and paralysis by analysis.

Reporting, oversight, all that jazz. But the one thing that gets neglected is the end user experience. In your case, that means the wait staff that uses the software dozens of times over the course of a shift.Focus on that workflow. Start there and constantly refine that workflow as you build out other aspects of the software. Use the software daily to do a bunch of fake transactions. Find the parts that annoy you and fix them. Make it as efficient and smooth as possible. Model user behavior and situations. Talk to real life wait staff and get input on what they hate about their current point of sale.Don't worry about making mistakes, they are inevitable. Trying to account for every possible situation from the beginning is how you end up with a bloated, unusable, over-engineered piece of garbage. You can always refactor, and arguably should refactor quite frequently, especially as you discover the real requirements for the software in early versions.",

If you don’t absolutely need acid then at scale you sometimes move away from it by either denormalizing the hell out of your schema or moving to something intended for non-acid.

Reddit was originally modeled with comments being rows which have straightforward relations to other comments that are their children or they are children of.- At scale you bust naive RDB index caches all the time if you don’t model your product around how it’s cached by the engine. - Reddits product revolves around sufficiently timely elevation and surfacing of the right comments. This was originally hyper-naive in a request time sort done independently for every comment thread fetch. Staying close enough to this to still have a good product but far enough to cache and scale efficiently is critical.",

The first thing I'd suggest is zooming in with Ctrl+Plus - get it large enough that you don't have to sit as close to your computer screen.Actually maybe consider changing the resolution of your monitor. You'll be better off with a low resolution - fewer pixels on the screen, but larger. That will make everything on the UI larger.If you're using a laptop, I highly recommend getting an external monitor. It will be life-changing. And they're not expensive - a 10-year-old used monitor will work just fine. You don't need fancy, just physically large.Next, Jupyter Notebook has themes, here's a tutorial. A dark theme might work better for you, or just otherwise adjust the colors to your taste.[https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/](https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/)If you're not doing mostly machine learning and working with numerical data and plots, you'll be better off with a tool like Visual Studio Code, which has amazing accessibility themes and features. It works great with both Python and Java.Also check out the accessibility settings on your operating system, whether Windows or Mac - there are tons of features intended for people just like you. Get a large, brightly-colored mouse cursor, keyboard shortcuts to zoom in on anything, and much more.",

The idea is to balance the creative and logical parts of your workday, like a yin and yang for your brain.When building websites, games, or applications, there’s always a mix of creative and logical tasks. Front-end work involves UX decisions that require logic, while back-end development can benefit from a creative mindset, too.Since the left side of your brain handles logic and the right side is all about visual imagination, I separate my tasks based on this.Here’s the trick:While tackling logical tasks, I keep a notepad nearby for any creative ideas or concepts I’m excited to test later. The key is having the discipline not to indulge in those creative tasks immediately or start new projects out of boredom.Instead, I treat those moments of boredom as opportunities. I turn them into a reward system — finish the logical, then enjoy the creative. It keeps your workflow balanced and your energy up.Good luck. :flexed_biceps::thumbs_up:",

There is always resistance to change because to implement change you have to convince a lot of people and also, the thing they're currently doing seems to be working.It's also the case that at big companies, some parts of the business subsidize other parts. And the big tech firms are all kings of this. Google has a handful of products that make stupid amounts of money, and everything else is just for vanity or politics. If you're in one of those core teams, then there will be pressure to perform and also likely lots of scrutiny. And if you're far away from the money-makers your job is to make the pencil pushers who justify your pay cheque happy.Big companies I've worked at and have had colleagues work at also seem to prefer a lot more paperwork and documentation so that they can waterfall all the most cost sensitive parts of their business to offshore teams in countries with lower costs of living. This seems to make it more cost effective to build software, but also to protect all the IP.Some advice I was given is that as an individual at one of these organizations. You can barely see the tip of the iceberg. The culture, history, and trajectory of the part of the business you're in are all potentially decided by people far away. You're literally a cog in the wheel, and whether you fight it or go with it the business is doing exactly what it has planned to do.",

I feel like we are currently at peak AI hype, and it is going to come crashing down hard once people have spent more time with it. Another point is that the models seem to have hit a wall.

But I may be naive on that.>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?Depends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.If I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.CS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",

The supply/demand curve does not care how many times you post on reddit how you don't care about this data and \"you are going to make it\" posts. Eventually the supply/demand curve will slap you in the face when bills come due or your parents get sick of you staying with them while you still don't have a job.I don't know any other major where people keep selecting it if it is clear no jobs are available for new college grads. Anyone who is a college student right now should choose a different STEM major or another major altogether that is actually hiring. This field is not hiring.Don't believe me? Here is a dose of reality. Not only is this field bad, it is the worst of all the STEM fields.

It is currently at the lowest point in those 24 months, too.Software is sitting at 62.9% job postings compared to pre-COVID.IT Operations and Helpdesk also plummeted, though not as bad... until inauguration day. Then it tanked from 84.6% on Jan. 21st, 2025--to 69% (nice) today.On top of this, Science and R&D jobs dropped from inauguration day, as well. Going from 88.5% to 73.9%, in just 5 short months.In that timeframe, there have been more graduates than ever before for these sectors.So, I would say, yes. Software engineering is probably dead for now. And it probably will be for another 3 years and 7 months. Give or take.We currently live in a world where a huge dumbass can take a profitable company (hell, an *industry*) and turn it into a bankrupt one... by simply signing some papers. Threatening the wrong people. Doing something unhinged... And he regularly threatens to do so on a whim.Question: what CEO of a company wants to invest in the future, if the present is super unstable and the future is balanced on the whims of an idiot and his merrymen?Answer: a genius leader who recognizes the biggest opportunity in history to scoop up huge amounts of talent at a bargain price (business leaders are not very smart people, they just go with the flow, and right now that is AI and layoffs).This doesn't mean that you cannot get a job. Nor that software is a totally unreasonable thing to invest time in.

I hate to be the one to break this to you, but even when you're in the right, the company can just wait you out. What number are you thinking of when you say we can \"afford\" to sue? $10k? $100k? $500k?Well, the company will burn 7+ figures without blinking an eye. They can wait your ass out.Is that fair? No, but that's how the court system works. The only hope you'd have is if you can find a lawyer that'll take your case pro-bono with an agreement that they get a majority portion of your settlement.But the problem with that one small hope, is a lawyer doing that, is only going to do it in cases they think they can win.

I did this for a few reasons. 1) it’s a government job, so my benefits are amazing in terms of pension, 401K, healthcare, pay, job security, etc…2) I’ve planned to pivot to more Data Analyst focused roles as it allows me to apply internally within the company to have a better shot at getting into a field I want to be in. 3) My company is also really fond of learning and growth within areas of the company, so if I wanted to shadow or help work on projects with our SSE, I can without question.",

I kind of gave up with cs and is just trying to find any job for some sort of income and getting any kind of experience. I don't think cs is worth it anymore. Maybe I'll try again later when the market gets better but honestly kind of over it. Finding a job is mainly on luck, even if you have years of experience it doesn't mean you'll get a job unless you do 100 other things. You have to network with everyone, have to tailor each and every resume to so you have a chance to pass ATS but you can't have too many key word cause that'll be flagged too, write cover letters and you don't even know if it'll be read by a human or computer. Some companies will give you homework before even speaking to anyone (don't do those you shouldn't have to work for free), pass a minimum of 4 interview rounds, and so on and so forth. If it is honestly something you think is worth putting up with and is passionate about then yah continue with this field. Otherwise maybe it's time to pivot. There are jobs out there that require any type of degree to get started. Definitely not going to pay as much as a dev job, but those salaries are also decreasing.Software development is in a strange category, it's treated as a STEM job but also something similar to art. It is now expected to be working on personal projects outside of work like how art is, but also is insanely technical and time consuming. I don't think many other STEM fields are like this. I don't think chemists are expected to be mixing chemicals in their basement over the weekend, but we are expected to be constantly working on some sort of side project all the time. It's honestly exhausting to keep up with.",

Most job posts are getting a ton of applicants especially if remote. People and bots are just flooding the funnel without even ensuring they align with the role first.2. Unorganized resumes, outside of core time zones, not enough job info, not enough experience, frequent job hopping. On job hopping, the previous mindset of bounce every 2 years can start to ding you at higher levels. There are to many devs on the market who stuck with it and stayed with companies for longer making it hard to roll the dice on someone bouncing around frequently.3. Work life balance. Be strategic how you peel back the onion on this question with some companies. To direct it can seem like you don’t manage your time well or you’re looking to clock in and out. With all the layoffs in the industry teams are having to do more with less. Assume you’re walking into a blended culture and balance your time wisely.

        "body": "I am hiring right now1. Application Volume Very high. BUT many people are spray-and-praying. They're not a fit for the role, they probably know this, but getting as many intros as you can is the name of the game. I totally get it, no beef here.For you this means: if you see a role where your skills line up, GOOD RESUMES STAND OUT, so invest time in your resume and then invest more time in it.2. Instant resume killersYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.If all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.What I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.Illustrating these will impress me more than a contextless \"Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion\"3. Interview stuffI'm always rooting for the candidate. I am also always thinking of my team and thinking, \"how will this person improve us\". Keep that in mind when I'm forced to ask HR question \"tell me a time contrived event happened\". Beyond that, biggest pointers I'd give are\\- I pass plenty of people who struggle in technical qualifiersIf you're struggling, don't panic, but don't try to hide it either. The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think \"well this is close to criticism but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok\", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to \"I'm looking for $goodthing\" and don't say \"past employer had $badthing\". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of \"tell me a time X happened\", don't make one up, just say: \"I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z\". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle. If you just make something up there's nothing real and human there and it does show through. I'd much rather you told me a sort of similar thing you did have to deal with rather than make something upBit of a stream of consciousness there sorry about that.

There were no \"resume killers\", other than receiving a lot of resumes that didn't have the required experience. Most of the applicants were filtered out by our corporate recruiter for not having the required experience on their resume, but one was rejected at the recruiter level for being too arrogant. I have no idea what the applicant did to annoy the recruiter, since I wasn't a part of that interview. Another was rejected by the recruiter because they weren't good at communicating back to the recruiter within a reasonable amount of time.There were a lot of good applicants, and many of them would have no doubt been great hires. We.sent out a programming project to our applicants which had a \"Bonus points for...\" section. A few applicants did the bare minimum,. but the person I hired did well on the test and also completed the \"bonus points\" section. The person was also honest with their weaknesses, which was a plus for us.There is definitely an advantage in being one of the first applicants. Our company has a policy of not having any more than three candidates in the interview process at any given time, so we might have a fantastic candidate who won't be given a chance until we've got less than three people in the interview process.",

However, at the end of those couple weeks, I'll understand it probably better than anybody else on the team. Because I spent that time reading documentation, testing, sleeping on it. I'll have tried a few dozen things that don't work and I'll know why. I'll have gone through 3 different working versions that I looked at, said \"this feels hacky,\" and did a different simpler way. I will become opinionated about it. I'll be familiar with the framework's issue board. My end product will be 7 lines of code, and you'll ask why I spent all that time to produce so little product, but every line will have a complex backstory about why it was the best choice.This will not be a satisfactory consolation to you in virtually every case.The best thing is to be fast and correct.The next best thing is to be fast and complete.The next best thing is to be complete.And somewhere way down the line is whatever I am.We got an enterprise Chat GPT license and I've been vibe coding for a few weeks. I don't think I'm going to work well with it. I ask for something simple and it gives it to me. But I don't understand it, or I don't agree with it. I'm suspicious. I interrogate, why this option? Are you sure you're using the right version of the language? Doesn't this create a security vulnerability? I spend so long debugging and tweaking the model's code that the chat starts to chug with every prompt from all the context I've given it. Then I start over with a new chat and try to take the conversation in a different direction.I spend all my energy critiquing *the model's* solution,  and exploring only paths that the model presents to me. I go out and do some of my own research, and then I have to catch the model up to where I got without it. At the end of a full workday, I haven't learned anything, and I'm not happy with the code I have.",

In fact, many companies assumed CS grads could not code and that it was something they would learn on the job. Before Chat GPT everyone was solving their homework problems by google-fu'ing their way through Stack Overflow. Before Stack Overflow there were message boards (that are still going and have answers that go all the way back to the 90s).Today the tools are much better than they were 20 years ago much less just 5 years ago. However, the tasks assigned to programmers are also exponentially much more difficult to implement. As the tools get better what is asked of the programmer increases.

Get your company's name out there. Buying ads *might* get me to notice you as well.But I don't generally view unsolicited contact in a positive light. Maybe that's just a me thing.

It's pretty universal that when someone, even people not on our team, has a problem they just cannot seem to figure out they go to him and he always finds a way to solve it. He codes everyday, and often works extra hours even though no one has asked him to or implied he should. He has no interest in any sort of management or lead role, he wants to write code and solve problems while others deal with the politics. He's also just a wonderful person in general, incredibly friendly and can talk for hours. I dread the day he decides to finally retire because of the immense loss it will be.",

Not a big deal but like damn I'm willing to do anything to just get back in the industry and being ghosted for an 8 week 25/hr position to schedule an interview just sucks.All my recent hits are just ghosting me, usually I'm getting more chatter and interviews, been 2 full weeks since an interview but I also am behind on applying.My plan is just keep struggling until I get a halfway decent job and then spend 6-12 months to onboard and do my best. After that, if it's a chill job I will just keep interview prepping at work because this is ridiculous.",

        "body": "Speaking from a meta perspective, as someone who’s been working as an MLE for 3-4 years now. Companies want the perceived benefits of ML without investing into it. Their expectation vs reality is different. Obviously all executives think that throwing an LLM backend into a clean UI is sufficient for an AI-powered product, but it’s not. Even a “GPT wrapper” requires significant amount of information retrieval, validation, logging and operational signal collection, etc to not have generic AI slop polluting their product, data, and their image. Even if you don’t train an LLM from scratch (which is what most uninformed executives think ML is), there is significant overhead in solely serving the LLM for your specific use cases. That’s why AI startups, despite being ridiculous and “just a GPT wrapper” still have a legitimate case for a product. Those “other processes” are extremely nontrivial. Most companies are not even willing to invest into a “GPT wrapper”.Now consider something one step further upstream. Let’s say you want to train custom models (not necessarily LLM’s, but SSD’s, classifiers, methods of statistical inference, etc). Maybe you want to power a recommendation system or intelligent search, or you want to automate classification of support issues, etc. This requires ETL pipelines to take raw data and transform them. But this requires your web infrastructure to have instrumentation for real-time analytics and collection of usage behaviors. My point is, delivering machine learning into product is an organizational effort. Starts from the top-down. That’s why the golden data trio of titles: machine learning engineer, data scientist, data engineer, will never be as prevalent as a SWE or analysts in numbers. You could have VERY knowledgeable and talented MLE, DS, DE, but if your org isn’t willing to be data driven from the top-down, these functions will not drive any value, to no fault of these people. A company not collecting data and expecting these functions to succeed is like telling a SWE to build software for a company, but not giving them any servers to deploy on or having no critical infrastructure: CI/CD, networking, security, etc. TLDR; The number of openings for MLE, DS, DE are low because most companies are unwilling to invest into data, and even less willing to invest into ML infra and the upkeep required for industry-specific R&D.",

        "body": "tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive. Summary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues). I believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.The whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company. The first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the \"important\" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew. I made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a \"sink or swim\" mentality. Eventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change. They moved me back into dev in 2024 as a \"last chance.\" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA. I work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect. Several other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they \"aren't interested in being a school\". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).This company is hugely toxic (its one of those \"corporate family\" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change. For what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks. The area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway. To be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues. Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Good luck out there.",

Also, scale is not always just about human users - it’s not hard to imagine an application that has to make hundreds or thousands of calls just to service a single request, that is also a form of scale. Especially in the age of AI agents, this is becoming fairly routine. Alternatively, imagine some cloud storage solution like DropBox which one day might be asked to upload/download a 100 KB file and the next day asked to upload/download a 1 TB file. That is an enormous range of potential payload sizes which itself is another form of scale and brings its own unique challenges.So “scale” comes in many different flavors. But to your specific question, …> are people who have handled scale actually more skilled?… the answer is emphatically “yes”.Anyone can write a basic CRUD app that is functional, where “functional” simply means it doesn’t break. But to optimize an application for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance at large scale? That typically requires years of experience to understand the tradeoffs and foresee bottlenecks before they throttle you.Depending on your subfield, handling traffic at scale may also require not simply writing performant code but also using specialized tooling that you’d have no reason to learn at lower scale.So yes, developing at scale requires significant skills beyond what your run-of-the-mill dev will bring to the table.",

This is typically when you start learning / discovering that the hard part of software is actually the people. Organization, estimating, decision making, long-term direction with short-term milestones that deliver value now and evolve to the full solution.I don't think it's wrong of me to say the programming in my job is easy, since it's how it feels to me. I'm sure many people would see what I code all day and claim it's hard and that's fine too. Disclaimer: Talking about the jobs I've had, I'm sure there are jobs where the programming is new / novel enough for that to be the main difficulty in the day-to-day work, but for me the times I've had to write truly hard code is rare, and almost always as a result of a poor architecture / up front decision. Most of the time the code does feel trivial to me.I've been programming so long that I can't even help new programmers all that much. I can mentor an eager junior or mid level, but my friend who wants to pick up programming and career switch I'm just so far removed from how I had to learn when I was 12 that I can't really empathize and my explanations would probably do more harm than good because I operate at a much higher level by default.",

It’s okay for it to grow organically and naturally at a steady pace without grinding about it. It’s just a job. The notion that you are ruining your career or ruining your future if you’re not constantly trying to uplevel yourself is a bit toxic imo. Plenty of people out there have stable steady jobs.

Work on really selling your career journey and where you want to go and what you're doing to get there. Work more on your communication skills and network more with your community. System Engineer jobs might be a good transition. Good luck!",

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. I imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. From the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. I think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. Another option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. Wish I had even better advise. I think it's universally agreed on that getting the first development job is the hardest. One you land that, it'll still be hard, but maybe not as hard as the first time.",

I work in big tech and make good money, but I do somewhat regret not taking the opportunity when I was younger.If you truly have a passion for games, I would say take the chance. You can always pivot later. Game dev is hard, and I’ve known many game devs who switched to a “normal” swe job later with great success. Going the other way is not as common.

Probably not (unless you're trying to break into game dev).Will it hurt you? Probably not.It *could* tangentially help you by way of building skills you might otherwise not use and strengthening fundamentals like DS&A. Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.But everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.Game dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).TL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it. Edit: and you'll probably get lots of conflicting answers here. Were I interviewing you, I'd be **very** interested in your hypothetical game dev journey because of my own interest. Win some, lose some. It's a shitty market no matter what so find something to just keep you learning but not burned out.",

Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. You have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. Besides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?* NoSQL?* Any cloud experience?* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? * Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?Those are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. While LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. One other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students. Terrible advice gets shared here all the time.The last thing is try not to get too discouraged. The market is rough, and finding a job when you don't have one is always harder.",

While here, I've worked on a wide array of different projects, even though I started in an embedded systems role. Through multiple management decisions, my team and I have worked on many projects outside of our domain, to the point where it looks like I'm completely lying on my resume. When I began, I was working primarily in Android development where I would work in Java and some additional Python scripts for automation. Then I worked on another project where I was mainly doing Python and some PowerShell and Bash scripting. After that, I did Python for a while but got exposed to microservice architecture, and found myself working a whole lot with Docker, RabbitMQ, and various other technologies.Afterwards I pivoted again to a new project which was more web-centric, and found myself developing using Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for our frontend.Another pivot, and I spent quite some time doing Data Science/Analytics for numerous stakeholders; during this time I found myself writing numerous SQL queries, working a lot in Jupyter Notebook in Python, and also dabbling in Machine Learning.My most recent pivot I've been working with Django to build a web service, and again working with microservice architecture, and doing a whole lot of database work again.My transitions have been quite extreme over the last several years, going from embedded systems, to data science/ML, to web development, and so on. I feel the same way in the sense that I don't know if I have much of a specialization either, but it's nice to be able to learn so much!",

There was an open role on their careers page so I applied. The new role is hybrid, but so is my current one, so I don’t mind the setup. It took a few weeks of applying to many places to get a recruiter call request, and then about two months from there to get the offer letter.I worry that recruiters at larger companies might filter you out early on if they can’t easily map your experience to their open roles. If you have the chance to transfer internally, that might be your best shot.You will most likely need to work on-site in some capacity. You might have to build toward a role that aligns with your interests. This is my third position, and the first that actually aligns with mine.

Research and apply to every internship you can find; I've noticed there isn't a huge internship grind among comp sci students. Building those connections and gaining experience is huge to finding a job. Also, have a wider view of your career expectations. There is a lot of work that doesn't fit the typical mold like service desk or support analyst jobs but can really help you connect with stakeholders and build management experience. In line with that and as general advice, make yourself flexible and don't feel like you can only focus on one aspect of the field.

There might be those who join and find a job, which is great!

An unhappy person could really ruin this for people trying to help or people trying to get their foot in the door.Would love to see this fleshed out more, I would love to volunteer my time in a more lead/manager position since that is something I'd be interested in exploring as a full time IC as well, especially since I have experience with mentorship.",

Every interviewer is different, but I'd like to think your current answer isn't a single deal-breaker, but maybe one issue among several. We can debate if you want people who are more well-rounded individuals with better work-life balance vs people who are more \"passionate\" about work, but it ultimately boils down to who is interviewing you. It doesn't matter what some online collective decides. It might also just be case that another candidate came off looking better for whatever reason. From a human perspective, it's great that you have balance, etc. But from a work perspective, there are likely people who will prefer someone who may bring more work value. I cringe a bit as I type that, but hopefully you get my point. A person's personality and values can certainly improve and add value to a company, but I was recently in some crunch mode on a project, and a few new devs decided they wanted work-life balance. It's good for them to set boundaries, but it can also make things more difficult. I'm trying to balance doing what's right vs what is sometimes practical.",

If you ARE expected to manage him but he's not skilled enough to contribute, just give him some poorly defined busywork like \"make suggestions to improve the UI\" or \"read through the codebase until you feel you understand it\". In the case that he eventually asks for more substantive things to do, just give him the smallest thing that your team needs done that's hard to mess up.

We can’t honestly recommend someone to our manager who can’t problem solve or code through a short problem without AI assistance/google. And then there’s a good chunk of candidates that are just obviously cheating and even some not obvious but our tools picked up so those are instant no call backs.

Learn to read documentation, implement side projects that interest you, and dig into the frameworks you use and their docs. Learn foundational stuff like how the request response cycle works, how web frameworks are structured, etc. Maybe find an online course that walks you through learning/implementing stuff/projects/frameworks.Edit: and learn to debug properly!

Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn. If you are serious about wanting to become a better engineer and focus on that, in time you will.",

Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads. ##what does that mean for you?QA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. ##ExamplesLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. For ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry. A lot will even take non-students (helping Columbia with their research actually landed me at Microsoft without an application)Wanna do QA? Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles. Don't even gotta apply just start and get paid like uber. ##Bottom lineIt's very doable, it's just not as \"easy\" as it was before. And believe it or not, most people for most well paid industries have to do this exact same thing.Edit: assuming you are willing to move to a tech hub... or at least apply to jobs with a address / PO box in a tech hub",

I write a resume that effectively communicates my experience in a very concise way meant to pull the reader in. I've never thought about keywords, I've never thought about metrics/impact/numbers, I've never thought about AI or ATS.A good resume is a good resume.If you're not getting bites, you should be focusing on what's wrong with your resume, not how to get past \"filters\".SWE resume writing is actually a pretty well defined task. Our resumes are *technical documents*. And how to write a technical document is a full on field of study called Tech Comm. Many CS degrees have several tech comm courses in them. If you study what makes a good resume, by studying Tech Comm and what makes a good technical document, the interviews will follow. That's something that a lot of people overlook. And the rules of tech comm would *never* suggest you keyword spam to get around some AI.So that's my advice. Learn what makes a resume good (without asking others for anecdotal advice). Don't operate on the assumption that your resume is already good and focus on trying to find some sort of other problem outside your control like AI or other resume filters.",

The minute you google \"Resume\" you're going to get thousands of subjective opinions that all conflict with each other, and that are all convinced they're right.You can't really take *anybody's* advice on a \"resume\".But Tech Comm, and what makes a good Technical Document, is like I said, a *field of study*. It's extremely cut and dry and objective. You can major in it in college. A good place to start might straight up be auditing an online college course for free about tech comm. All my tech comm knowledge came from the classes I took in college about it.Using the stuff you learn from that, apply those same rules to your resume.What makes a good technical document, makes a good resume.",

Nine years of development work has given you problem-solving skills, debugging expertise, and the ability to work with legacy systems that many companies desperately need. The fact that you've built end-to-end applications shows you understand the full development lifecycle, which is valuable even if you haven't dealt with massive scale. Desktop applications often involve complex business logic and performance considerations that translate well to other domains.The key is reframing your story during interviews. Focus on the technical challenges you've solved, the business impact of your work, and your ability to learn new technologies quickly. When system design questions come up, be upfront about your experience level but walk through your thought process methodically. Companies often care more about how you think through problems than whether you've personally managed a million-user system. For tricky technical questions like these, use [interview helper AI](http://interviews.chat) to practice different scenarios and get real-time guidance on how to structure your responses - I'm on the team that built it and it's been helpful for navigating those challenging system design discussions that can make or break senior-level interviews.",

If anything you should want to transfer to computer engineering.You should note that certificates are not certifications. Certificates are what you get when you finish random online tutorials. Certifications are from (paid) accredited institutions that (thanks to marketing) signal to employers you have a baseline knowledge of what you're applying for. As a college student, your best chance is through an internship. Cybersecurity jobs, at least the fun ones, are harder and much more scarce than SWE roles. Most companies do not need in-house cybersecurity roles, let alone of the offensive kind. It's definitely not something you'd do instead of SWE if you just want money. The ROI is much less.Also, for a lot of certifications, they are priced with the intention that people's employers will pay for them. I've done an internship in a company that would spend >$2500 per course, per person, not even counting travel to workshops/conferences and in-person exams. Definitely not something a student should be trying to fund themselves.Try CMU's free website:[pwn.college](http://pwn.college)",

You probably won't be able to do it in 15 minutes the first time, but you can get there. Start by understanding the problem and thinking about a high level approach. Which data structures should you use and what algorithm will you use to process your data? Think of the space and time complexity and consider if you can improve that. It helps to write little notes. Only start coding *after* you have your entire solution mapped out. This process can help you identify any utility functions that you can stub out which will help prevent getting confused in a deeply nested loop. This is how I practiced with LC, and I was able to finish all of my technicals with time to spare. I even had time to walk through the solution while writing down and updating the values for my variables and catch some bugs. This part is important for FAANG interviews and will likely get you a hire/strong hire decision. You can get there with some good practice. You need to practice the correct way though.",

My guess is most people are similar to varying degrees. I think the key is enough practice that you don’t have to think too deeply about a problem on the spot. A perfect interview looks like a professor answering questions from students about a complex topic, the professor isn’t thinking through the topic in the moment, only explaining based on his previous understanding. Have enough practice to recognize the patterns and know the answers more intuitively and you shouldn’t have to go as deep into thought where you lose your ability to talk through it. That said, I’m only at that level for certain topics.",

However, as I have been an interviewer myself, I know how unproductive this is and the impression this gives. I will therefore tell the interviewer directly: \"I prefer thinking in silence, but I will still do my best to give you an insight into my thought process\". This helps me because I can now take a silence break whenever I feel like it without feeling bad about it. It helps the interviewer know what's going on because I have explicitly communicated it. Other than that, I believe a mindset shift is due here. Let me offer it: interviewer usually wants you to succeed. We want to get a new colleague and stop the interviews and just get back to our day to day job. Very rarely people will use the interview process to bully you and nitpick. And if they do, this is not a place I want to work at. I mean this. I have experienced this, laughed back at the interviewer and hung up the conversation after saying \"thanks, this was enough information for me\". So, the more you communicate with the interviewer (who wants you to succeed), the more they will be able to help you out, throw you a bone here and there if you're struggling or outright tell you \"this is not what I am looking for\". When you start believing this person wants to help you, you'll naturally want to use this leverage. Definitely use it. A final piece of advice would be to ask a lot of questions yourself. Intelligent, directional, intentional questions. This gives you a lot more information to work with, which makes you more confident in what you're doing, which makes you calm down and be able to communicate. It additionally allows you to showcase your maturity while being on the \"offense\", so even if you have some hiccups during the coding, you give yourself better chances. Hope this helps!Feel free to DM me as well, if you wanna chat more about it",

        "body": "Data science is hard to break into without a masters or PhD and several years of experience in a data science role, so an offer for a data science role early in your career offers to jump start that process and makes future options easier and salary negotiations easier. If you’re at all interested in Data Science I would strongly consider that offer. If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn’t really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. I wouldn’t consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You’re trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. That leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won’t build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it’s not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don’t build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. Id consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn’t feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn’t take the internship unless there’s a serious upside on the other side of it. Don’t take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it’s easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you’re weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It’s hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",

As difficult as it sounds, a lot of these math courses are setting you up for more technical courses in CS, and without them, it's gonna be a bit difficult (flashback to taking a data mining course before taking Calc 3). I also want to iterate that what it sounds like they probably diluted the course load for CS to entice more students, and in which case I'd recommend sticking with computer engineering, not because it's harder, but you'd gain more from it. That being said, even I think that harder courses does not equate to more and you should still take up the recommendations here. There's a post 4-5 years ago that I think is on the Wiki now that details what you should be doing as a CS student and how to prepare for it.",

There’s SWE’s who work on infra, but that is generally not the same as people who only deal with infra. Infra SWEs usually write code for the platform to serve applications to utilize the infra, or they write custom CI/CD or maintenance logic (usually for large corps that use their own infra). At most places I’ve heard of, “cloud engineer” is closer to DevOps (instead of Jenkins or Circle CI, they would be dealing with cloud-native Kubernetes, Terraform, other types of cloud compute, etc) than it is a development role.

I would try to look for opportunities to get involved in decision-making for the architecture involved in the infra at your company you will be interning at, it would be a really good opportunity to see how distributed systems work in real-time. Try to do something beyond just making configuration file changes or monitoring activity. It’s unique for new grads to be able to have this type of insight into working services and software.",
