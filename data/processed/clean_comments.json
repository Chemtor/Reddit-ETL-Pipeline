So \"just looking for confirmation from somewhere\"? That's called fishing. You got hooked on this half assed idea and didn't want to bother with real due diligence. Why is a question only you can answer.Never EVER drop a table unless you have complete human sign-off. This is pretty basic engineering principles: if you do it wrong, dropping is obviously the highest cost database operation. Not just financial cost but mental, as you learned. That means timing and communication matter a lot more than for general querying. Thinking through that ahead of time is one of the major differences between analysts and engineers.In conclusion, you should feel badly enough to never do anything remotely similar.

Fixing bugs in SQL logic2. Adding columns as requestedBut again, never rename tables or columns unless you know what you are doing because downstream data pipelines, dashboards, integrations all expect specific names.Best of luck!

If you get pushback, point out that your team is always delivering late, so clearly everyone is \\*under\\*-estimating and you are trying to be realistic. 2. If you are not influential on your team, discuss with someone who is and work a plan. Come with some ideas for solutions rather than just complaints and figure out how to present them. e.g. switch to a Kanban-style workflow; keep the backlog groomed and in prioritized order; for tickets with firm deadlines find a way to indicate the deadline so it gets prioritized correctly. Each person works on only one active story at a time until it is in a review stage where they are waiting on approval to merge. Only then do they pick up the next story on the backlog assigned to them.This gives a clarity to bottlenecks, and focus to what is in progress as it is limited at any given time. It forces clear prioritization of the work each person needs to do next: if a new urgent task comes in, it's set appropriately at or near the top of the backlog. Other items naturally shift down.It does require constant grooming & prioritization, and attention to velocity to ensure the lack of sprint deadline does not cause people to slack off. In addition to that, you can start the week off with everyone stating their goal(s) for the week based on what they know right then. ( in a shared document) \\- As the week progresses, each person jots a quick note here or there on anything that prevent completion, whether changing priorities, lack of information needed from others, blocking issues, etc. Or you check off the stuff you have completed in some way. \\- At end of week, status is left as it is; the next week a new section is created for that week, and you don't go back and clean up the previous week's notes or ticket status.Over time you can read back and see the patterns of *why* work is typically underestimated.",

It's even worse if you want to do long term planning - we can plan in general (for example building new DWH), but it's impossible to plan timeline.

Of course several of those only have RO support IIRC because of the clusterfuck that is catalogs – so maybe there's hope for them picking this up just because RW support will be more straightforward to implement.Either way, interested to see where this is going – perhaps the data lake format wars aren't done just yet.",

I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.My super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data \"inside\" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.For me, this has shifted the way I view what a \"database\" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with \"database\" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says \"to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB\" or \"Added Row X, Deleted Row Y\" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a \"delete file\", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.My understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)Moreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",

Iceberg and Delta are fundamentally metadata formats, you write a bunch of files that basically say \"table X is comprised of parquet files 1,2,...N, minus the rows at positions 1,2,...N\". But then they put a catalog on top, which is a regular relational database that says \"the latest version of table X is defined by metadata file X.N\". If we're going to have a database in the picture, why don't we just put all the metadata there?The problem I see is, I don't see how this gets adopted. Adoption of Iceberg was a multi-year process. Adoption of Delta was basically vendor-driven by Databricks and Microsoft. Right now I can't see a path by which DuckLake gets adopted by Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, MS Fabric, and AWS Glue.

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models. All that said, when it comes to raw ingestion, python notebooks or dlt pipelines are still the way to go. I don’t have any experience with snowflake, so can’t help you there!",

Expect stuff like \"how would you model this entity relationship\" or \"write a query that joins these tables and does X aggregation\" 2. System design - you'll get asked to design a batch/streaming pipeline for some scenario. Know your Kafka vs Kinesis, star schema vs snowflake, batch vs micro-batch trade-offs.3. Take-home - these suck but common. Usually building a small ETL pipeline with test data. I had one where I had to build a pipeline that transformed reddit comments into a star schema and ran some basic analyses.4. Behavioral - standard stuff but focus on data quality, testing, and how you've handled data issues.Best advice: brush up on SQL window functions and Python data structures. Also be ready to talk about data quality - every company is obsessed with this right now. I've interviewed \\~25 DE candidates this quarter and most fail on basic stuff like explaining partitioning strategies or handling late-arriving data.",

This was a much better format at real tech companies and a MUCH MUCH worse format at wannabe tech companies, they were very \"magic word\" centric.3. Multiple panel interviews, at least one behavioral. Similar experience above, tech companies and dinosaur boomer corps were much more fluid and conversational. \"Tech\" companies were once again an awful experience. I failed a 5th round team matching interview because I mentioned DB2 literally one time. Got a rejection saying they were looking for someone with more experience.

The Elastic License in fusion blocks hosting competitors and could be interpreted as discouraging anyone from extending the tool. For example, if a company like Altimate tried to build a dbt Power User extension using dbt Fusion, or if someone modified fusion to get around rent-seeking restrictions set by dbt Labs, those efforts could be seen as competition and could result in account suspensions or bans, if not legal action.2. The requirement to authenticate in the VS Code extension, along with its acceptable use policy, seems aimed at identifying medium- and large-sized organizations using the free tools and pushing them toward buying a cloud license.This isn’t just about drawing a line between core and cloud — it looks like an intentional effort to murder core without causing too much backlash. People have already noticed that development on core has slowed down significantly over the past year. At this rate, it wouldn’t be surprising if core quietly disappears in the next few years since it will inevitably be a challenge/infeasible to maintain both moving forward.",

A few things: 1. dbt-core is not going away! Have you seen the [dbt Core roadmap we published yesterday](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/docs/roadmap/2025-05-new-engine-same-language.md)? It talks about our plans to continue supporting and adding functionality to dbt Core. 2. Totally understand having some questions about the ELv2 License. [You can read more here](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine), but the gist of it is as you can adopt it, use it, share it, modify it, all without talking to us or registering at all. The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future. You can check out [this post for more details](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components), but I'd be really curious to hear what's on your mind!",

If you want to 1000 lines of raw SQL (no Jinja templating), you absolutely can. dbt will submit the query to the configured warehouse. If you really need every ounce of performance, write the giant query, but you can generally make pipelines much easier to read and maintain while getting acceptable performance.My bigger issue with dbt is the invocation / scheduling overhead that can be difficult to see and extremely impactful on performance. My team uses Airflow and k8s, and we've had to refine guidelines on building DAGs a lot. Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline. We ended up consolidating models into a small handful of tasks, which reduced runtime by 25%.",

On a brighter note from Stored Proc -> dbt it is far easier to understand where the bottlenecks are at and can then appropriately. Perhaps some models need to be consolidated or perhaps they are doing full loads where incremental could be done.",

I don’t entirely disagree with you, but I do disagree with you in many cases that exist. I believe this is why complex ETL tooling does transformations in an application layer versus how ELT focuses on the database layer. Having managed and dealt with fully driven sql ETL solutions, one can see the performance benefits and the performance pain points. Separating those concerns between db and app helps to determine what type of tool you need. I’m generally dealing with a significant volume of transformation and mapping logic, to consume a hundred different pictures of sources routing to the same final destinations. This part has never done well in sql server, and we won’t even get in to the concerns on flexibility, scalability, and bloat, to use sql server for this particular piece of the paradigm, if it is a concern you are even battling. If not, I’d argue in favor of something basic, and full sql can be totally fine in this regard. But if you are some enterprise level organization in some field of work with lots of data interchange and very little in the way of rules to enforce contracts, your transformation part of ETL will become king.",

It's rare for them to need data within 10 seconds, but 5-30 minutes is common - so that they aren't waiting around for data they just updated to be reflected. * How quickly do the engineers need it to run in? Keep in mind that if a production process fails on the last step, and if you can't restart from the last step then an 8-hour process might now take 16 hours. What if it then fails *again*? And what if this is going on during a holiday, or the middle of the night when it's hard to get expertise to help? For these reasons I push back hard on any process than takes more than 60 minutes to run, and strongly prefer incremental jobs than can run in 5 minutes.",

For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",

Iceberg (and S3 Tables) won't change that fundamental math problem)I STILL LOVE ICEBERG, but this Iceberg-for-everything AND S3-Tables-fixes-everything vision does not pass the sniff test. It \\*\\*might\\*\\* work, but it sure doesn't smell good at first sniff. Let us know how it goes!",

As far as possible, why not?Are we sacrificing depth for breadth? That's silly, you're not a PhD researcher, you're a data plumber. Just plumb stuff together.Is this expectation more common? You're assigning a huge importance to something one person - likely a non-technical manager - told you, ignoring the fact this person's job is to increase the ROI of hiring you.Is being full-stack really an advantage? I readily accept most new responsibilities, and my career has tremendously benefited from it. You do you, some people just want a clear, stable scope and don't mind not climbing the ladder, or have already done so.I'm skeptical of this whole idea that there are \"growing expectations\" on DEs. Who's expecting? Are these people in the room right now? This is such a one-sided, uncreative way of framing the behavior of interested parties.Management and biz are obliged to wish for everything they can wish for, it's their job. If you could work for 10 people and substitute a huge, costly team, they'd love that. You're supposed to know this is what the incentives in place lead people to daydream about, and don't give it much thought. I'm sure you and most DEs have professional wet dreams of our own, that you know are not in any CEO's best interest and that they're also not supposed to worry about it.The only relevant question is: is there a Nash equilibrium in the DE job market in which most companies have overworked DEs wearing 5 hats at a time? Sounds silly when you say it out loud, doesn't it?",

Yeah, if you make it more complex than a super simple app, you should design it carefully. That's not a unique concept to Streamlit but people still write blog posts acting shocked when packing 2k lines of code in a single file without a thought for state management doesn't scale the way they want it to.The argument in this article that custom components are a mess is BS. Go look at the code for most of the custom components that exist. Most of them are the simplest react wrappers you could imagine, plus a normal developer using streamlit doesn't even have to worry about any of that. Not once have I ever had to get into debugging anything besides python when working with streamlit (even when using custom components, which is absolutely not required) so why would the fact of how they are built even matter to the average joe using streamlit?Compare what you can do in a single file with a few lines of code in Streamlit vs what the equivalent would be in asp.net or react.

It's easy and any DE team should be able to do it without much hassle.* In my previous job (small shop, leading a small team), I considered implementing dbt for a couple of years before actually doing it and absolutely regret the wait.

I don't think the cloud offering is always a huge gain, but it helped some of the less technical people on the team run processes in testing more easily. We also gained a bunch from mesh, since we had a few projects (eg one for silver and one for gold models). The explorer feature was also nice to have, but wouldn't be a deciding factor. Overall, things like macros, tests, Jinja, etc, were also fine. You could find other ways to do them in other frameworks, but they're useful in many ways and you can implement a lot without much lift.",

Before it was spaghetti SQL files with no clear dependencies. Most useful features: ref(), tests, and documentation are actually worth it. Sources and macros are heavily used. Exposures were nice in theory but nobody maintained them. Snapshots were a mess - ended up just building those in our warehouse directly.Orchestration: Airflow + dbt is still clunky. We have our dbt DAG inside Airflow but then need to manually sync when dependencies change. If I started today, I'd use Dagster since it has first-class dbt integration.For non-technical folks: The lineage graphs in dbt Cloud are nice but rarely used by stakeholders in my experience. They still just message the data team.Challenges: The learning curve for non-SQL people is steep, especially with macros and Jinja. Performance became a bottleneck with 500+ models. dbt Cloud's git workflow is rigid compared to local dev.Would I adopt again? Yes, but with caveats. I'd set much stricter conventions up front and would consider something like preswald for the Python+SQL parts since our ML engineers hate the dbt workflow. We use it for a recommender system where we need both pandas for user clustering and SQL for joining with sales data - that cross-language part is where dbt falls short.",

The most impactful changes I've seen are around collaboration and code quality - `ref()` functions eliminated our hard coded table names, builtin testing catches data quality issues early, and version control became natural. The documentation generation and lineage tracking have improved our communication, though the semantic layer features are still maturing and often feel overhyped.The real challenges I've encountered emerge around orchestration and performance at scale. While dbt handles transformation DAGs elegantly, integrating with Airflow required planning to avoid duplicate logic and scheduling conflicts. For managing data from multiple sources, I've found that solutions like Windsor.ai simplify the upstream, consolidating data from various APIs and platforms.Given your junior team's situation, I'd recommend starting with dbt Cloud despite the cost, the GUI, builtin scheduler, and easier onboarding reduce the learning curve compared to Core's CLI-heavy workflow. SQLMesh is promising but still early stage, most teams I know would adopt dbt again, but with better upfront planning around testing strategies, macro organization, and clear governance policies.",

Sure you can make your own framework, use stored procs, spark, etc, but in the end you will be the only one using that vs the thousands of orgs already using dbt.I don't see many people using dbt features that were not there like in version 1.0 or 1.5. For example, not many people using versioned models, unit testing, etc.What people do use; docs, lineage, data testing, and the bread and butter of dbt; snapshots, incremental models, etc.All this being said, dbt alone isn't gonna fix anything. The teams that realize the best outcomes change more than the tech. They add things like CI/CD, implementing tools like SQLFluff, dbt-checkpoint, etc. They rethink the whole process not just adding dbt. You also need to worry about improving how data is modeled, because that will have a big impact as well.Many people do use Airflow with dbt including people on dbt Cloud. Why? because the dbt Cloud scheduler is pretty limited. Airflow is the market leader hands down.I have seen large teams work with dbt well and I have seen small teams work with it poorly. Sometimes this is due to their philosophical differences. e.g. not letting dbt manage the dependencies but trying to manually recreate them in Airflow. As for dbt Cloud pricing, it can be an issue as teams grow. Their teams level is limited to one project and up to 8 users, so that becomes an issue when teams pass those limits because prices jump quite high.Google \"dbt alternatives\" or \"dbt cloud vs dbt Core\", lots of resources out there. This week there has been a lot of chatter about dbt Fusion, but if is not feature complete yet IMO and very Snowflake centric. The licensing restrictions will mean many people won't adopt it any time soon. Would I use it today, probably, there is a wealth of information out there on dbt, a big community, a large ecosystem, but I would also consider other options like SQLMesh which has a more open licensing model and even their VS Code extension is better than dbt's because that one requires registering with dbt cloud and it is limited to 15 users.",

For example, I was expecting to use airflow, bigquery, redshift, or dbt. But I ended up using Apache NiFi and some other less known resources. Sometimes companies don’t have the infrastructure or budget for the popular tools. So you’ll need to work with what you got and slowly integrate when you can.",

Sometimes, the best practice/approach to be taken in a certain situation, is the most obvious/simple one.For instance: Let’s say that you can build a simple stored procedure on pure SQL that solves a problem or creates a temporary dataset of some kind - Sometimes this would be much better than wasting dozens of hours creating a python pipeline that would take 2/3 times more compute/resources, and would end up by delivering almost the same performance, sometimes would even run slower.All I’m saying is that sometimes we focus too much on the tech outlook of the thing, when what we should be doing was to be thinking on the simplest way to solve the presented problem.",

To me, it's been steep in terms of the sheer amount of new things to learn, but it can be taken step by step. I just started a role as an analytics engineer.

Nobody is monitoring uptime or performance because that’s the vendor’s job - and they aren’t doing it either. Meanwhile it’s expensive for terrible performance and management are constantly staring at it as a cost and trying to get everyone to plan and justify their usage and keep justifying it; which kills both development and later experimentation and just sucks your will to live. Compare to on-premises. Fast. Probably over provisioned and under utilised. But it’s already paid for so you can develop straight away without having to estimate what it’s all going to cost, experiment and have it go wrong without getting a sudden million dollar bill, it’s so much easier to get access or even a couple VMs spun up with admin access, and you can get what you need done. Not every place is like that. But a lot of big ones are.Cloud isn’t what was sold to developers a decade ago. It probably could be, but it isn’t. Companies only get bigger and big companies only get more bureaucratic. What can you do.",

        "body": "I left working at companies that did on-prem largely because of the hassle around buying new servers when the business wanted my team to deliver more data products with the same hardware. I’m not saying this is all companies, but it was my experience early on and have since enjoyed working in cloud settings.What you are describing sounds more like poorly architected cloud platforms versus an issue with cloud computing. The same could be said for an on-prem company where there isn’t a reliable IT team for managing the servers. I never experienced it but you hear about the meme posts of “unpatched servers” so I doubt those are “reliable and performant”Both on-prem and cloud are susceptible to poor architecture, lack of resources with unrealistic demand for budget, lack of in house knowledge, etc. At the end of the day, the tools themselves matter far less and instead require in-depth understanding of trade offs to know what is the right architecture for different use cases.Lastly, on-prem and cloud both have a place in building Data Platforms. Baffles me why “for on-prem to be good, cloud has to be bad” and vice versa",

This flexibility comes at a price though, even if you are using a low-level unmanaged “serverfull” infrastructure and in the long run having an on-prem setup is cheaper, depending on how mature your team is.Following a product curve, when you reach product maturity you don’t have the need to scale as quick as you think you need.Economic factors also come into play when buying servers today is not the same as buying servers 15 years ago, everything is faster and depending on what you need, cheaper too! There is also the cloud service market saturation too.Don’t know much about Apache NiFi infrastructure needs but I don’t think that going public cloud or on-prem has anything to do with a certain technology/framework, there is so much more at stake here, business-wise. It should be decision driven by business context and growth strategy rather than any technology.",

Anything non - software really.In all of these situations the firm doesn't want or doesn't care to build the expertise you need to manage an on premise data center. Not only do they not have the budget allocated to hire full time permanent IT staff, they usually don't have managers skilled in building or maintaining technology infrastructure teams. They also usually don't have the culture required to do site reliability properly. Imagine at Bank XYZ you ask for a new server. You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left. Or in hardware companies you often have tons of people who can CAD, but a handful who can code. You're only thinking from the perspective of the TECHNOLOGY. It's not about the TECH. It's about the ORGANIZATION. They don't WANT to be TECH companies. They can't recruit developers, they can't retain developers, they can't manage developers, they don't have code quality standards, the limited devs they have are swamped with managing legacy infrastructure that sucks because it was built on top of technical debt and needs to be refreshed.Now, if AWS or Google or Azure come along and say, \"hey you can store 300Gb in object storage for $30/month and we handle patching/security etc.\" do you think anyone in these companies would say no? If you're the only data engineer in company ABC that makes widgets for robots, do you think you'd say \"actually let me configure an on premise data center all by myself, configure all the users, and install Ni-Fi and also let me patch it and renew certs and everything else all by myself, and when my boss yells at me to take shortcuts to please people that don't understand software I'll tell them no\" Do you really think that will fly? Who do you think wins the political battle here? Experienced data engineers aren't thinking about just the tech. They're thinking about the CONTEXT they are working with. Bank operations are about securing lending and loans, personal data, etc., managing risk; IT just facilitates that. So naturally, a cloud vendor flush with cash offering to take some of that risk is a nice feature. Hardware companies want to make quality parts and components at lower prices. If someone says \"hey you can set up your robot telemetry log using AWS IoT offerings..\" what would you do?",

The lineage tracking is solid and deployment is way less painful than Airflow. For your text processing case, I've used it to run spaCy pipelines on product reviews that feed into Postgres - works great because you define everything as assets and Dagster handles the dependency resolution.If you're looking for something more lightweight, preswald might work too - it's open-source and handles the Python + SQL combo well. I use it for our NLP pipelines where we extract entities from news articles, transform with Python, then load to Postgres. You can build the lineage visually and it handles versioning through git. Much simpler setup than the Airflow/dbt combo we had before that required two separate systems for the sql vs python parts.",

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can’t be generated, that would be counted as downtime.Hope this helps. Evaluating the success of a Data Engineering team can be tricky because there is a lot out of our control so whether it is fair or not, we have to play what I call “a lot of defensive” to ensure we are in a good state. But once you get the above 3 down, you can then maybe target something like how fast you can “onboard a new feature”.",

If you are more into actual computer science - IT and solving problem **about** data the data engineering might be more up your alley. If it helps usually a DE is upstream from a DS. So technically the DS is kind of the DE's client so to speak. There is overlap and collaboration but the DE sets up the data so that the DS can then use that data. Not sure about how the job market compares but I think it's safe to say that both aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Good luck!",

One thing to consider is where you live which has ultimately driven my choice to go into data engineering. Here in Australia, we just don’t have enough businesses that are willing and ready to bring on data scientists to model there data, curate it or do any further analysis with the data as such yet. So data engineering has always had more opportunity as business are looking to move their data into cloud systems, just not ready for various reasons yet to go further with the data. The same is for data governance roles and perhaps even devOps, here at least most businesses are looking to hire experienced individuals who are willing to take on that particular role. I could be wrong here but this has been my analysis from friends who are senior data engineers in big corporate companies. Now that I have my masters in data science, I’ve gone ahead and done my azure data fundamentals, data bricks lake house certification as well as data bricks associate data engineering certification to make me ready for any graduate positions",

Whether the insight from data requires a dedicated DS team or DA/BI, that's the question. DS is more interesting for sure but in a corporate environment you are always going to struggle to enjoy it. It really depends on how much faith company puts in a DS team.DS generally has a lot of uncertainty and requires lot of justification to exist in a company. There are some fields like marketing and adtech where DS have more defined problems to solve. Otherwise lot of the times you are struggling to have quality data to provide business value that some DA/BI team can't already. Lot of DS roles these days have merged with ML engineer role. So I would say make a choice between DE or ML engineer. In general closer you are you to the engineering team in the company, safer your job would be. With DS that's not always the case.",

If you tell me your schema I can give you an example of how to set up the table.In ClickHouse when you make a table it must have an ORDER BY clause (this is a different concept than the order by your queries).In general what you want to do is set the ORDER BY on the table to all the fields you will end up using in your queries, but list them in order of lowest cardinality first. This will let ClickHouse run your queries in literally milliseconds.e.g. suppose you have logs that have the columns: id (unique), timestamp, app, machine, country, message. Where each app runs on many machines and each machine is in a country.Here you want to set the ORDER BY such that the lowest cardinality items come first. Since you have few distinct countries, more distinct machines, many distinct apps and very many distinct timestamps it should be:ORDER BY (country, machine, app, timestamp)This will store the data sorted on disk in a way that will make GROUP BYs very efficient. You can expect queries of under 1 second on an 8 core machine.However also note that ClickHouse is very fast. Even if you don’t set the group by optimally it will likely still execute your queries in under 1min.Whilst it’s hard to give exact numbers I’ve given ballparks for what you can expect for illustration to help you decide whether you want to do it or not.Edit: another thing to note is that ClickHouse will compress your data to speed it up and use less disk. With the correct schema you can likely store 1tb in a few hundred gbs. If you post your schema I can help.",

Yes this is basically misleading but if you're able to speak intelligently to basic cloud services during the interviews and are able to pick things up quickly it likely doesn't matter. Option 2: read up on and test out as many DE related cloud technologies as you can so you can upfront say \"I haven't worked in cloud but have done personal projects and understand the technologies listed in the job description fit, and I'm confident I can contribute meaningfully in a month or less in those technologies if you hire me.\" I went this route in my onprem to cloud role transition. Regardless of the option, remember that hiring managers aren't looking for xyz skills per se, they're wanting to know if you can do the job. You're not gonna convince every single one that you can do it without prior work experience but for those you can, full confidence goes a long way.",

We only did PoCs with ClickHouse and Starrocks - I'd say those are kind of \"second generation real-time OLAP\" where Druid and Pinot are first generation. The difference between the \"generations\" seems to be mostly operational, and also ClickHouse and Starrocks can also do data transformation, while Pinot and Druid seem to expect the data goes out mostly in the same form as it goes in.The data transformation is also the key challenge, as for the data to be transformed you have to translate the logic into materialized views, which have some limitations. If you're mostly \"adding data to a pile\" with some aggregations and small joins, that can be done relatively easily. If you have multi-layer data warehouse style model with complex logic, it might get complicated, and that is where we got stuck.",

There's other views after that but the point is to store unstructured, then structure on read. You can do stuff like materialised views if you need more performant reads. The benefit of this approach is your ETL doesn't break if the object contents change, and you can always just change the views to reflect evolving schema. It's also very easy to build, and I'm big on simple, managed solutions because engineer time is expensive and niche solutions are a headache to reverse engineer.",

My organisation decided against a delta lake in favor of a easier to maintain (allegedly) Snowflake warehouse. The consultants sold them on the idea, so it must be true.",

I know Salesforce in particular rate limits their APIs which can make it difficult to export large amounts of data (they don’t want you doing this, essentially) so that could be the reason. A properly designed & implemented CDC system shouldn’t have “data quality” issues like those that you’ve mentioned. But could it be that deletes are handled a different way? For example, if SCD type 2 is implemented in Snowflake, you’d never delete records entirely, you’d instead end-date them and insert a new row. Hope that helps!",

Its usually given to folks with some DE experience.As a DE Intern, I have always asked for more work, wanted to learn and get my hands dirty. Here are some things I wish the company could have done / Internships in DE should be like1. Rotation: I feel DE is broad, you have members handling your K8s, Analytics Engineers, EDH teams etc... I think the internship should offer the candidates a feel of each role. This way I feel, they will get more insights about the entire flow on a prod level. Like how teams are handling the companies data needs etc..2. Reward : You will always find someone who shows more interest and passion towards DE than the others, reward them, meaning, additional responsibilities like leading a group of interns to build end-to-end pipelines, let them figure out.3. Coupons for Professional certifications as a reward (maybe?)",

The entire experience was so overwhelming and almost everything I learned was about conflict& expectations management rather than DE, I think interns should be given clear instructions and not be included in internal drama.On a side note will your program be open to accepting interns remotely ?

We don’t have a specific rotation plan. Since we’re a consulting firm people tend to naturally rotate projects, and interns follow that once they convert into full time employees (usually happens after around 1 year of internship — in my country internship contracts can last up to 2 years, and at my company we aim to convert interns into FTEs, we don’t hire juniors, they come exclusively from the internship program). The way our program is structured is around 6 months for the learning plan (since they are undergrad students we don’t expect/require previous experience or extensive knowledge) and the remaining internship period (this can change from intern to intern based on their needs/progress) is spent allocated on project (usually the same one).We don’t have any official rewards system, but as a team our approach it to give the interns opportunities to explore according to their development and interests. Things like interns joining POCs, internal projects, etc. We have a dedicated budget for the internship programs, so any courses/certifications they take are covered by that and we provide access to the O’Reily learning portal. These are not rewards though, they are part of the internship program.",

If you have to get \"everything\" our solution (though architecture and tooling is different specifically not using redshift) was delta loads for ingestion -> incremental persistent table (dbt model) (we use a variant column (snowflake) to persist a historical record of the raw data still in its semi structured format) -> then we flatten the arrays into operational tables (e.g. event params or user events) which are also incremental models (we generate a custom unique key here based on array data) ( in snowflake we cluster based on the keys that make up the operational key to improve efficiency) and we use the delete+merge snowflake strategy (this is well documented and can be replicated in other tooling, snowflake just makes it easier and cans the feature OOB).Most of our compute is snowflake for these cases and for a persistent historical BQ object of ~10b rows (semi-structured), in terms of dbt, we can run most of our models in 5-30 mins (each) depending on the array size and if we scale the Snowflake WH.Obviously if your GA4 has a bit more customization, and your traffic is significantly larger than my end users, your experience can differ but we feel this is a solid and scalable approach. A bigger risk point is if the delete+merge strategy fails during the run you could see data loss, but that's fairly unlikely and also why we have a redundant backup.",

A lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data. The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",

If you let business users run SQL you are significantly increasing the risk.If you are determined to go down this route then I would ensure that the data model presented to users is as simple as possible with limited opportunities for users to make things up for themselves - so this probably means creating views that pre-join your tables and where all calculations are pre-defined, and then only giving users to these views, not the underlying data.I would still limit them to running simple SELECT... WHERE...GROUP BY statements.Out of interest, have you asked your business users whether they want to be able to run their own SQL rather than, for example, using a graphical report builder (BI tool) where they can drag and drop fields onto a report?",

The techs you mentioned are all OSS, which is kind of the opposite, but most of the time when an individual is interviewed, rarely is the interviewer part of the data team, I can’t think of one place I went in on contract where their tech stack was what advertised in jd. Its comes down to one thing ego. Most people in the hiring process don’t want to bring in someone who will think out the box (not necessarily smarter) as it hurts their ego if in the event they maybe wrong. When u look thru job postings you will see some postings that mention baselines techs without every mentioning vendor specific techs, in the states this will be normalized around companies near Cali or Seattle or any other tech hubs.

For a pure notebook feel with SQL superpowers, try DataStation or Querybook (from Pinterest). Dealt with this recently when setting up a data analysis workflow across teams - DBeaver ended up being the most reliable for heavy postgres work, while DataStation was better for mixing SQL+Python for quick viz work. preswald is also worth looking at if you need interactive dashboards/sharing beyond just sql notebooks - lets you write sql/python in the same space and outputs to interactive apps.",

AWS integrations aside, both of their place in a tech stack, but hopefully even Hudi fans can agree it isn’t getting the same support as Iceberg.Edit: Forgot to mention the newly released DuckLake. I haven’t had time to dig into it yet but it does sound like at a quick glance that it solves some of the challenges with other formats.",

I use upsert sort of loosely here because if you have append only, then you can simply create a temp table in bigquery with all the staged data, query your existing warehouse for any matches, if there are any matches then you can delete all the matches from your temp table, and then insert whatever is left into the warehouse.",

Concatenate into a single dataframeFrom there you can save the DF directly to your table, or you could save it is as parquet on another bucket where you could ingest into you DW with a copy command.Edit: by the way, I would NOT trigger the jobs with S3 event trigger. You can do if you want, but event-driven architecture is something I always regret. Just use a cron.",

However, with dltHub, looks like it streamlines this quite a bit.And because dltHub is just Python, it fits well into Airflow.I like Dagster because when I was evaluating the local developer experience between it and Airflow, Dagster was better. Also, since I regularly use dbt in projects, Dagster has native support for dbt versus with Airflow, where you need to use Cosmos via Astronomer to do the same (otherwise you dbt models are just a single node). Lastly I conceptually liked its approach to being asset-centric versus workflow-centric. Airflow has recently addressed this in 3.0 but I was doing this evaluation 2 years ago so that wasn't a thing then.That being said, I've never spent much time with Airflow so I don't have strong opinions against Airflow. Airflow is definitely the industry standard and with their 3.0 release, they shored one of their weakness by adding the concept of assets.Lastly, I am by no means saying you should migrate from Airflow -> Dagster. You have Airflow up and running and Dagster is not going to solve your current problems and in fact, migrating would more than likely just create new problems.I think dltHub would be worth looking into. Another option could be Airbyte. That would probably help with some of the challenges you are facing.",

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.Classic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.And that's bad for two reasons:1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source: why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",

Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good. Easy to write, readable, produces efficient apps, easy to deploy, if you don't mind its paradigm and wordiness, you'll generally enjoy using it.",

It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal. However, that comes at a cost, so when you have to venture into things like runtime checks or the `unsafe` package, you get into a deep rabbit hole quickly. For example, working with a large volume of JSON data gets really tricky if you need it fast.",

I don't mean runtime error, this isn't like exceptions that propagate. I mean **no error**. The call seems successful, except you get nulls as a result. Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == \"\", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be \"clean\", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \\* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \\* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \\*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use \"interfaces\" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",

In my company (small indie game development company), we have that thing going, where everyone is supposed to read 1 book about game development or any topic related to it in any way, and then present the book in a short conversation within the team, so that everyone learns the most notable pointers from it.\\-> benefits of doing this: team building, information sharing, learning to be charismatic, learning to analyse, learning to make clean summaries, and obviously everyone learns the good parts without \"wasting\" extra time (\"good\" may be subjective - which again supports the thought of having the books, so everyone that is interested in certain topics can read the related book at any given time without depending on the internet and without requiring to have electronics with + reading on paper can be mind soothing, nicely outside in the garden or nature or a quiet room or such)Even if some books offer not much knowledge for us anymore, it is important to see other peoples view on the topics to not get stuck in a tunnel vision of knowledge. Every book that offers at least one advice or reminds you of something (may it be simple and obvious) that you just lost track of, is a good book :D \\-> Certain courses and other material is important too, since nowadays there are other ways to learn also, for example via. AI / Audio books / podcasts / streams / videos / meet-up's / lectures.....\\-> Books are not and will never be fully replaced, due to their availability and independencyIf anyone is interested in specific books that have to do with game development, contact me in a DM or on this post, then i may give some recommendations and some \"not worth it\" mentions hehe.Kind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team :)",

My undergrad was biochemistry and I really enjoyed chemistry. However, the phd chemists at my university did not seem happy nor was I interested in attempting a phd.

Nothing wrong with using C. You could also look at getting him into Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) UI framework and Dart language.

The programming projects (called *problem sets*) are more advanced than most beginning programming courses in the US because it's Harvard.If you do go to the bootcamp route, do some research to make sure it's legitimate. Apparently, a lot of it is kinda bad. There is CS50w which is web programming with Python and Javascript. You could take CS50p if you want a refreshed in Python. these courses are all part of the CS50 series of courses from Harvard though edX, a group of universities offering their course content to the public.",

Do this at least 6 months to a year, and then start prepping for \"real interviews\" learn your algorithms, do leetcode, etc. You'll never be ready but as long as you have ok understanding of data structures and most common algorithms on those structures you'll be good. Don't forget to also study software/systems design/architecture.Then, start applying to companies where you'd like to work or ones where the work has meaning to you, otherwise you'll suffer. Don't believe the promises startup will make and if you're either bored or tired of a low pay then jump ship to a bigger company, this time \"the bigger the better\" you want this second company to be crazy big, avoid big companies whose main focus isn't technology, i.e. prefer Uber instead of Lenovo, streaming at Disney rather than IT at Boeing. There you'll learn about big scale and other engineering practices, this is where you go from midlevel engineer to senior, but to enter these companies sell yourself as a senior. Again be proactive, don't limit yourself to be a developer, you should also do the deployments, monitoring, become a generalist that goes deep. At least 3 years in a company like this will do. Don't fall in to the politics governing these big companies, you're there to learn, let them play their little games.After that the world is your oyster, you should be looking for companies that are surfing a generational wave, for example nowadays looking at Anthropic or OpenAI would be good, every ~10 years or so there's a big trend you should follow, personally I've found my sweetspot is remote companies of around 100 people, maybe 50 engineers, not everything depends on you but you still have impact on the future direction, no politics and no drama. Aim to at least double the pay every-time you switch companies, and during interviews never reveal what did you get paid at the previous job, at some point it would be almost impossible but if you're good you might get lucky.Good luck!...or enroll in a bootcamp.",

After you pass the training they help you find a contracting gig with one of their clients. I ended up with Capital One, so they work with large companies. Unfortunately, you will be stuck with with a 2 year contract and lower than average pay, I only got 55k, but you still have benefits and if the company you are contracted with likes you they can buy out your contract and hire you. If not, you will at least have experience and they give you an option to stay another year and work with another client. My contract ended in 2021 and I'm not in the industry so Revature may have changed, but I would check them out. There are other companies with similar models too.",

Learning something in tech means knowing what it does, when to use it or not to use it, how to use it generally, and how to find things that you don't know in the docs or elsewhere.Do simple \"hello world\" apps in each of these, then start combining them.1. Make a simple html page that displays \"Hello, World!\"1. Change the color of the text using CSS1. Make the text cycle through colors when clicked using Javascript1. Put it in a GitHub repo1. Deploy it using Netlify and visit the site in your browser1. Do all of the same in React1. Do all of the same in Angular1. Fuck it - do the same in Vue1. Make a Node.js server with one endpoint that sends \"Hello, World!\"1. Update your frontends to request that text and load it into the page instead of hardcoding it in1. Deploy your Node.js server to Vercel1. Create a database and store the text in there1. Have your server fetch the data from the database, send it to the frontend clients you developed1. Now you built a backend and connected 4 frontend clients. You \"learned\" full stack development",

Don’t worry too much about mastering CSS design if it doesn’t excite you, nowadays, you can do a lot with AI tools anyway. You mostly need to understand how the DOM works.Next, learning JavaScript is essential. It’s widely used for both frontend and backend development, including frameworks like React and runtime environments like Node.js. You can learn both sides pretty quickly by following large full-project tutorials on YouTube. Stick with one, and whenever you’re curious about something, dive into the documentation or use GPT for deeper understanding. You’ll learn the most by building projects, it’s fun, gives you real-world experience, and helps you start building a portfolio. Check out the FreeCodeCamp website it offers a great roadmap and exercises to learn full-stack development. You don’t need six months. If you’re really driven, you can build strong foundations in just one month.",

Within a program and interacting from program to program was very much not that easy. Even now, having understood and used more abstract concepts like multiple inheritance, the diamond problem, writing with and without OOP, and functional programming. Breaking down a task and putting it into code is still not easy for me. It really just takes time for the specific use case, it'll take a few iterations of design, or a completely new design in the end. It'll never be perfect, there is no perfect, but there's good enough, and good enough works until there's another good enough to compare it to. This is especially true when writing a one-off program, you don't know how much time invested into each component is worth, so those programming design patterns are now weighed with your desire to get something to work. Deadlines make everything a mess. The thing that helps is practice. Practice a lot. Practice is the best way to learn once you know how to write. There's always something new to learn so that can also feel depressing, you'll get to a point though like where I'm at that not knowing something won't bother you, because you know you can learn how to use it quickly, or you can also invest a couple hours understanding it completely. Most problems can be understood completely, don't try to look at the LZMA2 source code or code that is all sprawled out and think it'll be understood fast or completely.I've been doing this for a decade or so but my projects still seem amateur or chaotic, this is actually quite normal outside of a serious investment of time. Embrace chaos for the most part.

Try new stuff, don't rely on tutorials unless you have to. And don't neglect the theory, that stuff _does_ matter, even if you don't really realise it. Do things outside of your course - I don't even think the specifics matter much as long as you have something interesting to talk about.- I guess I regret not learning more related tooling like Docker, K8s, etc. in my free time - I feel like they're handy to know and show a certain inclination that looks good on your resume.And for the love of all that is holy do not rely on AI.",

Start with FCC and do the html/css/JS content until you finish it, get painfully bored, or feel like you're spinning your wheels. When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.That's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.By the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp. It sounds like the market is pretty bad for bootcampers these days, so dunno if I'd recommend it in 2025. In my case, I did the bootcamp after coding off and on for like 2 years though. So YMMV.

Just try FreeCodeCamp's HTML course. Its free, most of the course work is done in the browser. If after completing the HTML course, and you're still as motivated to learn more, and the work is too easy, move to TheOdinProject. The objective is to **understand** fundamental principles.",

Private tool servers, private agents, refactoring and tightening up RBAC on APIs to accommodate more dynamic access patterns... those are things that there won't be one vendor for. Those are the things that take you from chat app party trick to wildly better UI and capabilities for business systems.Also I'll note that just like the pre AI tech scene, the vast vast amount of positions will be not in innovation and R&D but in application development. Every shop will be building AI apps and especially extending and refactoring their existing systems to leverage AI, and the primary skill set will be building, not working at the bleeding edge of technology, but developing applications for it. UX is about to go through a bigger revolution than the smart phone. This change is going to make backends be designed differently. And platforms. There's about to be a ton of dev work, even with our shiny new tools that let us build feature X much faster than we could build it 5 years ago. We'll find ways to leverage lower experienced contributors, it just won't be endless frontend feature factories; demand for said features will go down with AI powered UX (not bolted on chat bot bs), and where they are needed, AI slop can handle that.

I had Medicare for health expenses, with Social Security and IRAs for income, but I still loved to code, so I kept working as an IC. That's when something magical happened. When you don't need to work, but choose to anyway, all of the pressure, expectations, and stress just melt away. I found I could enjoy the work for its own sake. After all, the worst that could happen was I would get laid off, and then I could retire for real. I did actually get laid off from the first post-severance job. But it turns out that after 40+ years in the industry, you do learn how to interview, LeetCode and all, and how to make yourself appear valuable to a new team. So I started my second job the day after my first ended. I didn't even get a vacation to destress, LOL. For me, success was never about the money, promotions, or recognition.

Same for index\\_of, also O(n) time.So, completely disregarding the correctness, you have three calls to O(n) functions in your simpler approach, making the overall runtime far worse for large inputs. (EDIT for clarity: The inside of the loop changes from O(1) to O(n), so the entire algorithm changes from O(n) to O(n²), because of the outer loop)If you want to see it for yourself, choose a large integer (like 10\\_000\\_000) as your target, and only fill the array with random integers of less than half it's size. This way, your condition will never trigger, and you will need to go through the entire array. Now make the array of length 100 million, and watch the runtime difference.(This strongly depends on a good hash map / hash function for the values. This depends on your language. Make sure that the hash map works correctly, because if it doesn't it might also have O(n) runtime and you will not see a big difference XD)",

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust. Unless you're aiming for sub-ms optimizations, and have a problem that is uniquely suited, hashmaps are pretty much always going to be faster.",

But if you're looking at constant factors, doing the search twice instead of once doubles the cost.In general, if you're just given an array with a bunch of values (without any other information or being able to make any assumptions about what the values are), and you're asked \"does this array contain an element equal to X\", there's no way to answer without potentially searching the entire array. So no matter what language you're using or how it's implemented, if it contains a general built-in operation like `in_array`, that operation can't have a time complexity better than O(n).",

Without CS you'll just be typing in magic incantations without understanding why they work.2. Build projects. It doesn't matter as much what project it is or what language you pick. What matters is that you pick something you find interesting and keep working on it. Make it bigger, more complex. Make it polished and professional. Challenge yourself to make it better. Hit roadblocks and dead ends, get yourself unstuck. That's ultimately the only way to learn.",

        "body": "I have a little over 3.5 years of experience, and I’m at a mid-level position. I work in web dev.If I was starting out again, I’d do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.After becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I’d stop utilizing that approach for learning. I’d then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I’d start building tons of projects.The AI assistance I’d use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can’t just use it to build everything for you. Then you’re not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you’d have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.After building tons of projects, I’d get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.After doing this, I’d research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI’s help. AI isn’t thinking of security. You need to be. I’d download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don’t, it’s not because you don’t have any. It’s because you can’t find them.I myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can’t give you much more advice there, but that’s a starting point!The thing is, I’m providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.You also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won’t. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs. I was willing to do the dirty work when it came up, and I was also always willing to listen to my coworkers whenever they had constructive feedback.Some of my coworkers have described me as “starving” and “hungry” to learn. I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.The thing is, they’re working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn’t about the money. It’s about the experience. I don’t get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it’s about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.Finally, place yourself in positions where you’re not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you’re the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It’s a waste of your time unless you’re building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it’s primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.In code, don’t get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they’re very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.In the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible. My goal is to get higher quicker so that I can r/FIRE when I want to, where I want to, if I want to. I’m already in a position to coast FIRE. I am doing this for my freedom, and as a passion to program. You need to know why you’re doing this. Find your why. Remember your why. Be the “how” for your “why”.",

GitHub Pages sites are typically static, meaning the pages are pre-rendered, serialized, and deployed (e.g., a blog with 100 posts results in 100 individual HTML files). Static assets include images, fonts, and other media stored in the repository.When it comes to just the code and HTML output, 1GB is a huge amount of space. For example, I could easily deploy a fake blog with 3000 pages, and it still wouldn't come close to that limit.But if you start adding images, videos, or audio, the size grows quickly. That’s why common practice is to avoid bundling media directly in the repository. Instead, you might use a service like Cloudinary, which has a generous free tier, and link to your media, rather than having it stored in the repository and as part of the your output build.",

Do you want to build whizzy gadgets using microcontrollers? Get involved in designing new chips? Layout circuit boards for computers? Are you interested in RF engineering?You can start doing some of that stuff in the comfort of your own workshop while still earning a decent living as a software developer. Invest a few hundred bucks in basic tools like a good multimeter, soldering iron, etc., and few microcontroller boards such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico, and some simple components like switches, wire, resistors, etc. There are all sorts of fun projects that you can build with the most basic electronics knowledge. Modern microcontrollers are very easy to use and a ton of fun. This is probably the hardware equivalent of getting started in programming with an easy language like Python.Becoming a professional \"hardware engineer\" obviously involves a lot more than that. Go look up the degree requirements for a bachelors degree in electrical engineering at your favorite university to get a taste of what you don't know.Probably your best bet would be to find a software development role that's hardware-adjacent. You could start building microcontroller projects in your spare time to start learning about embedded programming, and once you feel up to speed on that start looking for programming roles on hardware development projects.",

I’m not sure which veterans you’ve met in Sub Saharan Africa that couldn’t swap an array. There are thousands of high schoolers in South Africa that can do that. At this point you’re arguing for argument sake. Or because you wanted to flex that you teach people. They specifically said they’re struggling with data structures and algorithms.

There must be a structured process of thinking instead barging directly to solve a problem. Even though if I read on Google how to solve a problem that also doesn't help me.

The reason you might want this is to improve security further, it means if an attacker chooses the password \"password123\" and they somehow get access to the encrypted passwords, they won't be able to know everyone else that used the same password (since they will have different encrypted passwords even though they had the same original password).Whenever you generate a password with a salt, you are supposed to store that salt and use it again when validating the password. If you don't store the salt, you CAN'T authenticate the password when the user tries to log in.Note that you can absolutely use unsalted encryption if you want, but it's less secure so it's not recommended.",

Also, use AI as a learning and exposure tool (by exposure I mean getting updated on what technical skills you should be learning).

Many here suggest frontend frameworks like react or svelte, that's an overkill. You will spend your time learning the framework instead of the basic principles. Stick to vanilla JavaScript. You will need a library to help you with visualization. Learning D3.js is a very good investment, you will be able to build many useful interactive visualisations with it in your career.Depending on how much you want to learn and how much effort you want to put into this, work through this book: https://www.manning.com/books/d3-js-in-action. You can preview the chapters and get a feel for what you will learn.",

Websites like Squarespace offering building kits in which you can make the global layout without coding and then refine things via. added scripts and libraries. 2. WordPress 3. HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe \"correct\" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.Easy-Mode: HTML + CSS Medium-Mode: add JavaScript Hard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databasesKind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team (I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",

The main reason for this is I can get caught up in wanting to make sure I'm doing something the optimal way, considering all options, looking at upstream and downstream dependencies to see how my work affects them, etc. This means I'm slower than someone who just crushes through the ticket, doing only what was asked. But doing this in my early career has allowed me to learn so much more, and develop more intuition for these kind of things. Now I can think of broad problems that touch many systems and much more easily consider the broad impact of changes in one system. This sets me up nicely to do high level design spanning many systems, makes me helpful in XFN collaboration with other teams, and helps me a lot with debugging/incident response. So I'm slower to code but I'm building the skills to become a senior+ engineer. Whereas in most companies just being fast and good at coding takes you to mid level tops.None of this matters if your company doesn't realize the value in that though.",

It is just a different way of thinking.So if I were you I would start with simplest problems possible - preferably the ones which is formulated in semi-formal way from the start.",

My suggestion is always to find a **complete** tutorial on something like udemy for $10-$20 and use it. Make sure it's a Beginner to expert tutorial that covers all aspects of the technology. If it's something big like JavaScript as a whole or React as a whole or all of Python, it should be at least 20-30 hours long. Go through the tutorial with the teacher, WRITE everything in your own IDE, do not just watch or listen, write it out yourself, the more senses you use in learning, the more likely your brain will consider it important. Watching a video is alright. Watching a video and taking notes is better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them (and getting it to work) is far better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them and then teaching it to someone else is even better. If you have no one to teach it to, teach it to the wall, or a chair, or a rubber duck, or whatever. The key is you need to be able to explain what is happening, or you don't really know what is happening.Once you're done doing the entire tutorial with the lecturer, if you feel up to it, start working on your own project. First create the repo with the technology boiler plate, don't know how? How did they do it in the tutorial? Then add some hardcoded text and things to the page. How? Check the tutorial. Then make the data dynamic and add a list of objects using a for loop, how? Check the tutorial. Then call an API, how? Check the tutorial. You get the picture.",

Make yourself do weird stuff with it, container in container in container anything you can think of, will help with cards later on and understanding parent and children. The random transform stuff you will use when needed and just google, hover the same thing, and you'll just remember it from then on. Display switches and other stuff just come with projects, but you won't use long-term, dark mode you'll use later on. It's a lot, but look at a page and ask yourself how that is there or why does it looks like that and recreates it. A great site would be apple to clone with html and css. Also, when structuring, I always give each container a random ass background color, which visually helps understanding what's going on. Good luck, and you got this!",

I think learning \"the hard way\" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \\- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \\- Firefox has similar, use the one you like. I've linked to the \"element\" section which helps answer the question \"why doesn't this thing do the thing I thought it should\". On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \\- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \\- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line. I've linked the framework I use, it will generate you CSS variables for free but there are plenty of other options available. Avoid tailwind until you actually understand CSS, once you've got a good handle on it give it a spin.",

        "body": "Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",

Don't be abstract like \"calculate value\", but rather, be as specific as possible, like \"multiply cost with (1 + tax), then divide results by 100\".Do this for each step until you are able to manually, with no code at all, complete the process reliably, regardless of which values are used.Once you're done, copy all the steps as comments to your code. Translate manual actions to code. Using the above example, you'd do a line like `(cost * (1 + tax)) / 100`. Repeat until all steps are done, and that should work great.Writing code is the easy part, but when it's coupled with having to solve a problem, it becomes complex. When you do this, you're fully separating the problem solving and the code. Once you got the process done, you can then set up the code for each step.Edit: some time ago, I was working on a mod, and used this method a lot as I was learning how to get things running.

I've known many good coders who placed in public suddenly choke and go cold. It's very different giving a speech to yourself in the mirror vs standing in front of a group of real people. Do this once a week. I guarantee you will get much better quickly! Not only that but you'll perform better later on when you're put on the spot in a job interview. Now, that being said - you could probably do this in a less stressful environment using AI as your person. There's probably some value in that but you won't get the stress response you really need.

Unless the users expect to refresh the page and have everything there.To do that you would need to create an API. Now, API just means, \"a way for two programs or program units to connect to each other and share data\", aka, \"application programming interface\".Since you are building a web app, you would need a web API. Python or NodeJS, or some other language. That basically opens a port and accepts HTTP connections. The usual data transfer format is JSON. Your API is basically the gateway and processing in front of the database. You send requests in some format, say the expressions the user enters, and the API takes your requests and writes them to the database.When your page loads, or some user-initated mechanism like a button, your web app will make a request to load the history from the database.Then you will need some function to manage the history, i.e. delete it.This of course is quite involved at your stage. A good thing about programming is that you can build simulations of what you need. Make an interface (a set of functions) for managing history in your web app. Then implement it as modifying some array in memory. Save it to localStorage if you want.Then later, when you are ready to jump into server-side programming, you can replace the functions with ones that call to your API instead.",

Your frontend can then make requests to the `/api/recent` URL using the browser's Fetch API (or any number of wrapper libraries around it).Writing an HTTP server in nothing but Node is doable but you have to deal with a bunch of low-level details yourself (e.g. URL parsing and routing).

If you have one, great - focus your time and energy on polishing that and do the other things post-launch. Remember, you do not need a perfect app out of the gate, you just need one killer feature - one new way of thinking. Lastly, if you focus all of your time on dev and don’t think about marketing, it won’t matter how good and polished the app is. Start right now splitting your time up between dev and marketing.",

Just a plain integer value of one.Now you have the multiplication of \"1\" and \"1.0\". One operahend is an integer and the other is a double precision floating point. Because they're different types, the integer will be converted into a double precision floating point. Then the two values will be multiplied together, getting the final result of 1.0.As for your second example of 1.0 * 3 / 2 = 1.5, you follow the same logic. First you have the multiplication of 1.0 * 3. The integer value of 3 is converted to the floating value of 3.0. The multiplication occurs, giving the floating result of 3.0. This is then divided by the integer value 2, but because the types don't match, the integer 2 is converted to the float 2.0, so you have 3.0/2.0 = 1.5.",

But also, plenty of people write awful documentation. They've spent too much time thinking too deeply about the problem they're solving and they neglect to simplify it for the reader, and the documentation is at least as much about bragging about their accomplishments or geeking or about their model train as it is helping people. I admit I'm prone to that myself.Others abstract away too much information. It's really hard to feel like you understand something if you're understanding is full of \"trust me\" and \"just because\".If an AI can explain something so it makes sense to you, then the problem isn't you.

This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \\`class Router\\`* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* \"How to route incoming requests in Framework X\". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g. [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)* Tutorials: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth* to accomplish some real world task. This is what most blog articles and video how-tos are going to be. E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB\\_7aWwJMc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB_7aWwJMc)* Books: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth and depth* to accomplish some real world tasks. [https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/) Knowing which type of documentation best matches your current question and skill level is important!As tempting as it is to accelerate towards a single answer using AI for a work task, I would encourage any beginner in a topic to avoid doing this. Learning, and indeed authoring, code is considerably more than answering a question or completing a task. As you read API docs for one method, you stumble upon another that might better solve your problem. When researching \"how do I route with an optional parameter\" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a \"weird routing bug\" has an obvious and simple solution to you (\"this route just needs to be higher precedence\").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: \"Well, *it works\".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a \"well, it works\" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change. This can happen *incredibly* quickly.",

It listens to those local Telegram groups, extracts location and context from messages, saves it to a database, and shows the results on an interactive map. Basically, you can load the map and see where people say TCC recruiters are. Like Pokémon Go, but very... Ukrainian :grinning_face_with_sweat:It works pretty well locally — but I haven’t shared it publicly, because there’s a risk I could be accused of “obstructing military operations,” which is a very sensitive topic here.Anyway, it’s not really real-time (no WebSockets or live updates yet), more like a snapshot when the page loads. I’d love to build something more light-hearted next, something fun and safe to share with others. Maybe even silly.Thanks again for the inspiration!",

Try/catch is easier to understand if you can practice by throwing your own errors so you can watch the catch behave how you expect. Auth is always one of the bigger pains within web dev, so it’s no surprise you switched to PHP as it’s server-side. I’ve worked with many people in a paid capacity helping people understand how to work with these tools. Feel free to DM me if you need help wrapping your head around a concept",

What do you want to build? It will be much easier if you're motivated to want to learn.

Buy Claude and vibe code your way through the project ensuring you understand everything. Your project should have at least 6 technologies going on with concurrency.

Competitions create a small number of winners and a large number of losers. Read this sub for a week and you’ll come to understand that lots of beginning programmers already feel that they’re not smart enough to ever really succeed.Competition pits people against each other. I get that some people enjoy testing themselves that way, and that’s fine, but it’s not for everyone. What particular skills do you think competition will teach or sharpen? Time management? Planning and decision making? Task prioritization? Whatever they are, why can’t you teach those skills some other way?In the real world, programming is much more about collaboration and teamwork than competition. The best programmers teach and inspire the people around them, and that helps them improve too. People spend time answering questions on sites like StackOverflow because helping others solve problems is a great way to learn. Is there a way that you can use collaboration to help your students improve? Maybe have the stronger students coach the weaker ones?",

If you can get good at them early on, you will get good at programming and in interviews.It's ok if you don't know how to do basic problems without help. Try it out first without looking at solutions, try it out for a max 1 hour. If you don't know how to do it, look at the solutions to understand the reasoning behind the solution. Your goal should always be to understand why the solution is written the way it is written (e.g., your solution uses an array but the solution uses a set - why are they using a set? Research array vs set and learn when to use a set instead of an array for certain situations). So don't just code the solution because you won't learn anything meaningful by doing that.",

Normally you would learn faster and efficiently what you actually like.To learn, a lot of it is deliberate thinking through of processes, and a lot of internalization of concepts comes through prolonged exposure.When you say you have 'forgotten a lot', what do you mean? There is always a constant set of concepts that underlies a lot of programming paradigms. Have a good grasp over those. Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo. Learn as much, and be ready to learn when you have a job. What matter is the ability to learn. 4. If your parents are asking for you to get a job, prioritize good learning environment. Ideally with senior devs. Good mentorship is totally another level of learning. I assume you are still early in your career. 3. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything takes time. You seems to have a sense of urgency. It can be useful, but remember long term you want to grow as a more complete dev.",

I would still need to check documentation for tailwind, and css grids to get things properly, but the point was I knew what the approach would be.\\---One thing I will say. Your first project that you completely do on your own will be long and hard. But keep in mind that this difficulty and frustration is the actualy a sign and a process of becoming better.Tutorials are there to give you a direction. To get out of the tutorial hell - give this strategy a shot: 1. Stop watching tutorial (specially if you feel you have reached a saturation point in terms of 'knowledge of doing things') 2. Start making things on by yourself. 3. You will get stuck in basic things like tsconfigs, vite, setting up, integrating tailwind. This is fine. 4. When you do solve them, be mindful how you solved them, and take notes as to why it worked now and not before.It will be a bit slow, but a project driven learning is something I personally like.",

This is called a foreign function interface. You see it most often with C because C is so old and has a well defined, unchanging way that functions are compiled.And the third way is the one you know- send bytes to another program in a defined format like json or xml and deserialize it on the other side. If you want to make it easy to define the types and methods in multiple languages at once, you can use an interface definition language like Google's protocol buffers, which can then be used to generate functions and type definitions in a number of supported programming languages.",

        "body": "The term API exists outside of web services. One language can have an API that other languages can use. To contrast this, lower level systems often have ABIs (application binary interfaces). An ABI doesn't have friction calls so much as \"put a value in this address in memory and/or jump to this memory address\". Anything where the thing you're calling is defined in source code terms is an API. A really common example of two languages talking to eachother is Python and C. Python is very easy to use but not very fast, so many of the performance-focused libraries like NumPy have the number crunching written in C and the python code calls the C code. There's a guide on that here https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/Another example: every single web browser that supports web assembly (WASM) does this; certain things can't be done in WASM so you need to be able to run JavaScript from your WASM code. The browsers provide an API for this. If you want to communicate between two different running programs there are a variety of message passing methods out here.",

Books are set in stone, so what you're learning may not always be the most up to date. However, if you learn well from books, O'Reilly has a massive collection. You can't download as a PDF/epub from the site, but you can download the books to read within the O'Reilly app on Android and iOS. There are supposedly some chrome extensions and tools which allow you to download the books as PDFs to bypass the rights restrictions, but to be honest if you're going to do that anyway, you might just consider downloading the books from illegitimate sources, as pretty much all the books are available from the usual pirated ebook places. That's a moral decision on your part - subscribing to O'Reilly means at least the authors are getting, I assume, a cut of the subscription fee if the books are accessed.",

That'd be one of the easiest ways to build it. You could start here: [https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1) \\- then in a few weeks when you're comfortable with basics, follow a pygame tutorial.Either way, I think a reasonable expectation might be that if you start to learn programming today, it might be a month or two of learning before you'd be ready to try building something like this. Maybe more or less. It's not something you could start on day one, but it wouldn't take years.",

When I did esports I learned how important just “raw-dogging” it is. I studied footage for like 2 hours then practiced for 8 hours, trying to apply whatever was identified in the footage. Had a really good coach who really taught me how to learn.Remember an engineer doesn’t just make stuff. You will inevitably need to deal with something you lack experience in. Obviously make sure the scope of the project isn’t insane. Scope management is also a skill of an engineer. You likely wont make a great product your first few attempts but start the process of failing a lot and learning now.",

Some advice I was given was leave in my comments and explanations in my code for the repository. It shows I actually understand and gives a view on how my logical thinking works. Looking for work while going back to college has been daunting. I did a 1 year advanced cert to get into uni but I haven’t received the award yet and nobody is recognising it as completed until I have the physical copy. CS50 was a great way to test the waters of wether I wanted to do programming full time and the community college recognised CS50 allowing me to skip the first year of that course (it should have been 2 years). LeetCode and those are ok for interview prep and preparing yourself but start making some projects of your own to show you have a full understanding of how to build, edit and manage programs. The portfolio is t only example of what you can actually do.",

The goal is not to memorize how to do everything, but to just do a lot of simple things until it's conceptually super easy, then you can try something one step harder.For instance, if you told me to make a chat app right now, i could easily break it down into, ok, some kind of client with a UI, prompt for user input, then we have to send the input to the server, then, ok, the server has to be python or node or whatever, then we have to store all the chat sessions that come in, and propagate messages to the receiving end, then that client needs to process it and display it in the UI, and maybe cache some stuff or whatever. Then I could just go implement one little thing at a time and make sure it works as expected, and see if other little surprises crop up.But I can only do this because I spent so much time at one point just making trivial client and server, or just making a trivial web UI that does nothing, or just really basic data structure stuff, etc.You also need to have a reasonable environment where you can run your code very often comfortably, and be ready to print things or use a debugger to inspect what's going on. That could mean learning basic terminal commands, or maybe getting comfortable with an IDE.",

The rest is kinda wack though. They probably don't need 500 tables on a single db, they probably should have some sort of naming convention (`t_tablename` for tables, `vw_viewname` for views, whatever, it doesn't really matter as long as there's some consistency), and there's maybe a better way than many to many relationships to organize things, but that depends. Having different names of columns on one table vs another that it references by fkey isn't that weird if that's what you mean for the sub_id/original_sub_id thing.That said, I don't know any more about the company than what you've said here, so there could be a reason for how things are, and if it does have to be changed, it's probably going to be a lot more time consuming than you might hope. It's not the end of the world to have some tech debt jank, especially for a startup. I'd ask why things are how they are before even considering how to fix it. Worst case you can just recommend that devs are a bit more organized and consistent in how they're using their database(s) and try to not make the problem worse.",

But due to three naming conventions I have to go through each and every one of them just to figure out what is the name here. To further add headache the relationship are many to many. I am not even sure if this helps but there are many columns that come from API but even there the naming conventions are different. Here's an example country_id is the column name in table1 and I need table2 to join at country_id because that's where the weather report comes from but the column is called weather_ids_country I thought this was a mistake so I asked the team they are like no this is correct. It means the same thing. I am like fine. Now everything is in integer so I need the values which comes from API on that it is called currency_code_id it means the same thing. Now if this was present in one column I would have brute force this connection but it is present everywhere.",

At least in my country, Spring with Java/Kotlin is solid, so I think learning it is fine. It's not a bad framework once you get used to it.So maybe you should focus more on software architecture instead of language syntax. Sure, Clean Code sucks, but what are the alternatives? Why are so many projects using it? Even when using Go or Rust, you have to deal with complexity as the codebase grows, and eventually, you have to design an architecture that scales.I think learning Go or Rust and trying to make a web app is a good experience and gives you insight into why Spring needs to be such a complex piece of software.",

I’ve been told coding is like understanding many different languages, you will never “master” it but you’ll become proficient enough to learn any language you spend time on. I know when I began learning html, css, and JavaScript, especially the JavaScript portion took repetition before I didn’t feel like I was stumbling through it and googling what I wanted all the time ( I still use resources, I think we all will as long as we code). I’m currently in my very first term of a BS in computer science, we haven’t coded one bit we are doing gen Ed and mathematics classes, so far I’ve learned more about programming and code from my minimal side projects and building tools for friends. of course this is not a professional level, but I’m getting the hands on practice that is necessary to start understanding it. Unless you are a tech savant, I don’t think you will fast track that golden expert programmer status. Have fun with it and put forth the practice needed to become proficient enough. That’s my thought process anyway, I wish you the best of luck!",

If your goal is to learn programming and have fun, and if you enjoy re-inventing certain wheels, then go for it!If you're just trying to deliver maintainable software in a business context then, generally, I think you should always re-invent the tiny wheels unless they are already solved by existing dependencies that are used in the codebase. The big wheels you should only re-invent if it's truly the project's area of innovation. The medium wheels are a bit more case-by-case but generally you shouldn't re-invent these wheels, either, without a good reason. But if for example, the medium wheel needs to be integrated in a novel way or or in a way that has to be coupled for performance reasons or other unusual considerations then it can make sense to re-invent even medium wheels. Just depends.Re: your JavaFX program, if it gives the results you want, you're fine. I don't know anything about JavaFX but If the UI isn't snappy you might want an event bus more for its asynchronicity than its decoupling purposes. I find an event bus annoying if not needed because things can feel like 1x1 squares and it can start to be hard to debug really complicated situations. I'd prefer a typical pub/sub approach if just trying to break the bi-directional dependency between the sub controllers and the top-level controller simply because it's easier to reason about and trace through the code than an event bus integration. But it totally depends on the scenario and the tradeoffs.",

Realizing your first solution isn't optional and making changes in order to fix it is invaluable experience that should be encouraged when you are in school.The use of libraries is more encouraged when you are getting paid for programming, but that decision is normally made by an architect or senior developer. Junior developers are expected to learn any libraries the senior members think would be useful for the project.Having experience using libraries is something you can add to your resume because that means onboarding will be faster if you know the technology stack. That means learning libraries is beneficial.Deciding what libraries to learn is complicated. You want to learn libraries that you enjoy using and are popular for a long time. Figuring out what libraries fit that criteria is difficult.",

There is definitely value in learning how to do something yourself, but if you come back to a project in even a month, chances are you'll have to relearn your own approach (almost from scratch). Without the documentation and community knowledge to help. That relearning takes a long time, and isn't transferrable to another project with its own implementation. I will also say, there may be edge cases to your problem that only become apparent later, and you end up needing a more robust framework. Dealing with [time and timezones](https://xkcd.com/1883/) is a famous example of this;",

There's also a lot of value in understanding the code inside and out, even if it's not as streamlined / professional as it could be. This is 10x as true when you're learning!My guideline is to lean heavily towards \"roll your own\" on *anything* that is \"core\" to your project. Whatever the value add of your project is, **don't** outsource that to someone or something else, because that can leave you really vulnerable. It sounds like you're applying this principle well already. :thumbs_up:Also as a note... It's really unlikely that existing software is as fast as possible *for your specific use case,* because off-the-shelf software by it's very nature needs to be built more robustly to handle *multiple* potential use cases. If you could peak \"under the hood\" of the Google event service... You would likely find lots and lots of code and checks *your project doesn't need,* because it's written to be broadly applicable to multiple different kinds of clients. Which is all to say... I'm skeptical that it's actually faster, and if it is it's because you don't yet know how to write an optimized event service... Which is a *really good reason* to get experience writing event services. :upside-down_face:I definitely would use JavaFX or Swing, or w/e else for the \"skin\" of the UI, and not feel bad about it because it doesn't really impact the core of the project. If JavaFX suddenly (for some reason) became totally unavailable for you to use, you *could* totally re-write the GUI of the project to use Swing instead, and it would suck, but it would be doable. The *core* of the project would stay intact, and it would be just as valid and useful regardless of what the UI looks like.Where it's really tough, is when you're under a lot of time / financial / social pressure to release a finished project fast, and although you would *rather* roll your own for certain parts of the project... You're pushed towards using off-the-shelf solutions. I think in that case, all I can say is 1.) be careful about identifying which things are closer to the core of your project, and 2.) be reasonable and honest about the tradeoffs you're making.",

Then, your options are either pasting the error to the AI and hoping for the best (which usually results in many rounds of headaches), or take the time to actually research what is going on and find a solution the old fashioned way. Either way, even though it looks at first like an amazing time savings machine, the luster wears off pretty quickly when you spend time actually putting the code it wrote into production. I feel like we are currently at peak AI hype, and it is going to come crashing down hard once people have spent more time with it. Another point is that the models seem to have hit a wall. They keep releasing new models but their coding abilities are not getting significantly better with the latest models, if anything they are going backwards.",

Exactly that. You're fielding calls for new jobs, when you've *just* started a job a few months ago. While the recruiter might've thought that was fine, the hiring manager obviously did not. Usually when you start a new job, you at least give it a fair shot.

You have been doing PHP for 13 years and they ask such random PHP question that you couldn’t answer. That basically means that either you have just been fucking around with PHP for the past 13 years as a fraud, which I don’t believe, or the questions are just so arcane that you most likely wouldn’t have been able to answer even with preparation anyways.Also the recruiter has been completely misleading too, let’s not forget that part. You were told to prepare for sys design and some knowledge on redis/java, which had nothing on PHP. You were set up to fail from this perspective too.The company also clearly didn’t know what to do for interviews. Pop quiz on random knowledge is stupid and insane. They would have been better to give you a take home even.I just think calling yourself a failure after what clearly is failure on their part is unwarranted.

Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me \"What's your favorite design pattern?\". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't \"Builder... because it's the only one I remember\". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions. But you should absolutely still expect to be asked questions about the basics and fundamentals. Even an hour of prep should make those kinds of questions trivial for you to answer.",

Maybe I'll try again later when the market gets better but honestly kind of over it. Finding a job is mainly on luck, even if you have years of experience it doesn't mean you'll get a job unless you do 100 other things. You have to network with everyone, have to tailor each and every resume to so you have a chance to pass ATS but you can't have too many key word cause that'll be flagged too, write cover letters and you don't even know if it'll be read by a human or computer. Some companies will give you homework before even speaking to anyone (don't do those you shouldn't have to work for free), pass a minimum of 4 interview rounds, and so on and so forth. If it is honestly something you think is worth putting up with and is passionate about then yah continue with this field. Otherwise maybe it's time to pivot. There are jobs out there that require any type of degree to get started. Definitely not going to pay as much as a dev job, but those salaries are also decreasing.Software development is in a strange category, it's treated as a STEM job but also something similar to art. It is now expected to be working on personal projects outside of work like how art is, but also is insanely technical and time consuming. I don't think many other STEM fields are like this. I don't think chemists are expected to be mixing chemicals in their basement over the weekend, but we are expected to be constantly working on some sort of side project all the time.

Unorganized resumes, outside of core time zones, not enough job info, not enough experience, frequent job hopping. On job hopping, the previous mindset of bounce every 2 years can start to ding you at higher levels.

Be strategic how you peel back the onion on this question with some companies. To direct it can seem like you don’t manage your time well or you’re looking to clock in and out. With all the layoffs in the industry teams are having to do more with less. Assume you’re walking into a blended culture and balance your time wisely.

They're not a fit for the role, they probably know this, but getting as many intros as you can is the name of the game. I totally get it, no beef here.For you this means: if you see a role where your skills line up, GOOD RESUMES STAND OUT, so invest time in your resume and then invest more time in it.2. Instant resume killersYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.If all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.What I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.Illustrating these will impress me more than a contextless \"Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion\"3. Interview stuffI'm always rooting for the candidate. I am also always thinking of my team and thinking, \"how will this person improve us\". Keep that in mind when I'm forced to ask HR question \"tell me a time contrived event happened\". Beyond that, biggest pointers I'd give are\\- I pass plenty of people who struggle in technical qualifiersIf you're struggling, don't panic, but don't try to hide it either. The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think \"well this is close to criticism but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok\", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to \"I'm looking for $goodthing\" and don't say \"past employer had $badthing\". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of \"tell me a time X happened\", don't make one up, just say: \"I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z\". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle. If you just make something up there's nothing real and human there and it does show through. I'd much rather you told me a sort of similar thing you did have to deal with rather than make something upBit of a stream of consciousness there sorry about that.

Most of the applicants were filtered out by our corporate recruiter for not having the required experience on their resume, but one was rejected at the recruiter level for being too arrogant. I have no idea what the applicant did to annoy the recruiter, since I wasn't a part of that interview. Another was rejected by the recruiter because they weren't good at communicating back to the recruiter within a reasonable amount of time.There were a lot of good applicants, and many of them would have no doubt been great hires. We.sent out a programming project to our applicants which had a \"Bonus points for...\" section. A few applicants did the bare minimum,. but the person I hired did well on the test and also completed the \"bonus points\" section. The person was also honest with their weaknesses, which was a plus for us.There is definitely an advantage in being one of the first applicants.

        "body": ">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salariesAnd companies won't believe you.One of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.Lots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say \"Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!\", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.Another example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company \"I'll be totally happy in your role\", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.That same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the \"impossible to retain\" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.All of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.But your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.You need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim \"age-ism\", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",

I actually believe the 30% of code written by AI because it is genuinely a super useful tool writing unit tests, boiler plate code, some specific LINQ or SQL query, etc. I don't think that statement is the equivalent of 30% of engineers are purely using AI to write their code while 70% are not. Even the smartest engineers I know use AI to help them write code. For the future, I think every developer is going to need to have a solid understanding of AI.

The other is that at some of these levels, you do have to build bespoke tooling.Of course, it's also the case that when you usually only have \"a bunch of Linux machines, an SSH session, and some certs\" (as the joke in the interview went, I think), you spend less time on keeping up with general tooling that you can't use anyway.>I'm curious why he's calling this out when pointing out a need for availability, given that CRDB's [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions#how-is-cockroachdb-both-highly-available-and-strongly-consistent) points out that they're explicitly strongly consistent.

You can assume enrollments in India had gone up for 2022-2023 as the job market hadn't crashed yet -- and is possibly even still increasing due to reports of outsourcing and FAANG building out even more campuses in Hyderabad/Bangalore.BLS reported that there are [2.6 mil ](https://www.inapps.net/how-many-software-developers-are-in-the-world/)software engineers in the U.S. as of 2023.

It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market. The AI 2027 paper was also spread ad nauseam by other people who have even More vested interest in the hype train staying rolling than the authors themselves. Not that I really care what Bill Gates says in a press release. It's not like he is transparently sharing insight or anything, it is also PR and marketing.I'm sure I'll catch plenty of downvotes over it, but you asked where we saw this going ourselves. Personally, I'm of the mind that AI is already showing fundamental issues that more compute won't solve, and there will be a breaking point that VC money stops fueling AI research companies. The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify. Think about how good and revolutionary Uber/DoorDash/AirBnB were when they first came out, and how those disruptor business evolved over time into nickel and dime hell holes. For all of those, we went from the old inconvenient model that had full time employees, to now the gig economy with no benefits and lower wages. We disrupted those markets so good. I'm well aware that I would be considered an AI pessimist, but it boggles my mind at how uncritically everyone is accepting a home brew board game research paper saying we hit singularity in 18 months. It feels like there is no space for caution or reasoning now that every tech illiterate middle manager thinks it's a freaking panacea for unlimited profit margin",

Taking into account economic and societal factors and the market behaving rationally, it only makes sense that automating doctors (at least family medicine for mostly healthy patients) would be the priority... But I'm guessing that slow regulations and irrationality means this won't happen as quickly as it should.Meanwhile, nothing excites developers more than building a new tool for developers. So that's where we're seeing most of the hype and movement right now. It's not really what the market needs but since we can't trust AI for much else, code generation becomes the focus. It doesn't hurt that good developers are expensive and there is potentially trillions in value if they can figure out a fully capable AI developer.",

I did a semester of an MS in Computer Science before I got my first job, and I can confidently say I haven't used any of the things I've learned in the courses I took. School will teach you how to theorize, design algorithms, and a bunch of other stuff that most software engineers rarely need to do (and when they do, they can just use their critical thinking skills and Google lol). What it won't teach you is how to deal with stakeholders, find which of 90 microservices you need to connect to fetch a certain piece of data, office politics, prioritization and putting together a minimum viable product, dealing with ambiguous and poorly thought out requests from users, and a ton of other things that are actually useful in a real world software engineer job.

It's the same papers we'd read back then, that are the corner stone for ML work now.The difference is that most people werent in research in Bachelors, hence they didn't get exposure needed for ML work. It's a different ball game now. Everyone wanted to do ML/AI after 2021. You have had so many people go into a Masters just to be able to do ML jobs, and alot of these people still don't get the level of exposure needed in research to be doing research work in the field, so they end up doing the SWE work related to ML that was done by experienced SWEs before.End of day, ML isn't some magic land that needs to be gatekept. An experienced SWE should be able to transition into ML after a bit of training here and there.

I've met tech recruiters who know nothing about tech and have no interest in learning more, and it's wild that the supply of devs allows the recruiters to be so incompetent. There are also some companies whose hiring might be led by someone who's not technical, so they focus on languages rather than general skillset, and it's worth avoiding those companies anyway (though this probably isn't something I should say to someone who needs a job a lot at the moment). Honestly if you're confident in your ability to pick up a reasonable language (like Java), I'd just lie.",

It's possible if you had gotten past the recruiter, it wouldn't have been an issue with devs you interviewed with. Every company will be different. To be perfectly honest, most of the companies I've interviewed at cared about explicit language experience. Once you're working there, they may throw you on a project where you don't have experience with the stack, but you're already being paid by that point. Someone I know who worked in the FAANG space said that language-specific experience seemed really bizarre to him. We can argue about what's fair and what makes sense, but it's ultimately the company's decision of how they want to evaluate candidates.Part of being more selective is because of the market. They can afford to be. A few years ago, the bar dropped quite a bit. There's also some argument for practical experience. Yes, you can have great fundamentals, but what about someone with great fundamentals and relevant experience? There's a strong chance that there are plenty of people who can pick things up and be successful, but they're just trying to have more of a \"sure thing.\"Here's another question. If you don't have Java on your resume, and it was a requirement, why would they even set up a call with you? It's a very flawed system.",

The guy in his 70's is by far the best programmer on the team, the depth of his knowledge and speed at which he accomplishes things never fails to impress. It's pretty universal that when someone, even people not on our team, has a problem they just cannot seem to figure out they go to him and he always finds a way to solve it. He codes everyday, and often works extra hours even though no one has asked him to or implied he should. He has no interest in any sort of management or lead role, he wants to write code and solve problems while others deal with the politics. He's also just a wonderful person in general, incredibly friendly and can talk for hours. I dread the day he decides to finally retire because of the immense loss it will be.",

Both have great resume value despite what you hear online. Apple is more “prestigious”, which will impress people whose opinion doesn’t matter. The name probably has a leg up when it comes to recruiting, but the difference is small unless you work on something notable (in IS&T… you probably won’t).I got interviews at OpenAI, every other FAANG, Uber, etc etc and my Amazon experience was the focus of most discussions (mainly because it was most recent, but partly because it was more challenging work).In general, IS&T is a shitshow. Many contractors who, frankly, could not pull their weight. Apple is also frugal - despite, again, Amazon’s reputation here, Apple is pretty similar (low PTO, very few “freebies”, pays less than AMZN etc). In general though, I still think Amazon is a worse place to work. Culture sucks, too much bureaucracy, and a lot more busy work than what I had at Apple.To be completely honest, if I were in your shoes, I’d choose the place you’d rather live: Austin or Seattle. Spend time building connections, making friends, etc. Personally, I’d aim to do good work and bounce within 2 years. Your exit opportunities should be similar.",

        "body": "tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive. Summary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues). I believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.The whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company. The first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the \"important\" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew. I made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a \"sink or swim\" mentality. Eventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change. They moved me back into dev in 2024 as a \"last chance.\" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA. I work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect. Several other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they \"aren't interested in being a school\". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).This company is hugely toxic (its one of those \"corporate family\" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change. For what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks. The area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway. To be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues. Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Good luck out there.",

When I first joined I was super confused and a lot of my coworkers were extremely smart and had this inner motivation to go above and beyond at their job that I lacked. I’m not a lazy or dumb person either — I have lots of hobbies outside of work and I do my work well enough. I even enjoy it sometimes. But I still often felt like I was a “bad employee” or “not cut out for this industry” because I didn’t care to think much about my job after working hours. I’ve had brief feelings of this again as I’ve been looking to change companies. All the job descriptions and requirements are loaded with expectations about who you ought to be and what you ought to value (e.g. “must be PASSIONATE about building highly scalable, available tech,” “must be HUNGRY to learn about unfamiliar tech and to challenge the status quo”, etc). Like.. I enjoy coding and solving problems well enough, but ultimately I’m looking for a job to pay my bills and to save money for retirement. It’s logical to expect certain skills, but why these intangible personality requirements? Why isn’t it enough to know Java/AWS and to have experience building scalable systems? Why am I expected to *feel* a certain way about these things? Am I really an inferior candidate because I don’t wake up every morning maniacally excited to build a feature? I don’t have a lot of advice persay. But what I will say is that as time has gone on, Ive come to a place where I don’t care about meeting these expectations lmao. Like there’s so much more to life. I have good friends, a good partner, things I love to do, and valuable qualities beyond how obsessively I think about building software. I’m thankful for my job and the learning and resources it’s provided me. But I don’t care as much as these companies tell me I should and that’s okay. I’ll fake it when I need to but I won’t betray myself just to feel adequate or whatever. That’s all to say.. I think what I’ve realized at this point is that there isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m just a normal person trying to live a decently happy, balanced life. It sounds like the same is true for you. If anything, there’s something deeply wrong with this culture we’ve created where we not only expect people to work a lot, we expect people to center their entire identity and passion around making money and being productive/innovative for a corporations benefit. It’s extremely disingenuous and it coerces us into devaluing ourselves and our own happiness.Anyways, that was longer than I expected. But hopefully gives some useful perspective! Good luck! And you’ll get the tech stack eventually, I promise!",

You just need to look at your situation in life, look at the companies/projects and whether they're likely to go through layoffs, and decide just how much happier you'd be in the new company.

You have a great chance to learn a lot here and earn a strong reputation in your current company. If you have a good manager he should understand your side of the situation, and try to support you.If you get more people, that’s great, I wouldn’t worry too much, there’s very few downsides in the long run. You’ll learn from the principal engineer and have a team to rely on.If you don’t though it’ll obviously be harder for you and the team. You’ll still learn a lot, and there’s a great leadership opportunity there for both yourself and the other engineer you’ll be working with, but yes you’re right it’ll be more stressful for you both.IMO it depends on how much the company is willing to support the team.

Since you're being given a 6-month window, you can ask about things like backfilling. But, it takes time to hire people, especially the right people. There's no guarantee you'll find someone before the other dev leaves. There's also no guarantee the new person is actually good. So, for the overall stability of the team, it's good that the knowledge be shared/spread around.Ask your manager about the backfill and your concerns about workload, due to handling all the requests from the customer. Hopefully, they will help manage that. This might be a really great opportunity, or it could turn into a nightmare. At least some of it will be impacted by your attitude going into it. There are a lot of times in life something will come up, and you won't feel ready. But a lot of people rise to the occasion. And if you don't, hopefully you can still learn from it.",

No AI generation, IMO those sound so fake and such insincere BS.  Get a template going written uhhh ‘from the heart’ and tailor it per company based on the company’s mission statement on their website, and include some things from the job posting as to why you would be a good fit and how much this would mean to you, and you believe in their mission of xyz  - something like that-focus on applying locally, hybrid or on site.  Remote jobs are flooded with hundreds of applicants, all with the same AI generated buzz-word-salad, I have no idea how HR swifts through them without choosing the completely wrong people. In my experience hospitals, local colleges and some insurance companies have easier interview processes with easy programming tests/questions (as they’re usually behind on the times, err…)-get a friend to do a mock interview with you, get them to ask questions a company would, and get their input on your answers.  or if you have no friends, watch YouTube videos on interviewing questions and how to answer them well, and practice in front of the mirror-also I agree with other comments, leave your gpa out and don’t say you were let go due to performance.  If anything you can turn this into a decent “what’s a flaw you have” answer…. I actually used this on my interview (that I got the job for).  I said I had a problem saying no, and take too much on and get stressed out.  But that I have learned to prioritize better and set better expectations with others.  This might help you exceed more in your new role too, sounds like you were like me. Good luck",

Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. You have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. Besides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?* NoSQL?* Any cloud experience?* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? * Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?Those are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. While LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. One other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students. Terrible advice gets shared here all the time.The last thing is try not to get too discouraged. The market is rough, and finding a job when you don't have one is always harder.",

I know a few other big tech companies have something similarWe also travel to custom sites occasionally and scope the problem and do system design for a couple days before we go and work directly with customer engineers to build the thing (remote). Involves lots of soft skills, tradeoffs, customer expectation management, priority scoping, that kind of thing",

If you can get two years or even one year if you want to stay in startups, that opens DOORS. Also, you'll end up doing a lot more work, but at this stage that's not a bad thing.

A risky startup is a risky startup in any market. A stable startup is a stable startup in any market. Your risk is if the startup disappears tomorrow, it might take you some time to get a new job.

You will quickly get used to getting things done quickly and effectively and learning how to manage priorities and getting confidence to innovate. You would also likely build a much stronger network and bond with the startup team than the run of the mill mature larger company with a lot more established processes. Most likely you will also quickly outpace the average FAANG engineer in terms of upskilling and improving by far. But this is all assuming you can pull your weight in the startup and not get let go for underperforming in the first month and also assuming the startup itself is a good environment (good leadership/mentors/culture, etc). The answer to this is how risk averse you are and how willing you are to put in work and what your priorities are. The smaller the startup, the more brutal it will be in terms of workload and expectations and “hire fast, fire faster” is the norm but there are benefits to it that I mentioned above. The larger the company is, you will have more stability but the work in general tends to be more boring with less agency, you don’t learn as much as quickly as at a startup, and the amount of process and red tape required to do things get more and more overwhelming. This leads to a lot of incompetent people that are just coasting and coworkers that are dead weight in larger companies whereas in a startup they would be canned in a week.To me, your situation is not about the difference in pay at all. It is not relevant. The startup will have you work many more hours than the government job so if you account for hours worked, the government job would technically be higher pay.",

        "body": "English is my first language, but I learned Spanish well enough to present at tech conferences in Spanish, so I do have language learning experience.Regarding A1-A2 active vocabulary: you’ve gotta move a lot of stuff from passive to active vocabulary. Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.Also, if you have flash cards, work them in the “I need to produce English” direction. If you don’t have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.Also: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person’s vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we’re talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.For specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.Regarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. As your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you’ll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. “That’s a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic…” is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being “uhhhhh” or worse, a non-English filler like “eeehmmmmmm.”Regarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you’ve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching. If your native language has far fewer vowels than English (for example, Spanish has 5, and Italian has 7), then you will want to learn some new ones. The two Italian has that Spanish doesn’t (open o and open e) are common in English, but English also has an open i, where the tongue is placed midway between Spanish’s i and e, and the sound in “put” which is midway between o and u.",

The key is talking through your thought process out loud: start with requirements gathering, estimate scale, design the basic components, then discuss how you'd handle bottlenecks.You can get interview-ready in about 2-3 weeks if you dedicate 2-3 hours daily. Watch YouTube videos from channels like Gaurav Sen or System Design Interview, but spend most of your time actually practicing mock interviews out loud. The biggest mistake people make is studying passively - you need to practice articulating your designs and defending your choices. Don't aim for perfection; aim for clear communication and logical reasoning. Interviewers care more about how you think through problems than whether you know the exact details of how Netflix's CDN works.I'm on the team that built Interviews Chat, and our prep module can help you practice system design questions with AI feedback based on real job descriptions, which might be useful for getting comfortable with the format and improving your explanations.",

He sends me interview requests for next stages of the interviewing and after I interview the candidate we go through the expectations once more.

You're saving exactly 1 words worth of space on your resume, at the expense of not listing a very important keyword because you think they'll just figure it out.What if a company is asking for Java experience, but *not* SpringBoot experience? Say they use Micronaut or something, but would totally be open to hiring someone that at least knows Java.Even ignoring the recruiter, in that scenario your resume is likely to get filtered out by an automated screener because you're leaving it up to the human reader to implicitly figure out you know Java. Your resume is supposed to be extermely *explicit*. You don't want to leave it up to the reader to figure out what you're trying to tell them, *tell them directly*.Not only that... but you know you can generate a SpringBoot project using Kotlin or Groovy, right? Which one do you know? Kotlin, Groovy, Java, or all 3?Be explicit. Don't hope they'll figure it out on their own. Whether they know the things you're asking or not doesn't matter, *be explicit*. This is your resume, not deep poetry that has underlying meanings meant for the reader to discover.",

At the moment asking them to take my JafaFX dialog and put it in a JDialog to make the dlg modal over Swing controls. No LLM can do something this simple, they all fuck it up. And this is one class without much complexity. They are a long way from being let loose on our 10 million line codebase of bespoke classes. I was looking at one of my kids homework assignments the other day as she could not figure it out. I started with LLMs but they could not do C allocation and deallocation. Only because the assignment used an int\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* for an array of ints, instead o int\\*. It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment. I only find AI useful for small well defined pieces of code. What would have taken an hour to find on the web and then tweak for my use case, can now be done in a few minutes. It is great for that sort of thing. But you better understand the code it gives you and be able to debug/refactor/modify it. In the future there could be breakthroughs that get us AGI and then it is game over. But I think it will be for every job if that happens.",

Sure, if we get a higher salary the recruiter gets a slightly bigger cut, but the recruiter would rather lowball you and get you placed fast. The higher the salary you demand, the harder you are for them to place. They'll do anything they can to get you placed *anywhere*. A cut of a lowball $60k offer is better than a cut of $0. They don't care if the company is toxic, boring, and a bait & switch, they get paid either way the minute you accept the offer.I'm not a fan of 3rd party recruiters.

My average tenure is around 2 years, and I've found that I'm almost always ready to move on for more money and a change in scenery by then.I also do hiring with some frequency, and let me tell you that ***some*** short tenures on resumes don't really bother me much at all. This career doesn't have much stability and finding a good fit can be really hard.Additionally, my experience has been that people who stay with the same employer for long periods of time (5+ years) tend to have less varied/useful amounts of experience and will not generally have as versatile (or up-to-date) a skillset as someone who has had 3 different jobs in the same amount of time.There's definitely a lower limit though, a career that's only multiple years of 6 month contracts/employers, for example, does not look great to anyone, as it appears to signal that the employee can't ever meet expectations well enough to stay on anywhere.",

The key is making sure your projects stand out - instead of building generic todo apps, try to create something that solves a real problem or demonstrates genuine technical curiosity. Focus on one language really well rather than jumping around, and make sure you can explain every line of code in your projects because interviewers will dig deep.

The key is reframing your experience to highlight what you do know rather than focusing on what you don't.Stop trying to become an expert in everything and pick one path to focus on. If you want data engineering, lean into your Databricks and PySpark experience even if it was 2 years ago - refresh yourself with some quick projects and be honest about the timeline when asked. For the business analyst roles, emphasize your analytical thinking and problem-solving approach even without direct client interaction.

The fact that you're questioning what to learn next shows you've built a good foundation, but you're right to feel lost because you're at that awkward intermediate stage where generic roadmaps stop being helpful.Your instinct to focus on what genuinely interests you is spot on and will serve you better than forcing yourself through AWS tutorials you'll forget in a month. Since you enjoyed complex SQL queries and system design, lean into that - start building projects that let you implement interesting database architectures or solve actual scaling problems. Think about creating something like a URL shortener with custom analytics, a chat application that handles real concurrency issues, or even contributing to open source projects where you can work on meaningful backend challenges. The key is picking projects where you'll naturally encounter and solve the problems that backend engineers face daily, rather than building yet another CRUD API. When it comes to interviews, having deep knowledge about fewer technologies and being able to discuss real problems you've solved will always beat surface-level familiarity with everything on a job posting.I'm on the team that built [interview AI assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate those tricky technical interview questions where you need to demonstrate your problem-solving approach, not just recite memorized answers.",

I would hate to switch positions and then be hit with a mass layoff or something but life is all about taking risks too. Do you have any keywords that would help filter C/C++ jobs?

Nine years of development work has given you problem-solving skills, debugging expertise, and the ability to work with legacy systems that many companies desperately need. The fact that you've built end-to-end applications shows you understand the full development lifecycle, which is valuable even if you haven't dealt with massive scale. Desktop applications often involve complex business logic and performance considerations that translate well to other domains.The key is reframing your story during interviews. Focus on the technical challenges you've solved, the business impact of your work, and your ability to learn new technologies quickly. When system design questions come up, be upfront about your experience level but walk through your thought process methodically. Companies often care more about how you think through problems than whether you've personally managed a million-user system.

Stick with that. You might be in the least in demand field in the world, but as long as you are the best in the world at it you will have a better time than the unemployed person who is bad at a high demand field.",

Search for \"OOP fundamentals,\" \"SOLID principles explained,\" \"JavaScript/Python/Java interview questions,\" and \"software design patterns\" on YouTube and you'll find plenty of content. Focus on understanding the why behind these concepts rather than just memorizing definitions, because interviewers love to ask follow-up questions that test your actual comprehension.
