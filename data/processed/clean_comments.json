        "body": "Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s. I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:First and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. **Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. Second, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. Third, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. IMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",

Im being serious this is a \"pub\" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.This industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. When I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.Compute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.With this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.It does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.Modelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.Id love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?Anyway... your not alone...Do you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive. So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.They *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity. And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason. But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult. So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.But that doesn't mean nobody is. It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",

When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!Nowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. I guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. I’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).Edit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff. While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions. This is not as much a concern now. \\- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.

I did this a while back with the snowflake query log so I could understand our costs better. Try to get to a point where writing the SQL to answer your questions flows naturally and quickly. The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.You'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few placesFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)Websites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.For performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in. For snowflake I found some articles on [https://articles.analytics.today/](https://articles.analytics.today/) helpful. But you'll need to find sources relevant to you.",

We're all ice cream (DE) enjoyers here.. some people like the chocolate flavor, others prefer strawberry… and I think of all this as AI having taken some flavors off the market.

Unfortunately we're currently living through a period of FAFO, where it's normal to tear down status quo, including gov't regulations for novelty because going viral is where the money is. The same thing happened with the blockchain craze, and the people who understood the tech were right to point out that all you need was immutable dbs to solve most of the use cases that were used to hype the trending tech. I feel the same as you do, but companies will need to learn the hard way, because the world of VCs have convinced companies large and small that the only way to be worth more or to enhance productivity is to jump to the next novel tech that is going viral - This works great for start ups attempting to pump up their valuations, but not so great for companies that are larger with processes and governance in place. This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. You're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital. It's all a game, but that does not mean that the pleasure you gained from building data pipelines no longer gives you satisfaction. You just need to find other corps that are mindful of assessing premature tech before jumping head first into the latest and greatest - there is a reason companies like Apple and Costco maintained their lead this long.",

Thankfully they put a ton of work into the docs and Scout is my dad now. The clever scheduling options have and the ease of deployment with compose has been the highlight so far. I think this tool to solves real DE problems and not just “look at my 2000 connectors”.",

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.The main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule. Dagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. I ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.Dagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.Testing is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. Can write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.To conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks. Data pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",

I am not a big graphdb person so I don't know, but have built semantic models the other way and had mixed results with AI.In the end though the challenge for me was more about semantics and synonyms than anything else. In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business. I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question. I could make it work if you ask it things in exactly the right way, but that's not the point of a conversational tool like an LLM.",

I don't think winning the competition alone is going to help you without a strong portfolio of other projects, but it would make for good essay/statement of interest material to describe why you're looking for a career pivot.In my experience, unless they've already made the job description with an existing candidate in mind, colleges and universities are good places to start. They aren't super fixated on production-level experience, usually have some super passionate people, and chill workloads. You could start by looking for jobs at local colleges or something like HigherEd Jobs. Best of luck!",

One task that extracts, one that loads and one that transforms. Of course this is highly dependent and it helps to be pragmatic. In some instances you'll need to break these patterns. For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.For example:- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).Then on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).We'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",

All it takes is a single command to add a column to a table, it’s really not hard, especially with the small volumes you are working with. And there are tools like Alembic which someone’s already mentioned to help you version, test and deploy these sorts of changes easily and reliably.So “my Data is going to change and evolve” is really not a good reason to use a document store like mongo.The use case for a document store is really when your data is literally arbitrary. By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there’s no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.Even if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.But from what you’ve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases. These things will likely cause you pain down the track that is much worse than what you think you’re avoiding by not having to worry about schema evolution.",

From there, it could be either consumed by spark (Databricks, etc.) or you can use any of the emyriad parquet readers to push it to databases, etc. but you don't have to worry about enforcing the schema or data types, coercion, remapping columns or data, etc. because it will have already been taken care of in a standard way.",

The org culture and turmoil is causing you to second-guess. There are many options here, but I think if you leave this organization for a better DE team, you'll find career satisfaction.

        "body": "Firstly, you are asking a good question. You're trying to get a benchmark and basically a decent KPI. Secondly, the answer to your question hardly exists. I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. Myself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. For a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. I learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",

Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.Regarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of specific \"data engineering\" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It’s the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn’t matter which one—AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it’s the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.If you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts. Everything will make much more sense once you have these basics down.",

Separately, you can research whatever systems your team is using and break down by categories:1. SQL: Learn how to write SQL queries (use documentation for whatever language you're using and look up videos for that specific langauge).2. Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).I would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go. You will also need to understand what the modeling and data in your pipelines represent. Being able to explain data to the business is equally important to technical knowledge of how to store and manage data.",

My guess is spark looked at the code submitted and calculated that it's more efficient to run it with a smaller number of workers rather than scaling out (maybe because the data isnt huge so it's faster to do it all on one node?). Spark may be wrong about this since you're using gzip files so maybe try converting/saving to parquet first and then running your data processing on the parquet files and see what happens. Gzip typically takes more time to decompress so breaking the job into two parts (decompressing in part 1 and transforming data in part 2) could help triage the issue better. Do you see performance gains when using more nodes? UDFs typically aren't great for performance, what does the UDF do specifically? I've found the built in functions are pretty good at doing what you want if you're a little creative, plus they're going to be faster. Also if you're using >30 withColumn statements that could be slowing down performance a bit since i believe each one makes spark recalculate the logical plan, so you could try using withColumns instead.",

Sit down with key business people and find the most important questions they want answering.Then, find what data sources you'll need to answer those questions. In the beginning, this is typically financial reporting / sales related. How much money are we making, etc.2. Focus on delivering these core information sets at first, before doing ANYTHING more fancy. Give the business the ability to answer their super basic, but essential questions.3. Data stack:Azure is fine, but i'd personally reccomend AWS or GCP.Similar with Databricks - it's fine and will work, but they specialise in data science, you're probably better off with BigQuery or Snowflake if the focus is analytics.I'd avoid PowerBI and use Tableau. Or, if you can afford it, Looker.Open source tooling is great. I'd highly reccomend dbt for the data transformation layer. And airflow for orchestration.Data ingestion, as you've mentioned, as a one person team. managed pipelines are a good place to start: airbyte, fivetran or stitch. Just be conscious of costs here as they can rack up, versus custom implementations (using lambdas, ECS etc).Feel free to dm me any questions!",

There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.In both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. Once you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.However, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)2. `Arc` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)5. `PrimitiveArray` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)6. `ArrayRef = Arc` (trait object used in generic contexts)So, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.In **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \\- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'The result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.The point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation. Regardless, Arrow is brilliant and it's incredible what the team has achieved.",

Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems. I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point. Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions. Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest. There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT. This is needed to understand signals, etc. They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other. It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",

        "body": "Thanks for the excellent link.Patient_Magazine has a solid answer. It’s not just in pharma. OT is typically an underinvested and unappreciated area in technology and staffing. It’s like the opposite of sales lol.The software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.Also, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there’s not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.Good news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it’s not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there’s a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.Hopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.One tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group. Usually I’ve found this less of a technology issue but more of a perception and priorities issue.",

Fix it once in the layer, not everywhere downstream.* Put in basic checks/thresholds (like “do we have 90% of records?”) so bad data gets flagged instead of silently flowing through.* Use lineage/monitoring so you know if data is just late or actually broken.",

If a column was renamed the data is needed but needs to be mapped to original column name, but at the time of ingestion we cannot determine a column was renamed. There could have been a column added and another one deleted etc. if a new field was added and everything else is the same we can detect it and ignore it in this case, if a column was deleted and everything else is the same we can also detect it, but may has impact if the data was needed for a report. the report is now working with either stale data (in the Gold layer) or could even break the report (depends on business logic).

We also took part in **MWC Barcelona in both 2023 and 2024,** and while it is a massive event, it offered solid technical content around AI, IoT and digital transformation with live demos and case studies.For developer-focused tracks, **Berlin Buzzwords** is a good choice if you’re into data engineering and search technologies, and the **Data Innovation Summit in Stockholm** usually brings very practical case studies. Since you mentioned **apidays in London**, that one is definitely worth checking out too because it covers APIs and AI with a good balance of technical content and ecosystem discussions.",

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. My last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads. After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. If I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema. Then its the best way to manage a staging environment that manages the history. If you have a number of the source schema ready then it's best to clarify what your manager's expectations are. What is your environment ?",

It is open source and very easy to install. It also handles schema evolution very gracefully as every new ingestion creates a new version of the table inside Tabsdata. Hence, you will have ready access to previous versions in case anything breaks downstream.",

Or can I just, lets say, write a json to represent the order and send it directly to the pipeline, keeping the production schema only with `customers` and `products` tables? Would that be too far from what actually happens in real scenarios? I'm afraid I may be oversimplifying things.I'm guessing that, in the \"real world\", an e-commerce needs to write the customer orders first in its production database to keep track of stuff similar to what I described in the last paragraph of my post. Should I take that into account for my project? If yes, for how long the data is kept in production? After an order is considered *closed*, can it be instantly deleted from the database to live only in the warehouse?",

Much more memory efficient, and the API is much nicer to work with. Read the Polars user guide, but maybe start this part first: https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/migration/pandas/PS: Don't depend on external software, if possible. The fewer systems you need to rely on the better. Software maintained by others will always magically break, or change in some incompatible way. That doesn't mean *never* use said software, but try to keep your reliance low.",

Well, it depends ;-)Writing data to tempdb is a physical operation, which is costly if you do it for a lot of data. If you already have data in an indexed table that's optimized for your workload, it would be a poor decision to write it to a temp table.If you can subset a (relatively) small amount of data from your big, indexed table, and put it in a temp table, it may be worth it. Especially if what comes next is a long and complex query that would otherwise be hard for the optimizer to build a proper plan for, if it were to run on a big table.Generally, write operations are slow and resource-heavy. That includes writes to tempdb. You should avoid them, unless later performance gain outweight the cost of writing the data.",

Instead of only handling redaction at the dashboard/report level, I’m trying to enforce field-level visibility dynamically at runtime as data moves between pipeline stages (e.g., from an ingestion job → enrichment → analytics).For example, I might want:* Stage 1 (raw ingestion) to see full PII* Stage 2 (transform) to only see masked or tokenized fields* Stage 3 (analytics or inference) to selectively rehydrate fields based on role or policySo it’s a more granular form of policy-based access control during the transformation phase not just reporting. Quicksight-level controls are useful at the end of the pipeline, but I’m trying to catch privacy risks earlier in-flight, while still supporting rehydration for authorized consumers.Have you seen any approaches like this upstream of the BI layer?",

That way, workflows that don’t need PHI don’t see it and the few that do can securely access it in a controlled context.Curious if you have ever wanted to support something more flexible (like downstream masking or field-level reveal)?

Not everything fits neatly into them. Example, you need to move data from on-prem to cloud, data needs encryption at rest and in transit, how is DBT and Airflow helping? You can maybe orchestrate some in Airflow but actually nope, on-prem is behind firewall with local connectivity and limited egress only, no inbound connection for security and it cannot be exposed to a cloud based Airflow instance due to security team demands. How do you get the data where it's needed? You get into data engineering by starting with analytics roles and learning how the data lifecycle works and gaining experience, you develop your knowledge of the ways things work and progress from there. You wouldn't expect to leave school and immediately start neurosurgery, you'd work as a regular doctor and specialize over years before becoming a neurosurgeon. Its the same idea.",

Fabric is what Microsoft is pushing & Databricks is much better than Synapse. Both are better futureproof options, with many more features. If you can try to sway them one of thode wats way (or simply bring in a MS/Databricks representative to do it for you).Make sure you know that DBT will not work in Synapse on `spark SQL`. You need to use the Microsoft SQL flavor, which differs quite a lot (it gets weird) & can get quite expensive. On Databricks (and I believe also Fabric) spark SQL does work. Also since you're in governement. Spatial/geo support is very limited in this SQL flavour. I know Databricks (& again probably Fabric) has better support.",

Fabric wasn't available in GCC yet last I checked, so depending on the country / government organization in question and the project, might not be an option yet. We're working on it.

After a POC, if you decide the inbuilt orchestration of Synapse then moving to Airflow is reasonable although starting with Airflow is begging for this to be a much more arduous project than it needs to be. If you know 100% you are going to be using Airflow in the future then sure use Airflow.Spark pools will do this for you. I'd avoid data flow where possible and use native spark because data flows are quite literally double the cost of straight spark. People absolutely hate it on Reddit although I use notebooks as they can be instantly inserted into Synapse pipelines with the very string caveat that all spark code in notebooks within a pipeline has to be written as if it's regular code i.e. No bollocks.",

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.* Make debugging cheap. Seed data easily, add local tracing, keep a scratch REPL file, enable frontend debug toggles, dump full state with diffs, and add helpers to jump the UI into target states.* On a team, ask questions early. Do the five minute search first, then get unblocked fast.* Protect shipping cadence. Aim for quick deploys, low bug rates, fast cross-team handoffs, reusable patterns, and lean process. Cut the 10 percent of a feature that eats 50 percent of the time. * Treat slow shipping as a problem to root cause.* Learn to code review. a code review is an invitation for feedback and to get another pair of eyes on your work. To catch issues before it goes to QA.",

So is reading introductory material that's nonspecific, verbose, and has no immediate connection to something you actually care about. What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.Instead of thinking about \"all the cool stuff\", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first. But you don't need these smaller things to be completely unrelated to your project, which is however what you'll get by following standard tutorials.No one dreams of making \"hello world\", but even something incredibly complex can be turned into something simple by removing almost all of the details first. That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the \"real thing\".Even if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn. You need to find out and understand what you don't in order to get further, and you'll automatically know what to ignore (because it doesn't help you go in this direction).If you need specific examples, feel free to elaborate on your project ideas. But don't try to follow popular guidance if it isn't working. Most teachers, and the learning resources they create, are bad and won't work for a large proportion of students. There's no universal solution and no replacement for intrinsic motivation. If learning isn't fun on a regular basis, you'll struggle and not everyone can just \"power through\" until it \"gets fun\". That's not a failure, just a mismatch in strategy.The good news is that the beginning is by far the most difficult part of learning programming. Once you've attained some level of mastery, motivation comes much easier since being good at something is inherently rewarding.",

I was gonna use the database to then build a fake bookstore web app. Pretty sweet, right?Well as soon as I get the database and start poking around, I find that despite having the title and author of a book be the database keys, I still had duplicates. And so, without knowing what I was doing with SQL at all, I tried to filter out the duplicates, and ended up dropping all of the data from the database except the titles and authors. The data was ruined and I was so mad at myself. Never made that bookstore website!Fortunately I haven't made any major mistakes professionally yet. But my time is coming, I'm sure of it.",

With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are \"Turing complete\" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. Programming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.It is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.In Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to \"modularize\" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.Also SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would \"hello world\" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me. I would much rather maintain the Python version of such a tool.",

Yes, I read that you're a CSE grad, but you need the experience and especially the feeling and confidence that comes with it.And then learn to read documentation and references instead of googling. Your code looks like Python. So go ahead and read through the whole Python reference. You don't need to memorize it, and you can skip through stuff, but make sure you read all the function names and at least a little bit of what they do, and it will help you a lot to get some confidence and a starting point if you're looking for something. After that, pick some \"most used libraries\" (feel free to google it) and read a few examples for each, or the reference docs if you can afford to.There's no easy way, you have to go ahead and invest the time and brain cells. Again, it's not about memorizing everything, but having read stuff at least once will give you a better feeling for a language, what to find where, where to start, and some confidence.Good luck, I think the thing you're most lacking right now is confidence, and there ain't no better way to establish that than knowing that you worked hard.",

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The OS is not **written** in binary code. But because it is **compiled** to binary code, which the CPU directly understands, there doesn't need to be any other layer \"underneath\" it.The compiler, too, can be written in a high-level language which is compiled to machine code.> Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer? Yes, this is basically it. You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.For instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.Then you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.Once you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [\"self-hosting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).But remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were \"bootstrapped\" over the last 70 years or so. Once you have a self-hosting compiler, you no longer need all of the previous layers of bootstrapping.",

It's what the CPU understands, by definition.Generally the process goes something like this:1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.Introductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is \"compiled\" or \"interpreted\" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's \"interpreted\" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.A lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about \"free-standing\" versus \"hosted\" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.But the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be \"undefined\" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.Also you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the \"OS\" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it. IIRC Android 13 was the first version to be less than 50% C and C++. (Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)The point is it's all machine code in the end. The only question is if the language is accustomed to letting you do practically everything the machine code will allow, or whether you would be fighting the language's built-in assumptions to implement the OS's most basic functionality for yourself.",

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.In this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.When you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says \"run the machine code at this address.\" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.The operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.Even the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask \"well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?\" and that would be a great question. The answer is a system called \"bootstrapping\" in which, yes, somebody had to actually write out some machine code by hand at the very start of all this.",

But people don’t actually write in it because it’s impossible to read and understand. Assembly is a human readable, near one-to-one translation of binary which gives programmers direct control over every bit of data and where it goes. It’s not the same as a programming language, because you’re not programming instructions, but manipulating data. Compiled programming languages like C, C++, and Java take a different approach, where instead of directly manipulating the data programmers are given access to more abstracted tools, like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and nodes. Complied languages like C still give you more control over the hardware then interpreted languages like Python, but there’s still more abstraction then you’d find in Assembly. But in the end, it’s all complied down into machine code. For clarity, compiled languages are not a step above Assembly in the sense that complied languages are complied into Assembly which is then complied into Machine Code. They’re two different branches of programming with different levels of abstraction, but both lead back to the same root. Now compilers are generally written through a technique known as bootstrapping, where the first version of a compiler is written in one language, and then the second version is rewritten in the language it’s meant to compile.For example, the first C compiler was written in Assembly, but all subsequent versions were written in C.

The C code will get complied down into machine code and run fine.That's broadly correct.One of the nice parts about C is that the language grammar is completely divorced from the standard library. This is not true for C++, but it's not that difficult to replace the portions of the language grammar that are linked to to the standard library (eg, the *new* keyword).It is entirely possible to implement some of the C standard library functions in format that is suitable for use in kernel space. For example, most kernels will have memory allocators similar to malloc (Linux has kmalloc()) and print to a kernel console.>But if OSes don't need to be written in Assembly or even binary, what does? Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The C programming language was designed to allow the Unix operating system to be easily ported to many different machine architectures. Unix Version 7 was the first version of Unix that was easily portable. It was ported from PDP-11 to Motorola 68K, x86, VAX, and more. Approximately 98% of the operating system kernel was written in C, the remaining 2% was platform specific assembly. One of the nice parts about C is that it easily integrates with assembly.>Are compilers written in machine code?Sometimes, but not always.C is an evolution of B. B is a stripped down and modified version of BCPL.The first C compiler was written in B. Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.The first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS? Some fundamental code on the processor itself?Processor microcode. That's a different beast all to itself that programmers rarely ever need to worry about.BIOS is just a name for the startup routine and machine interface used by IBM PCs. It's usually specific to a particular motherboard and has the ultimate objective of finding and loading an operating system bootloader. BIOS has been depreciated in favor of UEFI. All modern operating systems generally shutdown firmware services and make little use of them, preferring their own drivers instead.>Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer?C code that is compiled as a part of an operating system kernel and C code that is compiled as a part of a userspace application are no different. instructions are instructions.",

        "body": "A couple notes about system calls and machine code since self hosting compilers were already explained.OSes don’t use system calls because they are the subject of system calls. They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you’re doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.On machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it’s a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It’s more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It’s the only thing the cpu actually understands.Also, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there’s a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you’re using is the standard “gcc -o2 [whatever]” that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you’d like to see it, you can. Btw, I know this because I had a friend who told me that if I really wanted to learn Linux I’d do this. He was wrong about that.",

I’d advise staying clear of any niche areas like AI/ML/Computer Vision/Cybersecurity/Data Science/etc. These will require either advanced degrees, or way more *relevant* years of experience than it would take you to go back for an advanced degree.1. Don’t count on finding a remote opportunity right out of the gate. These exist, even for junior role, but you might be sitting on the bench indefinitely if these are the only roles you’re applying to.2. Building on the previous point, apply to in-office roles, hybrid roles, local roles, those that may need relocation, and those that aren’t “programming” jobs but are relevant enough to let you make a transition into a “programming” job. Who cares if you don’t have the money to relocate or if your local job market pays peanuts, experience is more important than money for your early career, as long as you have a signed offer, make whatever financial decisions you have to do to make it work.3. If you have a legit disability preventing you from working in-office, then I don’t have any advice, I’m unfamiliar with that process4.

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.It's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.Lastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up. If you dislike maths I'd have a good think about whether you dislike actually puzzling over it or whether your education system has constantly thrown you challenges beyond your comfort level and never given you the chance and support to address your weaker spots.Some actual learning advice / resources:On the maths front, Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud is my top pick for a zero to hero maths book if it's of interest as it really starts from the fundamentals.If you like Python, automate the boring stuff with python is a fantastic resource, available as a website, courses on Udemy, a book, whatever floats your boat.Outside of that, honestly just do some coding puzzles online. Codingbat, codingames, codewars and loads more. Leetcode is there too but is probably best left for later once you're feeling up to it.3 months to do some well directed self study is gold. Take it steady and I'm sure you'll see some real progress.",

Key is to stay consistent, build logic-> stay practical for good understanding, note- If u feel stuck, go online look for the code no problem but the thing is you have to ask why why did person use this instead of this.eg: we can print this\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* simply as print(\\*); but for easy and quick we row 5;for i in range(1, rows + 1):print(\"\\*\" \\* i)",

I went the opposite route and learned the programming first and then had to go back and learn all the theory (don’t recommend this route). I wouldn’t stress it tbh, and if you’re dead set on starting to learn a language then probably start with Python as it’ll be easier to at least read and comprehend while learning the basics. The nice thing about programming languages is once you understand programming and know a language well, picking up other ones is a lot less daunting and is generally just a matter of learning syntax and any language specific things (this varies by language). There plenty of free courses on YouTube through free code camp.

Also, another piece of advice, find a language and stick with it for awhile. When I first learned programming, I kept agonizing on which specific language to learn, but the reality is that really doesn't matter all that much. Most of the concepts you master in one language will translate to another.Oh and 17 is not late to start coding, I didn't start to learn how to code more than a tiny bit until I was in my late 20s. I'd say you're doing quite well :)Edit: One other thing to note. You might find in college you might grow to like math more btw. When I was in high school, I also hated math a lot. What I realized later on, was that a lot of that was how it was taught in my high school. A lot of my math classes in high school were just straight memorization of formulas and I despised every moment of it. Once I got to college though, I actually learned how to think mathematically, how those formulas are derived and proven, and learned that math is actually quite beautiful.

And when a program runs in machine code, it becomes much, much simpler to understand how it calls other programs that are also in machine code. Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.But the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a \"calling convention\", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.Look into \"calling conventions\" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",

This is a primary reason for CSV, XML, JSON, and other data formats. Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)If a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called. Different languages have different calling conventions.And when information is transferred over a network, that has its own problems. Often it's done with a text based format like JSON, but Protobufs are designed for the purpose. In the olden days, Sun invented XDR (eXternal Data Representation) and SunRPC, which did much the same thing but a lot less efficiently.In general we call this problem Serialization and Deserialization, and solutions to the problem have been introduced constantly for decades.",

Interpreted languages like Python eventually have the interpreter call the system, and Java uses bytecode, but in the end, the bytecode interpreter agin calls the very same function in the system.If it was any other way, in the worst case, files on a disk written with Java could not be read by C.There is another layer to this. If you don’t use the file system, but want to access data in memory, I.e. have a single app that is written in two or more languages, it gets very complex. Every language usually has an interface library that converts its internal data representation to C. C is the lowest level language that is not specific to a processor.",

I was at a complete and utter loss, I had no idea where to start. But... the assignment was broken down to small parts. Ask for and take user input. Store the letter choice. Check if the letter has already been used. Pick a word from a dictionary. Check if the letter is in the word etc... It took me far too long to learn that the assignment wasn't about a hangman game, it was a lesson showing how to split big problems in to small ones. Every step was laughably easy and suddenly I had a silly little game to show for it. If you ask me to build almost anything, I'll be at a loss. But I have got a bit better at biting off small chunks and doing those. As another poster said, pseudo code is good. I tend to start fairly high level, and I may even write outlines of what I'll actually need. Load Dictionary from locationPick random word from dictionaryGet user inputStore users letterCheck if letter is in wordIf yestake letter out of word?If notincrement count (decrement towards zero?) (I needed to initialise a counter somewhere) (if the letter had previously been used I should warn the user, and not count the pick) Even if I do those out of order I can make some progress. I'm working on a personal project now to build random playlists from my music library, based on genre, artist, and whatever parameters I can think of. I have *no idea* how to do that. But I know I need to start with reading my music library. And I don't want to do that every time I run, so I want to store that somewhere and rerun periodically (either to a file or database). So I need to think about whether I want to write data to file or database, and figure out how to do that. And I want to take in some parameters for the playlist, but I can do that from a config file of some sort for now. And I'll want to pick a set of tracks which match my params - can't be that hard. Then I need to randomly pick some, and maybe randomise the order. Hmm, maybe I should try and limit the number of tracks from any one artist, or maximise it - that may be a nice parameter. I'll need to know the standard playlist format. Etc etc.Suddenly the whole project seems like something you could do in a weekend. Which makes me wonder why I haven't gotten around to it in the past year... although in that time I have written some code that gives me some nice data on my music library, and lets me do some housekeeping and cleanup on it.",

        "body": "That doesn't make much sense, because there's no single cognitive ability that would allow one to program successfully without being able to understand enough to create your own solutions (however poor they may be at first).If you're talking about actual deficiencies, like those in working memory (e.g., if one has ADHD it is often impaired) then that's a very real challenge, but not one you couldn't work around. I know excellent programmers who are technically learning-disabled, they just take more time and are slower but they can still somehow do if after they gained enough practice.I think it would be worth investigating what forms of representation for information you prefer in other contexts. Usually, a combination of material works better than any specific one, but there are large individual differences. If you're using code as a reference, that is entirely different than using code to understand a concept. In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)2. \"How to do X\" guides and other instructions: Complete \"recipes\" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graphSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.The second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. For some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.Finally, there is a difference between \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes \"forgets\" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.Personally, I found that \"low IQ\" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so. But that still doesn't prevent you from doing it on paper or using any other medium, and you might find that someone who seems \"stupid\" is actually quite adept at visualizing graphically in their head instead, or they're great at teaching the material to others and thereby learn it themselves, etc.I would assume that people with severe cognitive disabilities who are \"brainess\", as you put it, have neither the capacity nor motivation to ask for programming help on Reddit. So my best guess would be a mismatch in approach or missing skillsets, not a lack of general problem-solving ability. Abstract problem solving is more difficult than doing it in context; you could try reframing the problem so it represents specific instances.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.For another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.Usually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.Just as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.Edit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

They just need to specify those fields and will get a predictable response.If your function additionally relies on implicit, mutable state, e.g. certain fields being a certain value at certain times that can be updated by anything anywhere, including randomly or by the mere passage of time, then it's way more difficult to use the function correctly because you don't control the inputs directly.No one's saying \"never have state\".

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.Statefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.OOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.Statelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.At least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

        "body": "2 first: Objects are *data and their operations*. State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.1 and 3: Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.Let us back up a little: Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data. At all scales, this is what a program is. From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output. The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part. This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected: Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.This is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance. They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.Now, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches. This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example: In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*. If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).It is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.Some programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state. With a resulting large amount of bugs. It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).The graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs. Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all. But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way. It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.That minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.So, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program. OOP is by definition state and operations.BUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully. And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.Ed: I forgot to address the side-effects problem. State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state. That's the entire point of functions on persistent state. Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

        "body": "Fair warning, this is going to be very long.I prefer the Black Box Method to writing code. I think a lot of developers do this without really thinking about it. No matter what the program is, you should be able to break it down into some smaller steps, some important operations that need to happen for the program to work. The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.For example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?1. Read the input file2. Update the relevant data filesSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out): def main(): parse_input_file() update_data_files()And the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like \"Parsing input file...\" and \"Updating data files...\" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.Anyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, \"how do we know which file to read?\", \"what is the format of this input file?\", \"how should we store the data that we read?\". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.For the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.So, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:a. Split the line using a comma as the delimeterb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with itc. Append that tuple to the arrayYour program might look something like this now: def parse_input_file(): parsed_data = [] input_file = prompt_input_file() if exists(input_file) for line in input_file.readlines(): data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line) if data_tuple: # make sure data exists parsed_data.append(data_tuple) return parsed_dataAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function: def main(): parsed_data = parse_input_file() if parsed_data: # make sure data exists update_data_files(parsed_data)Note that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.No matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.That got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey! Hope you become a kickass developer someday!",

        "body": "At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.The second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language are built on 3 concepts:\\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different forms of repetition)Most lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.For example: If you see the word \"if\" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching as \"if\" implies there are at least two options to handle. \"As long as\" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.In the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.pressDoorHandle()openDoor()enterRoom()closeDoor()Of course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.Of course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.When programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\\# For each pdf-document do:\\# Open pdf-document\\# Extract values with a regular expressions\\# write them into table\\# close documentAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).There are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck! EDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important. Use any language you want. It's more about understanding the concepts rather than the language.",

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don’t waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?I don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.My advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.In 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.I'd add:\\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",

Yes, controlling your side effects are important, but unless you're working in a functional language, things like printing and logging can be ignored 99% of the time, and the better visibility you gain into how your code functions is well worth it. If you're working in object oriented, sometimes you need a void method that operates via side effects, and that's okay. Not everything makes sense to have an output.

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.Sure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc. For example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.For example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different. In async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity. Limiting stuff like this requires a bit more thought when creating the system, but saves a lot of time on maintaining, debugging, and refactoring later.",

Also, half the point of OOP is that systems are dynamic, so having all inputs passed as parameters might be shooting oneself in the foot. I would slightly amend that to say “minimal global parameters.” Otherwise I agree, though. I like being able to match what goes in with what goes out, not having to guess which method or global parameter caused an exception because, idk, wrong type or something. I used to get so frustrated as a beginner with divide by zero exceptions and be like HOW??? WHERE? It would often be something external, and cleaning up doesn’t hurt anything. But you also sacrifice functionality. I just don’t like documentation/commenting, but you can solve a lot of problems like nan exceptions when comments draw your attention to the workflow. I honestly (besides commenting) don’t understand why I don’t have more exceptions than I do other than just building some good habits over time.Absolutely agree on unnecessary side effects. I do keep a lot of stdout printing at first so I can focus attention on the flow, but if it works, it works, and I delete all that stuff. You need it for debugging. IDE’s catch exceptions. But just because something doesn’t return an error doesn’t mean it does what you want it to do. But if it works, it works, and you don’t need a lot of side effects beyond that.Overall, this is a great list! I’m gonna copy this and keep it handy.",

It all depends on whether you do OO programming.

You want logging, don't you? This approach to writing functions is more from a functional programming language view where functions should be side-effect free, but honestly, it's a pain to accomplish that.You can strive for it, but many don't seem to care about side effects. The ones you hear more are avoiding the use of global variables (passing stuff through parameters).It would be nice if certain languages could return tuples instead of single values.

Far easier to get work and work-life balance is usually better (because at least when you're working tons of OT, you're getting paid for it!).I don't think software development is a total deadend right now, but as just a career to get into for the money this isn't it anymore. If you're so passionate about software you can't imagine doing anything else, got get a 4 year CS degree, an internship, push hard and I'm sure you'll be successful. But if it is the potential of better pay and work from home...well, better pay only happens if you can actually get a job, which is hard right now, and remote work is becoming more of a rarity again.",

You go through the steps of installing Python which is good. You explained why you need to say `python -V` with a capital `V` because, frankly, a lowercase and uppercase V look similar. I think the only other part you could have added is to make sure there's a space after `python` and no space after the minus sign.The text editor part feels rushed. For example, you choose to use PyCharm. There's an installation process for that as well, which you skipped. Then, how does one get PyCharm to run the right version of Python.You gloss over *what* a text editor is. Why can't you use Word or Google Docs to write a program? You could say an IDE is a text editor plus a lot more, but we won't get into the details.There is the idea of writing code, then running code, and while you do write and run code, it might make sense to explain the process more explicitly.There are questions left unanswered or partly answered.* What is a programming language?* What is a program?* How do you write a program? (Explain what a text editor is and the first step is to edit your code)* What does it mean to run a program and how do you run a program?The part that starts to get rushed (because you wanted to do this in \"10\" minutes) is the actual Python code itself.I feel the entire section could have been slowed down. As a former teacher, it went over concepts quickly. I know the basics *seem* easy, but they aren't that easy. Even simple stuff like \"what is a variable\". What does it mean to assign a variable? What is a conditional? What is a condition?Of course, at this pace, it would not be a ten minute video. This is the problem with teaching really introductory programming. You end up explaining stuff that seems really obvious to you, but you discover that those things are *not* obvious. They're so obvious that you don't even mention it because you can't imagine someone wouldn't get it.But still, really well edited. For what you intended to do, it looks great. Whether it gets someone to learn enough Python in ten minutes, I'm not sure. I believe a few will get it, but most might be lost?",

But didn't want to paint a single painting until he could make sure his first attempt would come out completely photorealistic.",

All that exists is extensive research. If you research, if you check blogs, articles, you will quite likely get enough understanding to do what you want.Even if you were \"learning things wrong\", you'd still be *learning*, you'd still be *improving yourself*.In programming (as in basically everything else) there is rarely any absolute \"right\" or \"wrong\". There is mostly \"better\" or \"worse\", where \"worse\" is still far better than nothing.If you just worry about \"wrong\", you won't get very far. Be curious. Experiment. Try things. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how you could optimize it, once you've got it working and if you see that there is room for optimization.A good approach is that whenever you learn some major subjects (e.g. arrays -> lists -> dictionaries/maps) you revisit your old code and see if you could use any of the new found knowledge there. This will not only show you how much you have improved, but also force you to rethink and to try different approaches.",

That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.Now why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots of copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.But there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).And you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo that input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.And even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing. No copy and paste, no shortcuts.Using that process you will be learning to write code and learning to read code. Add to that reading a good book on your programming language and you'll be well on your way to becoming a good programmer.",

Take time to read documentation. Like literally block a few hours and do the reading. It's work just like typing code is work. Close your AI tabs. Writing code, especially code that you know the structure of, is a restful activity that lets your mind go through the project. letting something generate your code makes it harder to know what is going on in the project and it pushes you into constant \"debug someone elses mess\" territory. ownership of code starts with having written it. And since it takes time, this time you can spend on thinking how you would like to fit this into the project.Also don't feel bad about starting code over after having tried something out. I keep separate browser windows open, each with their own tabs. one window has all my testing work (pages where I try out the application, pages where I have data I need to enter like test creditcards and the like, or the jira issue I am currently working on. (open in new tab is essential when you use jira, the new interface is a laggy POS))And focus on the one task. If someone comes to you with an extra problem / a new problem: that is unfortunate for them that they have this problem. It is however, not your problem. Don't context switch until you are finished with what you are working on. If something is important enough to drop everything then it is simply a matter for the person interrupting you to talk to your manager __and__ the person whose ticket you are working on. They can arrange with them that you drop their task. Often this is enough of a roadblock that they are willing to wait.

Research on your own and start somewhere. For your level and usecase it should be something cheap/free without the possibility of draining your life savings if you make a mistake. Look into a VPS and docker \\- Scaling? A lot of the things in the cloud these days autoscale in their own ways. But don't worry about this at all atm. You won't build anything that needs serious scaling for a long time probably. \\- Security? This one is kinda the odd one out. Security is a CORE part of any app, not just an afterthought. Another reason why you are not \"fairly proficient\". This needs to be understood and studied on a core level. \\- Architecture? This can mean anything \\- How to choose a tech stack? You are not really in a position to choose if all you know is Django. And thats also fine. Focus on Django for now. Switch up the db or some dependencies depending on your needs maybe.

You start with something small and manageable. You can then incrementally add to that. So for example you build a simple application, then host it, extend it to use authentication and integrate with something like google. Add something like accessing a database and learn how to deploy the database. This is just an example of how to build out what started as a simple application.The first time you do something, it may not be the best, but you will learn. The next time you can try changing things to compare until you find a method that works for you. There is no magic formula; there are good practices and standards which you will pick up as you explore, but ultimately, you need to develop what works for you.",

The cool thing about the tech field is that if you find yourself asking \"surely there's a better way to do this?\", the answer is yes 99.95% of the time. Stumbling into friction, problems, and headaches makes it incredibly easy to ask more specific questions and search for a deeper understanding, as opposed to just following a guide. A great way to write programs is to solve problems you run into.For instance, I work at a printer dealership. The software we use for tracking service tickets is 26 years old, takes several minutes to boot up, is insanely expensive, and is unintuitive and generally clunky. Maybe I'm audacious, but I became convinced I could do better. So now I'm writing a tool that does it better. It's been months and I'm nowhere near done, because I keep learning and refactoring and learning and refactoring... which is how I hit my stride. I write something, I go \"man, this sucks. maybe there's an easier way...\" and then I find an easier way. That's how you learn.Only exception here is security. That you probably wanna get right first try. :P",

It allows you to provide code that uses or conforms to certain interfaces to customise its behaviour to make your game. Types, events, utilities, all the hard physics math, all the hard graphics math, all the finicky parsing code for data formats, the platform layer that takes input and interfaces with the OS, etc... all done for you.SDL describes itself as a library, and I agree having used it extensively. You bring the game/sim loop, and basically everything else. You call it to get input, or ask about events, or render something (if you're using it to render). It's basically a cross-platform platform layer that you can build a game engine (or whatever you like) on top of.

        "body": "Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one). The best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project. The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit. Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound. We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else. The key is the input. What a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground). This is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code). The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***. A library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox. It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks. A good example of this in JS is JQuery. They are typically very specific uses and very tiny. You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine. SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer. A game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic. Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware. In general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them. They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic. Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer. You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)Frameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end \"the angular way\" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",

Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.For your current problem: What does being a Palindrome mean? It means that a word read in both directions is the same, like *racecar* or *RADAR*.How could you detect this? By checking the original vs. the reversed word.How could you reverse a word? There are a couple ways, one of which is to loop over each character in a word and to push the current character into an array from the front.You could also just simply concatenate the letters with the current letter being added at the front of the reversed string.Last, you need to compare the original and reversed strings.What definitely is important as well is to *sanitize* the case, e.g. make everything uppercase or lowercase.",

At what step in your process did you realize MADMAN was not a palindrome?Now can you write a general procedure for doing this? Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.If you want to get really \"serious\" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to \"stress test\" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an \"industrial strength\" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.In any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. \"\" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",

Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.So like, the way you would check if “racecar” is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter. And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say “letter”… I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.If EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome). If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn’t a palindrome.You could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen. So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you’re working with. And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you’re checking the first half against the back half. So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything. But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).Etc. But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part. Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely. Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part. And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part). And then you have to deal with making sure you’ve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",

All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.Therefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.Using your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.OK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same \"distance\" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.You may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like \"if it's odd, do this. If even, do that\". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm \"just works\" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.A solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (\"write the code\"), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter. How do you solve problems? By transforming data, one step at a time.",

Pick the language of your choice3. Finish all exercises. At least try to make 75% progress. By the time you hit that, you should have built some mild muscle memory as well as some creativity and rigor.

Pick an interesting stuff to build (e.g. Emulator > C > \"Writing a game boy emulator\")3. Follow and complete the introductory tutorial and try to expand with more featuresThe paid way:1. Create an account on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)2. Pick a challenge (e.g. \"Build an interpreter from scratch\")3. Pick a language (e.g. C)4. Follow the instructionsIt's 30$ per month though, so you gotta be committed asf and make the most of it: don't just blindly complete the challenges or worse: slack off. Read docs, engage in the community, get your project reviewed by someone, make sure you thoroughly understand the tool you just built (beyond the source code that you write).Third step: personal projectsSurely there are plenty of things you want to do... If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.After all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love. Maybe during your learning journey, you spotted a nice game engine project and you want to participate in its development. The entire world is yours to discover at this point!",

To me, your post reads as if you had been in hibernation for several semesters, yet, somehow managed to pass your grades (which I can't figure out at best will). Also, how can anyone spend weeks getting a git repository to work? There are so many top quality tutorials on git/github that at utmost searching for 20 minutes and doing 2 hours of tutorials should enable you to do what is needed to get your repository and branch it. This is really basic stuff.If your level is, as you say, so far behind, you cannot catch up in a matter of mere months.Honestly, I am baffled beyond all reason how you managed to miss just about everything and still get to the place where you are.",

You need, in my opinion:to speak to select people about this with an actionable focus.There needs to be a real conversationwith your academic leaders- this teacher you speak of, PIs, practitioners, other teachers, whoever. The token douchebag classmate is not a credible outlet. Yeah, it’s scary as dog shit, and these professionals can sometimes respond to queries harshly, but it will A) show initiative and curry you favor if you *do end up in a tight spot because of a technical lacking*, and B) help you tighten up and figure out how you are going to survive and compete. And you gotta trust me on this one. Whatever you do, find a leader you trust to talk to.Then you can add in some sort of counseling or vent-based release protocol for handling the *feeling of not feeling worthy or competent* because that is a whole different introspective beast.If and when you do have this talk, compartmentalize. Minimize the “I feel” statements. Focus on objective problems that you are having.I’m sure you’re aware of most of this, but take it from someone who has struggled immensely at multiple levels and has had substantial technical and research success in spite of that.Talk to your people. And when you’re done, make changes, and talk again.Cheers",

Most people that make it as programmers are passionate and curious; they have a specific goal in mind, whether it be software engineering, machine learning or game development. that curiosity leads them to explore those areas outside of the curriculum and allows them to become familiar with industry standard tools. It sounds like the course you're doing focuses on giving you solid fundamentals(although it is a bit weird that git/version control isn't a part of that), and you're supposed to build upon those fundamentals yourself. Realistically, just following a course and not doing any extra curricular learning yourself isn't good enough nowadays, if you want to get hired.The good news is that you can change this. Ask yourself why you do programming? Is there a particular field you're drawn to? A passion you want to cultivate? Then prove it to yourself by actually studying and creating projects in that area in your spare time.If you're not sure what you're passionate about, then at least try something and see what sticks.As a personal example I never thought I would be interested in learning the really low level stuff until I came across a certain resource and then I just fell down a rabbit hole and allowed it to consume me.Good luck",

        "body": "Current CS major here who is still learning and finding cool resources outside of school:Looks like your programming skills are not a problem just a lack of familiarity with common tools. That is okay but you just need to play catch up. I suggest watching videos or following tutorials and actually practice using these tools like Git, Git Hub, Docker, etc as you mentioned but with a guide so you do not get lost. These seem hard but once you use them for a bit it gets easier. Even I struggle to understand new topics and tools but you got to push through and enjoy the grind.Resources:1. After reading your post I feel this is the best resource as per the gaps in knowledge you state you want to fill. It looks like you want to get familiar with command line interfaces(CLI), Git and Git Hub(which are different things), and how node.js and Java Script programs work. I **highly recommend** [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) course(free/asynchronous) to get familiar with all these tools(Git, Git Hub, Java Script, node.js, HTML, CSS, not docker though). It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings. 1. I was also confused about Git and Git Hub less than a year ago but using The Odin Project made me understand it a lot better and why it is so useful. BTW heres an extra resource to practice Git commands after you get familiar with using it: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en\\_US](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)2. You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills. It is also free and asynchronous but it has less focus on tools and more on thinking and problem solving which will only help you. They are lecture style with additional shorter videos and problem sets to solve.3. I see you also are a bit interested in game dev, if so follow tutorials for games on the Godot engine or even Unity or Game Maker. Anything really and do not feel bad about doing so especially if you have never used it. Of course do not just copy and paste from the video and try to take make it your own. Brackey's could be a good start but there are other great You Tube videos for game dev.I am not an expert but I would say you do not have to know everything but you have to get familiar with general tools. Of course when you get put into a project or land a job you may have to learn a new tool but if you get a sense of the generally popular tools needed for a specific project that will help you adapt.All in all do no give up just keep going, acknowledge your lack of experience but build upon what you know and do not know.",

For prestigious companies, it's the same, only more competitive so you need to practice to give better answers than your competitors.

Think about what you can do to move you closer to the solution. Doing this for complex problems requires experience, so start with simple problems that you can solve with your experience. Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.This is what you do every morning when you plan out your day. If you have a meeting at 10:00, and it takes you 20 minutes to get there, you need to leave at 9:40. But if you have to stop by the post office on the way, and it will take 5 minutes you need to include that in your time. But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.So, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don’t go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.Have other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.It may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.It is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.Decompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there. Start at the top and keep breaking things down until you can solve the immediate problem, then work back up to the big problem.",

Books can only take you so far; they often shape the way you *think*, but it’s doing that shapes what you *know*.Set yourself an objective, build a program, and learn what you need along the way. That’s the essence of programming: breaking a big idea into smaller ideas, then breaking those into even smaller pieces until you’re left with the simplest possible tasks. Just like many small rivers form an ocean, many small solutions build the whole system.For me, programming has become a true passion. Logic isn’t something you’re born with—it’s something you develop over time through practice. After 30 years, I can hold hundreds of thousands of lines of code in my head. Sometimes I even dream about programming—and often, I wake up having solved problems I couldn’t crack the day before.The key is simple: practice. There’s no other way.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.At the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.I examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing, select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base. Everything was coded in Fortran, however I was coding in other platforms and languages as needed.",

If you have ADHD, I suggest you ignore this rabbit hole for now as others have said.

While I love Arch and have used it for likely longer than many have been alive at this point, there really isn't a specific need for it or Nix OS for many companies at the moment. We like to create complexity out of boredom often in this field. I suggest just using Ubuntu for a little while until you become familiar with the basics of using it.Will you learn more with Arch? Absolutely. But you may also stall out quickly and the frustration may lead you into feeling inadequate (which is a feeling you should get used to if you want to do this professionally).

Once you're good at coding (which takes years), you'll be able to learn a new framework quickly.So stop worrying about picking the wrong one. In fact, all of the time you're worrying is time you're not building the skill, which is the only important part.I don't think there's ever a single thing I've regretted learning. I wouldn't worry that you're wasting time by learning the wrong thing. There is no wrong thing if you're learning and writing code.Here's the only recipe you need: (1) think of something you want to build, then (2) figure out everything you'd need to learn to build that, and then (3) learn those things. Then keep doing that until the things you're building are the kinds of things employers want.Much, much later, when your skills are good and you can build things successfully, you can start looking for what specific things employers are asking for and filling in gaps.

Just my take on it, you will get a lot of little wins faster with go than you will with rust. And a lot of the knowledge you learn is directly transferrable. Best of luck, cheers.",

Hello World CalculatorWhat you'll build: A command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.Rust concepts introduced:Variables and mutability (let vs let mut)Basic data types (integers, floats)Functions and return valuesPattern matching with matchError handling basics with ResultUser input with std::io2. Number Guessing GameWhat you'll build: A game where the computer picks a random number and the user guesses it.Rust concepts introduced:External crates (rand crate)Loops (loop, while, for)Comparison operatorsString parsing with .parse()The Ordering enumCargo package management3. Temperature ConverterWhat you'll build: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperatures.Rust concepts introduced:Structs and methodsimpl blocksAssociated functions vs methodsFloating-point arithmeticCommand-line argument parsingModule organization4. Word CounterWhat you'll build: Analyze text files to count words, lines, and characters.Rust concepts introduced:File I/O with std::fsString manipulation and slicingCollections: HashMap and VecIterators and iterator adaptersThe ? operator for error propagationLifetime basics with string slices5. Todo List ManagerWhat you'll build: A command-line todo application that saves tasks to a file.Rust concepts introduced:Enums with data (enum TaskStatus)Serialization with serde and JSONVector operations (push, remove, iterate)Pattern matching on enumsFile persistenceError handling with custom error types6. Basic HTTP ClientWhat you'll build: A simple program that makes HTTP requests and processes responses.Rust concepts introduced:External HTTP crate (reqwest)Async programming basics (async/await)JSON parsingResult chainingOption handlingNetwork error handling7. Log File ParserWhat you'll build: Parse web server logs and generate statistics.Rust concepts introduced:Regular expressions (regex crate)Advanced iterator patternsTrait implementationGeneric functionsAdvanced HashMap usageDate/time handling with chrono8. Concurrent File ProcessorWhat you'll build: Process multiple files simultaneously using threads.Rust concepts introduced:Ownership and borrowing in depthThread spawning with std::threadChannel communication (mpsc)Shared state with Arc and MutexThread safety conceptsLifetime annotations9. Simple Web ServerWhat you'll build: A basic HTTP server that serves static files.Rust concepts introduced:TCP sockets and networkingTrait objects and dynamic dispatchAdvanced error handling patternsBox smart pointersPattern matching on complex typesHTTP protocol basics10. Mini Database/Key-Value StoreWhat you'll build: A simple persistent key-value database with basic CRUD operations.Rust concepts introduced:Advanced ownership patternsReference counting with Rc and RefCellBinary serializationFile locking and concurrent accessGeneric programming with traitsAdvanced lifetime managementPerformance optimization conceptsEach project builds upon the previous ones, gradually introducing more complex Rust concepts. Start with the calculator and work your way up—by the time you complete all 10, you'll have a solid foundation in Rust programming and understand most of the language's key features.The progression moves from basic syntax and control flow to advanced topics like concurrency, async programming, and memory management that make Rust unique among systems programming languages.",

You have to read the original code, type in that code and then re-read what you have typed. You also have to be accurate enough to make sure the code actually works, and if it doesn't once again you have to engage your mind to figure out what has gone wrong. That whole process requires you to think about the code. By comparison, copying and pasting takes absolutely no effort and you certainly don't get the same insight as to what code just got added to the file.",

Always solve the problem on paper first.This is slow and tedious and all sorts of difficult at first. Which is why it works.Later on, you can relax this restriction. But if you're able to solve a problem on paper, then you'll learn problem-solving. Programming consists of problem-solving (this step) and encoding the solution in code (the next one), among other things.Copying code does not teach you [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving). It doesn't even teach you the encoding step, though it may help to refresh your memory. Therefore you will not be able to learn how to solve problems, which is at the heart of programming. You likely won't improve much because you haven't practiced the relevant skills.",

How are you supposed to know how to interact with the DOM in the way you want to without looking at the proper documentation? You don’t just know that stuff magically. If you want to learn web development your best friend is going to be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ I personally would stay away from the bloated frameworks like React. Learn to do web development through vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. Once you start getting to the point that you think to yourself, “surely there is a better way to do this”, you can start looking into things like Sass, HTML templating, etc. Personally, my stack is JS (Fastify), Squirrelly, Scss, MongoDB, and Redis running on linode servers. If you want to learn web development I recommend going down this route. Start to add things on a need to have basis and don’t blindly follow things because it’s the latest trend. Get the fundamentals down first and then explore. It’s a process to learn these things and I am sure you are in no rush to push out a “product”. Best of luck and don’t give up. Just because it doesn’t click immediately doesn’t mean it isn’t possible. Learning to program is a long process and as someone who’s been working in industry for 4 years now with a non-CS degree, this is the path that helped me become a solid developer.",

Speaking from personal experience, I think it’s easy to over prepare. To keep knocking out frameworks, courses, whatever, without ever getting the confidence to dive in and start building. You probably have the requisite knowledge, training, and ability to go off-piste and stop just checking boxes to check them. I’m not saying don’t learn React or whatever thoroughly if it is applicable, but I am saying you are at the point where you may have more success if you start deciding for yourself what is applicable and what isn’t.

Real C# devs often work on Visual studio 2022/Jet brains rider and only work on vscode becasue it's lightweight, but harder to setup proper project with vscode from scratch.",

For instance we could talk about electrons moving between different atoms, or we could ignore the atoms, and abstract even higher and talk about electricity flowing.In a computer we have the software that controls the hardware, decides how the electricity flows, but it is impossible to grasp all the details - most computers have billions of transistors that can turn on and off, so we ignore the details and talk about the CPU storing numbers in memory, and performing mathematical operations on those numbers. Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the \"world just as it is\" with it's particles and whatnot.In programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on. And so on and so forth. Higher means easier to talk about, because we ignore or hide the details.",

That's how the supersonic jets are defined (they can fly faster than the speed of sound).If you're asking \"what does a higher level of abstraction mean\" which is a different question, then it's helpful to know what a low level of abstraction is.Most consider assembly language a low-level of abstraction. It involves registers (fast pieces of memory living on the CPU), memory, ways to move the data from memory to registers, and to use two registers to do some math or comparison operation (or other operations). You're limited to the actual resources. But you can hide that from the user so they think they have an unlimited number of variables. Behind the scenes, the implementation moves the data between registers and memory giving you the illusion of unlimited variables.Higher levels of abstraction let you think far away from the actual implementation, usually in a mathematical sort of way, and hide the grungy details. This allows you to program the way you want to, and get more done, faster.",

But you guys have no formal school system so you only know how to count but no writing and no ***higher math***. So one day you discovered that it seems like each T-Rex has about 32 teeth. He realized this because you have been keeping them in holes near the camp ground with each hole teeth from one T-Rex. And since you do not write and do not add, every time you go out to trade with other tribes you simply dig up one whole put everything in your dino purse and go. You know it is enough but not how many. But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth. So a hole is 32 teeth and you reasoned a dino purse from a hole is 32 teeth, so you decided to count purses in the future and stop worrying about the teeth and the holes. That is abstraction: teeth -> purses.",

I've been programming as a full stack web developer for over half a decade now, and I'd still call myself \"intermediate at TypeScript\". Recently I've been play with a lot of local, open source AI models, even though I never technically learned Python (and even though I suck at math).My point being: It doesn't matter where you are in your programming journey, you cannot look at it like \"OMG, there's so many things to learn\". There is ALWAYS more to learn. If you spent 100 years learning one thing, you'd die before you learned \"everything about it\". So you need to just accept where you are, and push in a direction that interests you. Maybe you end up being the programmer that \"only designs buttons\" or maybe you become the programmer that \"builds entire operating systems by themself\".

Data related roles often have less competition than front end developer jobs, and they line up well with what you’ve done before. On the loop you described.. I need to do this > I don’t know > read docs > feel lost. That’s actually part of the process. The key is breaking projects into smaller steps. Instead of saying I need to build an app, say I’ll just connect to a database or I’ll write one small query. Finishing those small steps builds confidence, and over time, you’ll realize you’re moving forward more than you think.33 is not old at all in tech. When you go for internships, focus less on being perfect technically, and more on how you’ve dealt with problems, figured things out, and helped people in your past roles. That’s what managers like to see in interns. Internships are designed for people who are still learning. Companies don’t expect you to come in as an expert.So I'd say apply anyway even if you feel underqualified. Build small projects that show your database skills. Keep practicing, but don’t get stuck waiting until you feel ready because you’ll never feel 100% ready. The confidence comes once you’re in the role and learning by doing.

For an experienced programmer, it's fine though. I would say AI is more of a sidekick while \"automate the boring stuff\" or other more structured courses are the main resource.",

That's the only sort of extension / tool that I can think of but those won't necessarily point out things like tight coupling. I think some of them point out large numbers of imports, but for things like sonar, they just have limits on them like \"no more than x imports\". I don't know of a tool that will actively fix them for you though. Some of these scanners have code duplication detection as well, that might be a good indicator of where you can combine things or reorganize.EDIT: after some quick googling, Ndepend and DGML apparently are good tools for scanning.\\>Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thingNot sure I know what you mean here without an example. My initial thought is you could have some base class which does all the common stuff and implement it differently with the variations. Alternately, you could combine the functionality into one class and add an element to said class that chooses whether to do one variation of logic or another based on what that element is.",

Having the path and following it are two completely different things.Also, being around computers is something most people do now. Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming. To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.What's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.So, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?I'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)You could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).Then, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).CS50w covers some backend stuff.You could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.Of course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build. But that's kind of a big \"if\" (to find a project you'll be interested in that isn't impossibly difficult).Anyway, good luck. You'll have to sift through a lot of advice and decide what to do.",

Freelancing and entrepreneurial efforts are, I believe, the best route for new developers in 2025. It's a slightly different path than the old Node and React route. Those are good tools, but they're better for teams than solo developers. I recommend using The Odin Project, especially if your interest is primarily in back end development. Try their Ruby on Rails path. Rails has been in decline for several years, but it's still a viable platform for solo development, and, more importantly, it will teach you how the back end works. Routing, models, controllers, services, ORMs,.etc. That should serve as a solid foundation for you going forward. Python and Django, for example, will make a lot more sense if you have a Rails background. So will many opinionated frameworks. But you're going to hear a lot of opinions based on your question.

In my honest and humble opinion,  Android (and jetpack compose in particular), is more pleasant and less nerve wreaking than iOs.Cross platform: welcome to the jungle! Cross or multi platform developer is gaining in popularity,  mainly because management can save a buck. There's so many frameworks available out there, it's difficult to decide,  but here's my 2 cents:- no-no: Qt framework, Xamarin, Ionic, React Native. Developer experience and overall quality is plain bad.- maybe: Kotlin Multi Platform. It's in its early stages,  and rough around the edges, but I see huge potential. - best option: Flutter. For so many reasons, let me know if you want to know more.At the end of the day, they all work in the same way: your code transpiles to cpp and h, and these are compiled vis cmake. Hence,  you may as well create your own. Worth mentioning: mobile development is not just \"the app\", but the release train as well:- github workflows- fastlane- google play, apple dev portal and store connect- certificates and permissions (see in app purchases, keypass auth, etc etc)Let me know if I can help you further. Edit: I forgot to mention something very important,  that will help you succeed as an engineer,  and not just a developer: architecture. Learn as much as possible about that. Most principles con be transferred to backend development,  and even lower level programming. Read other people's code. When you do it for work it's draining, but when it's not is like learning from the masters. I recently dissected Arduino CLI, for instance,  and I discovered a gem of clarity an structure. The world is full of open source code, just clone it and start reading",

I actually hated it hahaha. But Kotlin and Native apps were more popular than cross-platforms libraries back then.Now 2025, I'm a L4 mobile app developer with React Native as a lot of companies moved from native code to React Native apps.From my above experience, starting with SPA and Apache Cordoba (or any other hybrid app solution) is a great start to how mobile apps are compiled.From there I would suggest React Native.Learning Kotlin or Swift is a plus, but not mandatory.Also, perhaps a bit of Flutter would be a great too!",

If there's 100 lessons, and I do 1 then obviously 2 is next.If I do 90 next to see what it's like then should you suggest 2 or 91 next? That's not as clear cut.Just store for each lesson the time it was completed at, and then for the \"next\" lesson you can just get the most recently completed with a single query and suggest the next one as long as it's still within the limits of how many there are. If the queries are taking a while, you can consider denormalizing and having a table that is literally just the most recent completion (or the next lession to suggest) so that you can fetch it more quickly.You may also want to consider event sourcing, it's probably more complex to learn/setup the first time, but you can then retroactively apply different display logic after the fact since the events are all available to reconstruct how the currrent state was reached. HOWEVER, if it's your first app I would just go the standard CRUD way first and maybe consider trying to do event sourcing after to compare/contrast the strengths and weaknesses yourself.",

She also has courses on full-stack web dev, iOS app dev, and various others. It's a good way to get out of the funk it sounds like you're in.Otherwise, I'd say give yourself a break, friend. You already have more knowledge than you realize; you just need to dive back in and *keep up the momentum*. A video course like the ones above are good for keeping up that momentum, and you'll end up with some projects that show your skills. Plus they're easy to build into bigger, more impressive projects.And you don't need to be terrified. You've had a bad experience, now it's time to move on.Best of luck, and enjoy the ride!",

        "body": "Most of the other answers in this thread are wrong.Some people are saying that the addresses are different because forking creates a new address space. That doesn't explain the output because the new address space has new *physical* memory mappings for the same *virtual* address space, and the address you're printing is a virtual address. Userspace programs can't (easily) see physical addresses at all; they only see virtual addresses.Some people are saying this is due to address space randomization. That's wrong because ASLR doesn't change any of the virtual addresses in a forked process. (Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.The answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.Your code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the \"if\" branch, and `c` and `d` in the \"else\" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.More precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.If you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1dBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",

Therefore the contents in parent and child processes are totally different, as in they are in different physical regions in memory (in reality is a little bit more complex, since usually the Copy-On-Write mechanism will be used). Nevertheless, even if you were using InterProcess (IPC) shared memory, where the underlying physical memory would be the same for both processes, they would still have different virtual addresses, since in general mmap won't map to the same virtual addresses the underlying physical memory region on both processes (unless explicitly requested to mmap to the same specific virtual addresses on both processes).",

Example: we have two arrays array[x,y] and array[index,number] the [index,number] array is what we use to determine where our number is located based on the index we assign in that one. So it's two arrays of tuples basically. Now we just take the two numbers we want to get the time to traverse between from the [index,number] array, use the index from that tuple we defined to then get its coordinate by getting the element in the [x,y] located at said index and subtract the x1 from x2 and etc like i stated before and then divide by 2 and round up.I think this scales for any size that's the same size for the column and rows but idk",

You **can** do machine learning in any language, **but** Python is a really common interface language, **but** the actual computation behind the scenes is normally written in something like C.The real answer is: Python is a good choice of language for beginners and it has a lot of machine learning support. After that, if your future employer wants you to use something else or your future projects require you to use something else, then be open to it. Most programming languages have similarish fundamentals anyway, so it's not time wasted - it's just adding tools to your toolkit, and once you've learnt how to use one, others will come more easily.

You are a beginner so its good to get experience with different tools or programing languages(obviously in the future you can specialize). Its good you have these interests and you should stick with them since that makes learning fun.1. Seeing as you like Python and want a good structured course, I would say start [CS50p on EDx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).2. Harvard has other course under \"CS50\" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said \"like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding\" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn. As many people have said you learn by doing aka projects even if they are small or simple. The important part is you thought about what to type out and learned something during the process.",

        "body": "# CS50p:Yes good hands on problems to solve, though they are not projects this course still offers a good foundation to expand and cement your Python skills(epically since you are interested in machine learning). To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:1. functions,2. variables,3. conditionals,4. loops,5. exceptions cases,6. using libraries,7. unit tests file I/O,8. regular expression,9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,10. recursion.This is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.# The Odin Project:This has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.The structure is:* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources* Make a project which is a website such as: * Basic HTML page * Landing page with styling * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.This is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.If you have more questions feel free to ask!",

Keep your school stuff in private repos that only you, collaborators assigned by your professors, and maybe your professors, have access to. Using git and GitHub in school will definitely give you a leg up in professional settings (I met seniors who still had no idea how to do basic git stuff). Tho... I'm pretty certain GitHub is using private repos to train Copilot and other LLMs... So who even knows anymore.

Your variables give you the location of the \\*start\\* of the data structure, but you have to be aware of how big they are, or where the \\*end\\* of the data structures are.This is particularly important when dealing with arrays. The line: char buffer[MAXSIZE];is telling the compiler, \"reserve a chunk of memory as big as sizeof(char) \\* MAXSIZE in the stack frame of this function\". There is NO PROTECTION to make sure you stay inside your MAXSIZE-sized buffer; if you ask the compiler to do this: buffer[MAXSIZE + 5] = 'x';it will happily do that. which will, of course, go stomping on some other variable in your function's stack, or off into unallocated memory, or who knows what. You are responsible for always being aware of where the end of your fixed size buffers are, and always checking your offsets (or pointers, if you go that way) to make sure you are still in bounds. This is, of course, a pain, and much of the discipline of working with C is about finding easy to manage and easy to maintain ways of dealing with such data structures.I compiled your program and fed it a 5000-byte input, and it segfaulted immediately.

        "body": "I take the opposite opinion. TBH I think many big tech companies were over hiring engineers for years. Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. I was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. I'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. Anyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. Twitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. Google/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products. Anyways it's all first hand thoughts and super anecdotal. I just don't see why people would go back to hiring as much as they did with the salaries as they were. It was kind of silly and frankly most people I know in FAANG were coasting pretty hard.",

But don't worry, there's automation for that.All you need to do is annotate the data when you capture it, when you store it, and then set up monitoring to ensure that the data doesn't move outside of the environment it's in.

Cloud is where things are a bit harder go learn but theres free tiers, just gotta make sure you dont do silly things and end up blowing past the free tier limits. In AWS land I would try to build some demo apps leveraging some of the core AWS services like S3, SQS, EC2.I wouldnt expect a newgrad to be an expert in any of these but any experience would surely be valuable.I highly recommend reading docs on the design and architecture of these systems, that is to me more valuable than learning some APIs. If you understand how Kafka works and when to use it, why it gives you the guarantees that it gives you and so on, that will make you a valuable member of the team from day one.Good luck!",

Doing that successfully will already bring you close to the actually knowledgeable people in the team and management will start to notice that you actually understand/are engaging to understand the business instead of just technical parts of it. This is how you build your reputation and are considered a valuable resource.Then shift into first phase of your real agenda of automation on a drip. Don't make a big splash. Get the minimum creds to do the minimum automation. Make sure to make your boss look good in the process - ALWAYS. Ensure that you are the key person in the automated workflow. Now you are important enough that you are being included in the mid level or even senior level meetings. Stay the course for another year and keep showing results. By now you also have idea of the political camps and power structure. Be balanced politically but start to identify potential allies and adversaries.Now that you have managements ear, switch into the final phase. Get the big players on your side. Show them how much they get to gain by supporting your vision. Because you are ready to fill the big shoes. This is the most political phase and most dangerous. But if you have the main players supporting you, you should be able to wrestle the rest of the keys. By now you have all the knowledge so gate keeping is not possible. You have built a cred and since you made your boss look good, he suddenly can't start to shit on you. The people who he will go to are on your side already because they see their own gain. From here on, it is a balance of pure execution and marketing. This is the endgame, don't screw it up.Or, forget about all this and find another job you like.",

At the time of my last interview, I was writing typescript and react code daily for a side project, so I was entirely in my element.So if it's C# that's popular, practice and level up your proficiency with C# and .NET, if it's Java, then get good with Java and Spring or whatever. Also, think of difficult problems you've solved or ran into in the past. Document how you solved them, and have a good answer for this kind of question. It comes up in pretty much every interview I've had and always opens up a conversation going into more detail, and I feel like thats the best position to be in during an interview; a discussion where you get to take the lead and control the conversation.",

But it is a legit point that anybody in his position should be considering. He himself said he changes jobs every couple of years and doesn't have \"expert level\" (which might just be mid that he thinks is \"expert\") in any one language. The odds seem high he's fallen into the classic trap of 6x 1YOE rather than having 6YOE? If so, then no wonder he's struggling badly in mid level interviews in this current job market. Thus this is an aspect he needs to urgently address, but we can't even get to the point of discussing how to do this, if he won't even discuss it as a possibility.Edit 2, to reply to u/Azureflames20:> I feel like if you’re someone who takes this much offense to a valid possible criticism, there’s some bigger ego issues to work on and squish.Yeah I'd bet money on the fact he doesn't just have technical skills he needs to work on, but is lacking in soft skills areas as well, that are likely coming through during the interviews.Edit 3, a reply to u/mariogario123:> So why is someone who stuck around for 6 years going to be knowing more than someone who jumped every, let’s say, 1.5 years. Am certainly not saying 6yrs is the optimal time to stay at a company! (from the employee perspective... )But if you're jumping every year or two, then do you truly get to see the full entire SDLC? And thus truly feel the ramifications of the decisions that are made way back at the start. Or are you jumping too early every time to learn the lessons? Don't think we can say there is one magic \"optimal number\", depends so much on: the person, the company, market conditions, and more.Edit 4, a reply to u/evanescent-despair:> So what should someone who’s jobless even do if they have a 6x 1YOE situation?Well, first of all they need to recognize it, as then it is easier to come up with a plan to fix it. They might even find this realization freeing. As if you're 6YOE deep into a career, you might feel yourself \"stuck\" in it with \"golden handcuffs\" (or at least silver plated handcuffs). And you can't just give this up and take a big drop / step back into a new career instead. However, if you're just at 1YOE into it reality, then it's much easier to decide upon a career pivot?While if they *do* decide to stick with it, they need to figure out their strengths and weaknesses, so they can play to their strengths and patch up their weaknesses to at least competent mid level. Because they need to quickly be able to \"fake\" being mid/senior level and even better in the long run *actually become* mid/senior level ability. As likely they're coming across in interviews and their CV as someone who is *not* mid/senior and interviewers are smelling this from a mile away. And nobody wants a 6YOE Junior!",

I suggest just look for one single ticket you can close. Probably there is something like \"verify the results of regression testing.\" Then in your stand up you say you ran the regression tests and logged the results and verified the fix was successful. In SCRUM meetings you're just supposed to say you did so-and-so or a single task and today you will be doing another task - so you state what that task will be. Probably if I was the manager I might wonder what are you going to be doing today? You kind of need someone in the team you are on to be a mentor to you so reach out to some of the other team members and try to become friends with them.

        "body": "> It's also pretty easy to create a practical coding test in gitpod, and then do point-based scoring. But most managers never thought of that, nor attempted to do so. They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.I'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.I have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.---As for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.Yes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

        "body": "Hard disagree as someone who is currently an IC, has been a manager, and in both roles have conducted quite a few interviews. I conducted over a dozen last month.For the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).When I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just * How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).Don't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

I was nearly down-leveled over a Karot interview which happened in the first week of studying LC in a new language, Java. With a slow interview process, I was able to get up to speed on all the other parts, and by the time I got to a a hiring manager I felt pretty good. Now I'm a team lead at that job, lol.The biggest difference, is that to be successful today, versus in 2020, is that companies are being a bit more picky. Whether that's judging pedigree/experience with more scrutiny, or making the interview process longer and involving more steps with higher bars.Either way, making a step up is very much possible, but you'll likely have to learn the interview process and invest time into the various skills: pitching yourself, LC (or whatever knowledge base is required for ML), systems design (esp. LLM serving, ML systems), and finally behavioral.Personally, I'll jump in about 18 months if I don't make Staff and can't switch orgs, and I'm planning about a 6 month period of interview prep, some LC, lots of sys design, and really focus on behavioral. I'm definitely a corporate-type, neoliberal and process-based thinker, and if you can lean into that it really helps.",

They assumed that because I was familiar with Java, I would could become familiar with C# pretty quickly, and they were right. I was up to speed with C# in less than a day. Now, the job market is a lot more competitive now than it was back then, but that really just means that you should take the half a day on your own to become familiar with Java so you can have that on your resume before you apply.",

I've written production code in several languages, mostly Haskell, with a little Python, Rails, and Typescript, and I find SpringBoot really efficient. It's the type of framework where good practices are a pit that you basically fall into by doing things the conventional way. Lots of people rail on Java, espeically the Haskell programmers and the Rust community, but a language like Haskell is a major pain to set up, since there's a million ways to do things, and even though there are plenty of libraries, each has like 5-10 stars on github. Even with Rust, it's not worth it to spend your time on such complexity, when the benefit of better speed or type safety can be mitigated in other ways.",

Do you have friends in developer roles at your company, or even better, engineering managers? You gotta start making some if not. Pick up any projects you can that will get you working more closely with dev teams. Once you have a decent contact or 2 in engineering, just grab lunch with those persons and have a frank conversation with them that you’re looking to transition to development and ask what you would need to be able to demonstrate to get moved into a junior role.Having a level of rapport and trust with individuals making hiring decisions is 1000x more important for landing a role than a degree of experience.

That's it.But at the same time, a lot of companies do have tuition reimbursement programs. Places like Target, Walmart, etc offer full tuition reimbursement to their employees. The idea being an \"unskilled\" minimum wage employee that gets their education paid for will stay at the company, but move into corporate/leadership roles that require an education.So what you're describing already happens. But, an important part of that whole concept is you need to be an employee *before* you get tuition reimbursement. No company is just gonna pay for a random person's college. But a lot of them will pay for someone's college that is already a trusted employee, with the hopes that it builds a level of trust/loyalty and grows their employees internally.The whole idea of graduating high school, and immediately going to college, and immediately starting your career in a job that requires a degree is just one way to enter the industry. If you choose that path, you're paying for your college. That's your choice. But if you choose an alternative path, where you put in your time at a place like Target, you can have your college paid for. For whatever reason a lot of people don't like that path though.",

As such I don't think it's good to have a hackathon as your first project unless it has some prestige or is well known.If the front end dev experience is just your club, I wouldn't put it under experience unless you were actually paid or officially tasked by your university for it even then might not be recommended, since you already have an internship.",

To me it's dumbassery and not some vague idea of a market.The thing with playing leadership Russian roulette is that it creates chaos, and company culture ends up in flux, and you simply don't know what company you're really joining. The company may not resemble the one you heard about in interviews simply because they cleaned out the leadership either during your application process or early in your job there. It's frustrating and it can practically nullify your \"reverse interview\" efforts.I would say this is a red flag for the company and you should think long and hard about working there.

Of course, it depends on a lot of things... benefits, work environment, and so on.\"Don't tell them you'll go *lower* for those things, just that it *depends* on these things.So let's say I'd love 120, I'll be happy with 100, and I might settle for 90.

This lead to a few outages and upper management (CIO included) wanting to kill my project, forcing me to justify *every single update* we make. On top of that, I'm fighting internal politics, favoritism, poor communication and coordination.

If you're not content with something, it gives everyone else an excuse to not be happy with it. Learn to be proud of your achievements.If this doesn't vibe with you, my biggest advice is just leave big tech. There are many types of organizations that are much suited for your personality and you just need to find the right fit. If you can't find something that fits you, then you'd have to change yourself to fit it. The latter has always been a challenge in my 20 year career as well.",

We had one junior (there were six of us) that had this \"don't worry it's just java web development, it's easy.\" Some of us were struggling hard and hearing this actually made one of the devs switch to a QA position.

That said, there's things you can do that will help.Break your team's responsibilities down into pillars or silos of knowledge (your manager can help with what your team specifically works on). Usually, it's these:* Infrastructure/Networking* Application Orchestration* Observability* Internal ToolsTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.When you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.Total honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.All that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

Worst case usually is they will just forget about you, and sometimes they'll even wish you well and be friendly the next time you cross paths.

That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.A company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.That, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. \"Do you have a good WLB?\" --> \"Yep!\". Easy peezy.Instead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.For example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no \"right\" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.If an interviewer said something like \"The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds\" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.Another example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.Again, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***. Not a month. I politely rejected that company.Think about what makes up a good WLB *to you*. Then develop questions asking about those things.",

C#, like Java, has many jobs available for it.

Not every company has a microservice architecture where you can choose to simply write a new feature in Go.On the other hand a lot of what would formerly be written in Java if the project is greenfield Go is becoming very popular. I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go. The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it. So its become more attractive in that sphere. If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.So basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on. Luckily Go is a fairly tiny language (which honestly gets people in trouble because they become expert beginners in it very quickly) so its pretty quick to learn. You just need to learn some of the idioms of the language. Though I typically don't really hammer people on the language during interviews anyways. I can pretty quickly get a Java dev up to speed on how to write proper Go.",

They agreed, and I became a Consulting Engineer. Technically the same pay level as a manager, but seen as a technical leader of sorts and without the HR responsibility. The downside is the opportunity to earn fat bonuses was also substantially reduced, but overall great move for my personal sanity.The biggest lesson I learned??

I basically spend most of my day looking for job apps to apply to. expect to be ghosted, and many, many rejections. new grad market is incredibly competitive right now, so unless you leverage people you meet at internships, expect for it to be an uphill battle.You live in seattle so you'll have better access to companies (and some prefer candidates that are local), so I'd start there. Get involved in your prior college and current CC's events, job fairs, hackathons, anything. Networking is going to be the only saving grace in my opinion.And look into government or defense roles. Having a security clearance would definitely give you a leg up, and many companies that have roles (microsoft, for one) that exclusively handle govt data require one",

The reason being that your current employer might resent you for forcing their hand and look for a way to get rid of you later. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, and have taken the counter-offer in the past without negative repercussions. I did leave that employer 6 months after taking the counter-offer when I got an even better offer, so it didn't really work out for them, but it was good for me.* Your compensation is on the low end for the senior SWE in a super expensive city, especially given the RTO requirement. The fact that you secured another offer, and your current employer wants to keep you, means you could likely do better.* Outside of compensation, there might be other benefits to working at the current company. E.g. You might get good leadership experience in the new lead role. Think about whether it might be possible to move within your current company to work under a different manager.* If you aren't able to switch teams while staying at your current employer, I'd probably recommend taking the other offer, based solely on the fact that you described the current team as \"quite toxic\". Hopefully the new role will be pretty chill, and you'll have time to upskill on your own, then seek out an even better offer.",

However, if you’re working alongside other Seniors and they’re not doing the level of team management you’re doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn’t have Leads, that’s a very different situation.There are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there’s what’s called a “Tech Lead Manager”, which is sort of in between the two – usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don’t do salary review, etc.One useful way to frame this is, “I’m enjoying the work I’m doing to lead (or ‘help lead’) the team, and I’d like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I’m doing the highest impact things?”Basically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine… and is often not fine for reasons that you don’t have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there’s something fundamental that you’re missing, you’re better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you’re not being promoted.Depending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",

The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of \"wasted\" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \\_only\\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. Coding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, \"beyond human\" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, \"code\" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. Basically it would look a lot like how ML \"brains\" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect. A beyond human program would work the same way, a black box that we just test until it does what we want it to do.",

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And \"stability\" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.Unit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.\"better than human\" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.One example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a \"better than human\" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.Better than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. \"Difficult to extend\" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch. It doesn't *need* an elegant solution that doesn't need to be re-written with every little change.Your chess analogy isn't really that great here. All the elements of chess are inherent to the existence of chess. An AI is just learning to play the game. But a significant amount of the elements that make up *human* programming are not inherent to *programming*.",

Technical writing, product management, business analysis, project management, and sales engineering all leverage your tech background while moving away from pure development work.Data analysis roles in non-tech industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics often need people who understand both technology and domain-specific problems. Your programming background makes you valuable for automating processes or building internal tools.Teaching or training - bootcamps, corporate training programs, or educational content creation - let you use your technical knowledge to help others learn. Many former developers transition into developer relations, technical recruiting, or consulting roles.The current tech job market difficulties don't necessarily mean the entire industry is collapsing. Many experienced developers are finding opportunities, just with longer search times and more competition than previous years.Before pivoting completely, consider whether you're dealing with temporary market conditions or genuine disinterest in technical work. The job search frustration might be influencing your desire to leave the field entirely.Non-tech pivots often require starting over salary-wise and building new professional networks. The grass isn't necessarily greener in other industries, many of which have their own challenges with job security and advancement.If you do pivot, choose something that genuinely interests you rather than just escaping current difficulties. Career changes work better when driven by positive attraction to new opportunities rather than just running away from current problems.",

You should use the STAR method as a framework without being too robotic of formulaic. It’s still a conversation. Also, it’s okay to shorten examples based on time; make sure to acknowledge the clock and be respectful of people’s time. For the question above you can do something like, “When I have a disagreement with someone I do [X]. I approach it this way because [X]. An example of me having a disagreement with someone is [X]. The outcome of [X] was [X] which I felt [X] way about because of [X].” Another approach maybe “I had a disagreement with [X] about [X] when working on this project. My approach to resolving it was [X] because [X]. The outcome was [X] which I felt [X] way about. I would do [X] differently in the future because of [X]” Obviously I’m being very general here. Find a format/style that fits you and your regular speaking cadence; but yes, even if brief, you should mention examples of when you came into this scenario they’re asking about. If they ask about a scenario you’ve never experienced you can say something like “I’ve actually not experienced [X] but here’s what I would do based on a similar [X] experience I had.” Show you’re flexible, adaptable and have learned from previous experiences.

I'll then jump into a concrete example of times I have executed this in my career typically following a loose STAR format. You have to show examples of times you have lived your philosophy.

You'll have a very hard time getting noticed unless you really stand out in some way.The other problem is that a lot of basic data science/engineering type tasks are something a good developer can knock out in their sleep, and it also doesn't take much before the task needs some custom software written and you basically need to be a developer anyway.

When we would interview people for C++ jobs, we would ask what was one thing they hated about the language, and if they didn’t have anything we could tell they hadn’t really used it in anger. But, it allows a specific balance of access to the hardware and programming abstractions that’s hard to beat. There are various C++ style guides that give advice on what small slice of the language is best to use - Google’s is pretty good, for example. Most of the C++ jobs out there are in interesting and in-demand problem areas, and often pay very well. Very few people are paying C++ devs to make CRUD apps.",

In a frontend SD video I saw a guy plan for thousands of DOM elements and dealing with a11y with incremental tabindexes. Both videos had wildly positive comments thanking the creators for teaching them.I recommend:* The Alex Xu book, just to get a sense of the concepts* Hello Interview articles (I find the videos aren't as helpful)* Kevin Fang's incident videos (not too informative but more fun)* Thinking defensively about failure modes in each part of your system* Remembering that everything is a tradeoff (<- magic word that interviewers love)",

Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here’s what I did:1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What’s the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. 2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they’re requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone. 3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can’t make the fix. This may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. You have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they’re trying to push for that fix. You’re an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time. What’s the worst that happens, they get rid of you? You were planning on quitting anyway.",

I don't know what I did during the interview, but holy air ball that this is a lot.\\- The \"make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone\" is 100%, I am writing docs and making charts as I am writing this on my break. What make me confused in my lead told me that there is no use for making charts or diagrams because it will be outdated anyway.\\- But I do think there is a sliver lining after this is I do learn a lot of stuff that SHOULD NOT BE DONE from this abomination of a codebase. When I first received this a raised some questions about it too like how things are not supposed to be returned but here we are.I hate their smug pikachu face when I tell them that ts gonna take me more time to understand and fix. I hated it more when I received a comment like \"You don't know how to debug?\"Thank you once again.",

That's not going to change.Given that constant, we get a 2nd constant. You can't work with her. That's not going to change either.Given those 2 constants, come up with your paths forward. There's not many, and they all rely on your skip.One path that solves everything is your skip decides your manager is not performing well, and they fire them. You have no idea if they'll do this, and they're certainly not gonna talk about it with you, and even if they are going to do it this could easily take 6+ months. Maybe more.If they don't do that, or you don't want to wait for something that may never happen, the next option is to tell your skip to transfer teams. *Tell*. You don't even need to explain yourself, they know whats up.If they don't let you transfer teams, then your final option is to start looking for jobs elsewhere.This won't be the last bad manager you encounter in your career. You won't be able to change this person. There's a reason it's a LinkedIN cliche to say \"employees don't leave companies, they leave managers\".",

        "body": "Building confidence in this market requires focusing on what you can control rather than external factors. Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.For quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.The harsh reality is that \"quickly\" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.Focus on financial preparation over trying to become \"layoff-proof\" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.Consider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.The confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",

That can include meetings, mandatory training, reading status update emails from others on your team, reading companywide emails, installing security updates, and so on.That leaves you with 32 hours of productive work (e.g. coding).If you switch to half-time, that overhead doesn't noticeably decrease. So now you end up with only 12 hours of productive work, which is a lot less than half.In my experience, the most junior employees are the ones who have the least overhead - so they'd probably be the least affected - but then again, they're also the least productive so I wouldn't want them to be even less productive.The most senior employees tend to have the most overhead - they're in more meetings, they email with many more groups within the company.Honestly, there are many weeks where if I only worked 20 hours, I wouldn't have time to finish a single productive task.",

I would counter him and say that he can put in some capital to offshore the work to India and you can manage them (1-2 hours a week). You will get a rough MVP that's not scalable but is sellable. Once you get some investors or income then you can take a salary + equity If you are not a cofounder then 10% is reasonable, but to me it sounds like you are so it should be closer to 20%. Unfortunately idk why he has another cofounder. Out of the 3 of you, one of you is useless and I don't think its you",

They will have a good idea of opportunities for you to get ahead, or at the very least have events where you can get in touch with companies that are hiring. They also usually do mock interviews, resume review etc., and it's good to have a solid handle on interviewing by the time you actually start doing it for internships.My biggest suggestion would be to make a lot of friends in the your major. It's crazy how much of an edge knowing people gets you in the interview process. Make friends, friends graduate / have internships, gives you a leg in. This is so overlooked in CS in my opinion. Idk if it's just not generally understood, or if people willfully ignore it because they are super introverted and/or socially anxious, but seriously - make lots of friends. And have fun along the way, because life is short and uni is a really unique time of newly realized autonomy and freedom in our budding adult lives",

Companies create BS policies so they can say in negotiations “no, that goes against the policy we made”. Be prepared to hear that.Present some labour force averages. Explain in your counter your current value (and recent big wins you’ve given the company).Asking for 15-20% seems reasonable. Although, even if you get away with that, say a 15% raise, that probably means next pay adjustment period instead of getting a ~3% adjustment they’ll just skip the raise and say “well you just got promoted and we gave you the extra little bit in negotiations”. In other words, it may just all wash out to not much in the end.Again, I’m shellshocked. You describe a company with policies in place to let them be obstinate and slow in pay raises. Since they control and purse strings and the policies, they can always point at the policies they made and say their hands are tied. That’s my experience.",

You're going for a 4-6 year degree at the age of 28, you'll be in your early or mid 30s when you're done. Assuming you're working a part time job through university that's your reality for the next 4-6 years. When I was working two years ago I was getting paid 80k out of university and the work life wasn't great, I'd be expected to work overtime regularly and if any feature crashed I would have to stop everything I'm doing and fix it (even on the weekends).Since then I haven't found solid SDE work. Most of my friends have been laid off recently as well, some from big tech some from local companies. I would strongly advise against getting into this field right now since there is no guarantee of finding a stable job by your mid 30s. If you're looking for something that would get you employed and currently has a lot of money in it I'd advise looking into business specifically accounting. Now if you want to do IT support that is out of my area of expertise.",
