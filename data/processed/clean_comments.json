With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.You had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen. I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based. So I can understand why 9 failed.You then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge. I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials. Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.But then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review. I find that odd that so many failed. Was it an experience issue with the tech stack. Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?Anything you would have wished gone different? I find the funnel here to be very lopsided. Do you think it would have been better to start with more than the 21 initial candidates?",

In terms of getting hands on \"big data\", more difficult but not impossible. There are tons of open datasets that you can practice using Spark on. Check on Kaggle, lichess, Google Big query sample data (for this one you cna get Google credits then write out these large datasets to parquet then you are good).I have to say that Spark was quite intimidating when I started around 6y ago but there are a lot of good materials out there.Edit: you will require basic sql knowledge but I would learn this via Spark APIs eg.

The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.Also, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.If you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.You can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.For a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely. The books by Kimball on data warehousing are one of such \"bibles\".Lastly, you can consider proper schools. In my country, there are short courses by local polytechnics and universities for undergrads and post-grads, with substantial government subsidies on the course fees.",

Sure you can argue that the \"medallion architecture\" is just marketing crap rebranding an idea that's been in use for decades, but pre-aggregated data serves a vital purpose when you're serving data to analysts. Just off the top of my head:- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development. Do you really want them running a monster query with tons of joins repeatedly when you could just save compute by pre-aggregating the data for them?",

Let's say, \"active customers\" which can have different meaning to different people.  Data is still normalized to certain extent in silver.

Silver is the atomic “business objects” (equivalent to fact/dim, but without the star schema). Then we have gold models for some pre-calculated/filtered/aggregated datasets, always using silver models.

I'm gonna repeat my personal take on the problem here.DE is not a junior position. You need experience as the end consumer of a data stack (or lack thereof), have some comfort with software engineering as opposed to simply \"knowing how to code\", and put in the work to learn how to build and maintain the plumbing that enables data to make its journey from source to business value. This last part takes years of work.The most common story I see (and mine is more or less the same): STEM major works as DS/DA/BI analytics/similar position. Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build. From this point you become a DE in a few months, by definition.I suggest you *don't* look for DE positions. Look for any other job as a data practitioner, and try to slowly move upstream on the data stack from there. It really does take years.",

I think consulting is honestly a very good way to get into DE. You get exposure very quickly to different industries and business functions and so you develop intuition for drilling down on and solving real business problems. You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an \"expert\". You also gain broader experience and it's a place where being a jack of all trades and self learner is greatly appreciated, which is kinda rare in UK companies.",

It is called “pocket mining” and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner. ...>Pocket hunting is an ingenious process. You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you find *no* gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.>You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the hill—for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it afterward.Mark Twain, \"Roughing It\"About sums it up.

Start small with just loading some files to a storage location (S3 or blob) and learning how to work with them there (read and write). You can do that fairly easily with pandas and python. Also sign up for a free trial on Snowflake and mess around with it. Learn how you can get data in and query it. I would do this after you do the above because in most companies you would be loading data to snowflake from a cloud storage location. Edit: hit save too early",

One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.What I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer. We are eying that currently, and I think we will save around 50% on our Snowflake bill.",

What incurs cost in each platform. I really didn't like the idea of being charged for a 10Mb scan evertime I did an INFORMATION_SCHEMA query in BigQuery.Vertica was so fast it was scary, but then it would be, its one of Dr Stonebraker's babies. It does take some managing though. Its available on GCP through the marketplace.In AWS you have Postgres compatible Aurora as a serverless option. That is good for up to 10Tb. GCP is Google Cloud SQL. These might be appropriate for your needs.Snowflake. Its like people who really know DBs sat down and thought \"Lets take all the best bits we've seen, make the ugly bits pretty and easy to use. Lets minimise management\". I'm a huge fan of it, even considering the hands on experience I have with alternatives.Cost wise, it really is pay for use. Basic common sense applies.Cost monitoring should be a priority. Dashboards that autorefresh frequently when they don't need to must be hunted down and shot.People who use SELECT * need reeducating again....and again. It is possible to block its use with a row policy but that can cause more problems than it is worth .One thing that shocks me with clients is that if they have budgetted X, with a bit of leeway, then they don't care if it costs significantly less. Cost savings don't excite them. Revenue generation does!",

BigQuery gives 10GB of storage and 1TiB of query data processed per month for free. Not just that, in BigQuery you can partition your data on various field and time, which optimizes your query processing to use less resources and manage costs. Big Query's Active storage costs $0.02 per GB which you will be charged around $20 each TB after 1 TB coz first 1TB each month is free. In snowflake it's around $40 and no free storage.And as long as Postgres is concerned, you can use a hybrid in which you can use it for smaller transactional data which you might not want to store for longer period, like logs, sessions, and sometimes historical data, you can use it for quick processing for your SaaS and use Data Warehouse for analytical use cases because as your data will grow Postgres will start to slow down in processing, but data warehouse will be great for processing big data, using this approach will significantly optimize your cost and boost your use case.",

        "body": "This is the wrong way to think about this.Snowflake is a consumption based pricing model. It's not really about the size of your data at all. It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.They give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.It scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.BUTthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \\*and\\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.It's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.So the math is simple:DIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (\"Free!\\*\\*\\*\") + a lot of opex (\"pay people to manage it\") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)PaaS/SaaS is higher capex (\"Snowflake is expensive!\") + very little opex (\"this thing runs itself\") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.So in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.When my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: \"When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.\"PS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price. Don't think of it as \"needlessly\" expensive - think of it as \"am I going to use it in a way to deliver the value I'm trying to pay for?\"",

The rest is compute, so that’s hard to estimate, but I don’t think your use cases will be too heavy. I could imagine you end up with a bill of 100-200 dollars per month.For that amount of money, you should save yourself the troubles of self-hosting an open source DWH.

We've seen tons of companies move from exactly your setup (PowerBI + expensive compute that runs 24/7) to ClickHouse and it usually works really well for retail drill-down scenarios (we have a very large retail customer at Tinybird doing exactly that - unfortunately I can't mention them by name).ClickHouse is that is quite literally built for this kind of workload - fast aggregations across massive datasets with arbitrary groupings. Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.A few things to consider though:1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?Druid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.I'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions. But yeah, this seems like exactly the kind of problem ClickHouse was designed to solve.",

The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values. * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows. * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred. For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year? All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT. * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns * etc, etc, etc, etcFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",

Great developers produce great modules or sub-systems, but don't know or care about the whole enterprise system the way you do.The thing to do is to be very politically cognizant. Do you have Directors and CTO's that are wise and trustworthy. Become simply more visible to them. They are always scared of system weaknesses and failures. Be the one who concretely reassures them.

Since I’ve been out of college for a long time and never had much exposure to those concepts, catching up feels like a hard climb.I’ve been trying to master Spark and other DE concepts, and while I’ve made progress, it hasn’t translated into higher-paying opportunities yet.On the client-facing side, I do enjoy talking to people and building relationships — in fact, that’s one of my biggest strengths and part of the reason my career in IT has been semi-successful so far. This makes me wonder if a pivot into Inside Sales or Pre-Sales might be a better fit, since it combines technical skills with people skills.Financially, I’m not very stable right now — more or less living hand-to-mouth while supporting my family. This makes it harder to take big risks, though I am eager to find a path that brings both stability and growth.So I’m torn: should I double down on becoming more technical (even if it’s a longer climb), or pivot into a solutions/Pre-Sales role that might leverage my natural strengths and offer quicker growth?",

Their day to day KPI and process jargon. You need to translate your insight into something they understand on *their* terms, not yours. Basically put yourself into their shoes and rewrite every slide deck you have to depending on the audience. You need to get used to the idea that these are different languages or dialects you have to learn to speak. There's no real short cut except practice and exposure. Know when you can afford to geek out and when you need to dumb down and what your goal is when you are presenting. When you've mastered that slide deck presentation, you can also apply that principle to your emails, learning to write differently when addressing the emails to different stakeholders to get what you want.",

We're encouraged to use these to understand different aspects of the company. When you understand what they do, how they're talking with their counterparts you get a better feel for what they need communicated. Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.- Talking with people directly, asking: \"hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?\"- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.Maybe \"Storytelling with data\" is helpful for some situations?- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. - Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.Generally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).If you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.If, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.Pay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.----tl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself. You've never worked in this field, it's not appropriate to have expectations. Become a student again. Focus on learning the needs of the role, not on yourself / your self-doubt / your perception of yourself.",

Interview hiring managers, explain your intention in your career path for the future, ask what technologies they're hiring for.Identify 2 or 3 real, long-term careers that way (one technology = not a career), learn only that specific thing/career (nothing else matters), maybe get certified for it (optional), and interview for junior/medior positions while being honest about your career path and skills.Learn only what matters for that specific position. Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.Find yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.I would say \"that's it\", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.But the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",

To me what sets candidates apart is to talk about where dbt can go wrong in a project and what are the best practices, alerts, and team education you can put in place to help manage dbt complexity.For example, people often complain about dbt’s spaghetti DAGs where model lineage is impossible to trace. I would ask a candidate 1) what is the software engineering concept not being followed that is causing this mess (my answer: lack of DRY models and not having one purpose per model) 2) How would you go about fixing this? (my answer: start with a model used for BI consumption, understand its source tables and columns, check column level lineage for each column, come up with a plan to consolidate intermediate models after understanding each column calculation) 3) How do you prevent this in the future? (My answer: create a strong culture of preplanning and peer review, alerting based on some measure of DAG messiness in the CI pipeline)Going from “I just know general dbt concepts and execute them” to “I can make your data ecosystem stronger with my dbt skills and promote of a culture of engineering excellence” will take you way further.",

The shift toward treating data infrastructure more like software has been one of the biggest changes I've seen over the past few years.I think the \"data is too messy\" argument is kinda missing the point though. Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.The schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general \"data as code\" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.The local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.I guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges. Like CI/CD for data pipelines needs to handle things like data quality checks, schema validation, backfill strategies etc that traditional software CI/CD doesn't really deal with.",

When you are ready, you will know you are. Data Engineering is like getting a Ph.D in random intertwined data problem solving. It's not entry level, and it's certainly not something you can do with a class or two. Start with analytics, dashboards, learn where the pipelines go, and then start moving up. Once you understand the processes going on, find the next process in line. Keep doing this until you can look at data and understand the whole business use case and story behind the data you're looking at. This takes a long time.",

If you are planning to shift to DE externally after a year or so, I would recommend you position your CV in a way that is conveys you were more into the DE part of the job and less on the analyst. Data titles may be 1 Dimensional, but the roles we do within the organization are usually an intersection of Analyst/Science/ Engineer.

For example the NFL starts next week, you could scrape fantasy football rankings from multiple sites and calculate each player's average rank (or some other analysis). Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).Then it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.Sports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time. This sort of thing is a common use case for a simple but non-trivial data pipeline.",

The worst offender I have seen is college basketball with 360+ teams and they (different APIs) ALL use different team names/abv/date formats and timezones.

In terms of naming/partitioning, it’s going to depend on how you plan on referencing that data. Is the raw data layer the only place you’re going to store the data while using a data lake query engine for analytics? Will you transform read and write it to your next layer? If the former, you probably want to consider a meaningful partitioning strategy based on query patterns to help with predicate push down/partition pruning. If you’re going to move it to another system (like synapse) or file (parquet based file store) then id recommend using an ingestion time partition strategy.I usually like to do something like: source_name/object_name/ingestion_date=/.jsonAlso, bronze is usually synonymous with raw, but at the end of the day these terms are just trying to bucket specific concepts into language so nothing is perfect.",

        "body": "TL;DR: gather requirements and build something that works for YOUR use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.I personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. The medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. You architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. With that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. One last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",

We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.That's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.Maybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.As far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.That being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.However, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like \"I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?\" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.For example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.Having said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as \"bronze\" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.For your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an \"analytics\" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",

The simplest approach without knowing your tooling, level of effort available, number of users/pipelines/reports would be to create a report that keys off a table holding runtime information for your different data pipelines.An easier way would be to have the dataset name (meaningful to the analysts), the runtime datetime, expected interval, and is_stale flag set to 0 or 1 if the last updated + interval is greater than the current datetime. You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. If analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale. This will depend on your analysts tooling though and if they’re viewing raw data, using bi tools, etc. You could also use something as simple as an email group with email notifications when pipelines fail. I don’t recommend this personally, but it might be quick if you need this done fast.",

Therefore we also have a third one, which is a subset of the snapshot but only with active users, so we can maybe get it down to 30% of the size.So in joins - we join on the date and userid with the transactional and then use the snapshot (with active users) as a fallback on date -1 if there were no changes on the day we process.This has reduced the data scanned massively and also improved performance in all measures.Edit: typos",

Here is the short excerpt from it:If you just need to know whether your cron jobs or data scripts ran and succeeded (plus error details for debugging), PulseHook is way simpler and cloud-agnostic. It’s built for developers who want fast setup and easy alerts. AWS CloudWatch is much more powerful but focused on deep infrastructure/app monitoring for everything in AWS—great for big teams, but overkill if you just want lightweight job status alerts.

If you happen to experience bugs or anything weird please report as a Github issue or in the #dbt-fusion-engine community slack channel2. you're right to call out that the Fusion CLI and VS Code extension are different things, but overlap slightly.3. Forgive me if I get long-winded, I'm a former teacher, so always love a good lecture / teaching opportunity. Please let me know what of my explanation clicks (and what doesn't!)On launch three months ago, we published the blog: [The Components of the dbt Fusion engine and how they fit together](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components). It's worth a full read, but I wanted to paraphrase the section about [the VS Code extension and Language Server](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#the-dbt-vs-code-extension-and-language-server).There's actually 3 components worth calling out:1. The Fusion CLI binary (basically the equivalent of dbt Core but in Rust)2. The Fusion Language Server binary (a.k.a LSP)3. The VS Code extensionA language server share a great deal of code with the Fusion CLI but it's intended user is not a human in a terminal, but rather an IDE who can talk to it on behalf of the user. When you download or update the VS Code extension you might notice that in the bottom status bar it will say: \"Downloading file\" that's the extension grabbing the latest version of the Language Server from our CDN.In it there's a pretty diagram (made by yours truly) that shows that the VS Code extension has two buckets of features broken out by the binary that powers them1. **by the CLI**: running commands, previewing models2. **by the LSP**: intellisense, lineage, go to reference In a comment >So can I access the enhanced features in fusion without using the extension in another IDE?Theoretically, the Fusion LSP could be made to work with and distributed such that it could work with other IDEs like you say. However, the reality is today that it only works with VS Code and VS Codium-based IDES (i.e. Cursor & Windsurf). If we hear of enough demand for other IDEs (emacs, JetBrains), we'll certainly make it happen there as well.",

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. The other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",

You highlighted my exact concern, bringing this up in the regular meetings is basically pointing a finger at someone and that's not my intent but right now is the best time to fix this as we just redesigned and I don't know how much is dependent on it yet. Unfortunately the people id have to pull in to answer those questions wouldn't consider it a priority. I took this job to learn about organizing, culture and workflow of larger teams and unfortunately it's been more frustrating than educational. By the time the problems get to the devs it's far too late to do anything about it, I really wish we could have useful design reviews but that was something I was hoping to learn at this job.

They also take the flak when things are slow, don’t pan out, or aren’t as useful as they expected. Ideally, with good leadership principles, this is transparent to the rest of the team but also not in a way that makes the team feel unsafe. These relationships are built on trust, good examples, work ethic, and competence. But that good leadership is VERY VERY hard to find. Even at big FAANG companies.

Also curious if you're planning to land the data in Delta Lake or use something like Synapse?FWIW, Estuary handles CDC with minimal setup and works well with most of your stack (Oracle, Salesforce, etc), and you don't need to run any infra. I work there, so obviously biased, but it’s been great for hybrid teams that want CDC without becoming experts in it.",

While Synthea can build CCDA and FHIR, we also are lacking EDI X12's big time.The MS CCDA/HL7 -> FHIR converter is meh. We still hit the same issues... mappings mappings mappings.As someone who interviews DE's in this field (in the US)... if you want to demonstrate you understand these datamodels, just put a bunch of ADT's in a dataframe and display a chart. Doesn't need to be more than that. If you wanna do something fancy, you could do something with CQL on FHIR (this would cover all kinds of topics and show you know how to work with a real world problem/scenario).Good luck homie.",

Synthea produces pretty clean data, at least in the sense that I believe it places data in the fields where they need to go, the fields are used as intended, and the data is relatively predictable. Do you have any recommendations on how I could implement the types of issues that require mapping the data to expected outputs?",

The best thing to do is to think of a personal problem you want to solve (my first project was a web scraper that found upcoming shows for artists I like in my area, I still maintain it 8 years later) — and make it fullish stack. Some backend DB, like Postgres, some python data wrangling, some analytical processes using duck db, and then a UI of some sort for fun like a UI to trigger jobs or view reports. I would suggest pasting the above snippet to chat gpt and asking for a real breakdown starter project template — but then refraining from asking it to do anymore.

I'm good with python, SQL and I'm learning tools like pyspark, using databrics etc. What are my chances like to land a DE job after I get 2-3 projects on my profile and get more proficient with the tools. A brief roadmap for me would be appreciated, so I can be in the right path.Also what are the specific DSA concepts I should be well versed with to help me land and be good a DE job.",

Perhaps different to where you are in the world, although realistically speaking you better be pretty fucking good and experienced if you're going to demand contracting rates which are typically quite high for an engineer. For example, I have a friend who contracts for a big pharma company in a Senior position managing clinical trials. I have looked at day rates for a standard DE role here in the UK. Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.Aside from that, this requires a mindset shift. As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, \"what jobs am I good enough for?\" which eventually devolved to \"will I ever be good enough?\".The cycle is this - you apply for jobs. You get nothing back - you go away and improve your existing code, take another look at your CV/resume, you continue learning. You get something back, your profile and the job market conditions are in the right place. You keep repeating until you get something back.There are no secrets, hacks, or shortcuts. It's just a case of staying in the race long enough until you get your chance.",

And there's now an observe increase in *users* asking questions where it's obvious it's chatgpt inbetween the user and the forums. Also across reddit I find questions being asked by a user with almost no activity and responses from a SaaS company pretty quickly which feels like staged promotions.I don't know that I've learned anything from the communities I follow on Reddit related to tech in quite some time. I mainly look at them in downtime between meetings at work. Conference presentations at 2x speed where I can skip the last 15% that turns into a pitch for their company seem to have the most relevant info.

Most companies won’t expect miracles from you in your first role (assuming you are young - early 20s or less). So I’d say most important is what you bring to the role, good attitude, energy and an openness to learning and developing skills. Like mentioned before, be proactive in understanding how the product or application (s) you are working on really works. Sketch the data pipelines, the tech stack and how they fit in together. Talk to seniors when you have questions. Identify areas that are bottlenecks, have legacy systems and that can be improved. Try not to change large blocks, but find small things you can improve. This will give you confidence to do bigger things. Reading books and doing courses are okay, but you learn most by solving real problems. So always focus on finding problems and solving them.

You can use a custom encoding fine tuned on task specific output layers but 99% of the vibe coders don’t know this.2. OCR works great if you use the right OCR. Cloud based OCR APIs from Azure, AWS, Google. All can be set up securely and are 10-100x cheaper than LLMs.3. Find the right tool. Look into successors of LayoutLM specifically built for charts. Though at the end of the day this is a hard problem and most likely an XY question type ask.If this really is the client’s data and they’re not scraping charts from some other data source, why can’t you just recreate the charts with their data? If they are scraping charts from other places, are they able to extract the raw SVG or similar vector format? If you can get the raw vectorized image you can pull out the information manually without AI.",

You can read Athena tables in Glue because it reads the underlying S3 data, but you cannot write to Athena tables the same way you do in the Athena console. The recommended approach is to perform the transformation and insertion entirely within Glue: first, read the source data from S3 into a Glue DynamicFrame, then apply any necessary transformations using PySpark, and finally write the results back to the target S3 location in the correct format (e.g., Parquet). This way, Glue handles ETL, and Athena is used for querying, avoiding the unsupported pattern of executing Athena queries from Glue.",

This is actually a recommended approach when you need to split data from a single collection into multiple destination tables.Here's how it works:1. First, you need to define logical partitions in your collection by specifying one or more fields as partition keys:```collections:  acmeCo/user-sessions:    schema: session.schema.yaml    key: [/user/id, /timestamp]    projections:      country:        location: /country        partition: true      device:        location: /agent/type        partition: true      network:        location: /agent/network        partition: true```2. Then, in your materialization, you can use partition selectors to direct specific partitions to different tables:```materializations:  acmeCo/example/database-views:    endpoint: ...    bindings:      - source:          name: acmeCo/anvil/orders          partitions:            include:              customer: [Coyote]        resource: { table: coyote_orders }```",

The typical reason anyone would go with the startup here is that they know the founding team and are legitimately excited about working with them and their vision.Building a Data Platform form the ground up and using AI agents is pretty commoditized at this point, and you didn't say any likely value for the equity in the unlikely event that it pays off (nor did you address the possibility of share dilution during the long 4 year vest).

There are plenty of ways to add additional capabilities, for example the different serdes for file formats. And you can bring in different libraries from the jvm.

I'm not sure what exactly *the* small files problem is or what *your* problem is in particular, but if you're looking to, say, keep only the latest values based on some key across multiple files, you have a few options.One option is as I described: compaction. Go across your files and grab only the most recent data you want/need, merge into a new file, discard the old ones. Whether you want to implement this and how kinda depends on your exact data needs, so it's hard to say. At the very latest, I'd do this before archiving any data.The other is to just track all changes in the data in your silver layer and grab the latest value. It's not really solving the small files problem though. Worst case scenario is just appending the files into a large file and keeping track of the file from which it came (or timestamp, whichever is more important).",

Here are my recommendations:* Prefer Parquet over CSV.* Unload only the needed columns/rows.* Make sure PARALLEL is ON (it’s the default).* If you’re using SSE-KMS, large exports can hit KMS TPS limits.* Put the Redshift subnets on an S3 Gateway VPC endpoint. If traffic goes via a NAT Gateway, it can be a bottleneck (and pricey).* Avoid casts/joins/orderings in the UNLOAD query. Precompute into a temp table, then UNLOAD.",

In my experience, finding client or server side code hard depends mostly on your familiarity with both the technologies being used, and the codebase. Once you become more familiar, they become less hard, whether frontend or backend. The complexity of backends can relate largerly to the distribution of services and their interaction with one another. This requires the ability to store a large, and complex mental model, which can be difficult. Frontends can contain complex physics based animations, or complex state interactions, which also involve having a clear mental model. Either one requires familiarity with the concepts and the codebase. If you are finding backend code harder to understanding, you'll get there. You just need to spend time reading the code, reading the docs, and learning about the technologies, and things will become clearer.

        "body": "It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:When someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their \"first\" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the \"21st\" century even though the year begins with \"20\" and not \"21\". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').In many buildings throughout the world, the \"1\" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's \"nice\" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is \"0\" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.(Side note: This \"number of floors offset from the ground\" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).Here is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a \"0\" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a \"1\" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.It might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \\* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the \"group index\" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.The above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \\[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.I'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",

I think it just made sense to the people making compilers for various programming languages to start with the first available byte value, which is all zeros, which comes out to a decimal zero. I also suspect this is related to the limitations of early systems. Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought \"Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.\" I think starting from the first available byte value, instead of skipping it, appeals to that tradition as much as it's just natural to do.",

You've been doing it on your own all along. What they have done is they've slowly led you down a shared pathway. They have fed content to you in drips and given you time to consume that experience and then master it. But it's still you learning,University isn't like that. You've got 3-4 years to learn advanced topics. Semesters are shorter. Terms are shorter again. Assignments are bigger. > projectsThere are not a huge number of project groups in first year because they can't be sure you know anything. My advice for projects is to be the guy driving everything. You'll do more and deal with more useless team members. But you'll be doing more and not at risk of being the useless team member. > networkingThis isn't a skill that university teaches explicitly. Join clubs and societies at your local university. Check out local meetups in your space and start participating. > learning on my ownThe wealth of human knowledge exists on your phone. You know what content the university is teaching, even if you don't think they are doing it well. I 100% guarantee that there is some person on the internet who's doing a bang-up job of teaching that content. In my case, it was random people on youtube with thick accents who helped me understand the content that I was struggling with.",

What actually keeps you moving is discipline and consistency. Make a schedule, stick to it, and just keep showing up.Here’s the thing: once you stop, it’s surprisingly hard to come back — even if you used to love coding or learning before. That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.Also, a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.All these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong. Sometimes one carries you, sometimes another. But they only start working for you once you actually start and keep going. You might feel like some of these things don't apply to you but they will in their due time when you are at it.",

        "body": "\"programming\" has many different areas/typessome are better on windows, some are better on linux, some it makes no difference at allthere are some advantages that come from using the same operating system that the software you are writing will run oneg if you are building something that will be ran as a native app on windows then it will be more convenient to use windows for development tooif you are writing the backend for a website that is expected to run on a linux server, then it will be convenient to use a similar flavour of linux for development (debian / rhel / etc)they are mainly because it will simplify installing dependencies + testing eg as a hypothetical situation, lets say you want to learn PHP to build some dynamic websites, if your server is running ubuntu but your dev machine is running windows, you need to learn how to set up php and your other dependencies first on windows and then again on linux, if you used ubuntu on your dev machine too then you only have to learn once, you are also less likely to run into issues caused by subtle differences between the OS'on flip side lets say you are writing a game in c++ which you want to run natively on windows, but your development machine is running ubuntu, getting the basic window of your game to open up and receive input actually requires OS specific functions, eg for windows there is a \"Win32\" API that you have to call, which is only available on windows, linux does have its own version but then that only works on linux.problem 2 is that DirectX (the main graphics api used by windows + xbox games) is only available on windows, there are cross platform alternatives but that is something to considerall of these problems, and pretty much anything else OS specific, can be solved via virtualisation. eg the php on windows you could use WSL or some other solution to get a linux VM or even better imo use containers (which docker for windows will manage a linux vm for you behind the scenes)the windows game on linux i think there is wine or options for running a windows VM which can allow running windows appspersonally my advice / what i do, if i am building a windows native app i will just use my windows machineif i am building for a linux server or an embedded device i will use a linux VM (i have an Ubuntu 22.04 VM which has most of my projects in)if i am building something as a cross platform app then i use whichever i feel like depending on the project, eg standalone little Java desktop apps i generally use windows, if im building an electron based client for an api ive written i will use linux because most likely that API is set up to run in my linux VMreasons- i use windows as my main/host OS because the apps i want to run on windows are the most performance sensitive + most dependence on the direct hardware eg GPU- i run linux in a VM rather than dual boot/another machine tbh because i found that most convenient, i did use to dual boot on my old laptop but having to close everything and reboot every time i wanted to switch between them was a PITA, with a VM i can have my linux VM on 1 screen and my windows host on the other with shared clipboard between them",

Programming isn’t a justifiable reason to jump to Linux. Of course, Linux is better suited for a tech person, and a lot of programming tools come with better compatibility for Linux, but these specific examples are so few and far in between, and with WSL working well enough, hopping on to Linux isn’t a question of “can I program better in it”. Instead, it’s a question of having and maintaining a whole OS mostly on your own- which doesn’t have much to do with programming.",

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.It's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.Lastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up. If you dislike maths I'd have a good think about whether you dislike actually puzzling over it or whether your education system has constantly thrown you challenges beyond your comfort level and never given you the chance and support to address your weaker spots.Some actual learning advice / resources:On the maths front, Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud is my top pick for a zero to hero maths book if it's of interest as it really starts from the fundamentals.If you like Python, automate the boring stuff with python is a fantastic resource, available as a website, courses on Udemy, a book, whatever floats your boat.Outside of that, honestly just do some coding puzzles online. Codingbat, codingames, codewars and loads more. Leetcode is there too but is probably best left for later once you're feeling up to it.3 months to do some well directed self study is gold. Take it steady and I'm sure you'll see some real progress.",

Key is to stay consistent, build logic-> stay practical for good understanding, note- If u feel stuck, go online look for the code no problem but the thing is you have to ask why why did person use this instead of this.eg: we can print this\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* simply as print(\\*); but for easy and quick we row 5;for i in range(1, rows + 1):print(\"\\*\" \\* i)",

I went the opposite route and learned the programming first and then had to go back and learn all the theory (don’t recommend this route). I wouldn’t stress it tbh, and if you’re dead set on starting to learn a language then probably start with Python as it’ll be easier to at least read and comprehend while learning the basics. The nice thing about programming languages is once you understand programming and know a language well, picking up other ones is a lot less daunting and is generally just a matter of learning syntax and any language specific things (this varies by language). There plenty of free courses on YouTube through free code camp.

Have a crap ton of relevant certifications. Certifications are great because you can do them on your own time, and they are basically diplomas that prove to the job market that you have specific knowledge they can use, not just general knowledge in IT.Check out this to find out if you want to get an idea on which jobs you can do within IT:[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/)Also, and I cannot stress this enough: Make a Github profile, and start making hobby projects. The sooner the better. It took me three weeks to create my first game in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript using MVC pattern (don't even worry about what that means, you'll find out). The game SUCKED, but it was mine, and I loved it. And I published it on Github Pages, and it's still up.Mastering programming is all about solving problems. Well, your problem right now is that you only know basic HTML. That's fine, because if you're a programmer you understand that the position you're in right now is exactly where a seasoned senior developer is, but from a different vantage point. Whereas they have to solve huge problems that can make companies lots of money, or save them costs, the only problem you have to solve is how to get better at programming. Take it as an enormous privilege and get started.",

Some people advise starting on a project immediately, but I personally disagree with this until you have some fundamentals under your belt. (Just my experience). Also, another piece of advice, find a language and stick with it for awhile. When I first learned programming, I kept agonizing on which specific language to learn, but the reality is that really doesn't matter all that much. Most of the concepts you master in one language will translate to another.Oh and 17 is not late to start coding, I didn't start to learn how to code more than a tiny bit until I was in my late 20s. I'd say you're doing quite well :)Edit: One other thing to note. You might find in college you might grow to like math more btw. When I was in high school, I also hated math a lot. What I realized later on, was that a lot of that was how it was taught in my high school. A lot of my math classes in high school were just straight memorization of formulas and I despised every moment of it. Once I got to college though, I actually learned how to think mathematically, how those formulas are derived and proven, and learned that math is actually quite beautiful. Just a thought to consider.",

You don't need to collect languages. They come and go (from your mind) easily. What does \"finished C\" and \"doing C++\" mean to you? You learn the syntax and semantics of a language to *use* it. If you've put effort into learning some C, you should write some software in it. You'll retain very little unless you do. It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...As for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).In summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C. Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more \"lower level\" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn. Not essential, I believe, but useful. I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.As far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy. Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language. With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system. But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post. I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language. The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C. Sounds like what you're interested in. C++ is not C, but I suspect that you might be able to use C++ for those problems as well and get some similar out of it. Hope that helps.",

The difference is just what you need it for. The biggest thing you need to get comfortable doing is breaking things down into smaller steps. Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of. The trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up \"JS how to add 3 + 5\", look up \"JS how to add two numbers.\" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs? You'll always have to look those up. Not because you won't understand them, but because the specifics are always unique to whatever you're doing.",

Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. 2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and \"first steps\", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. 3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later. Another important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. And the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need.

Ask somebody (friends, or on this post like you did) 2. Use AI, start liking it, it is future and the sooner you hop on, the easier it gets. 3. Try , try , try ,try ,try ,try ,try and after that repeat. All you have to do is try , problem is that people will be burn out easly. You can do some interactive youtube videos where you work more than listen. 4. Give yourself some goal, some smaller on for begining and find what you need, for example you mentioned games: Idea - rock paper scissors game Plan - some simple 2d models of hands showing rock paper and scissors Start - Find some good language for that. You can do it by youserlf, or type it to google or even better to AI, after you winth a language for that (or some tool like unity) You will need menu, again do what you can and if you are missing some crucial steps (like you dont know how to border text or etc) just use google. I mean using AI is simple way, but googling everything by yourself will teach you more.",

Now my project is way beyond that initial tutorial, but it helped to see what that person did to implement the things I wanted to do also.\\- With new things like MCP, Agentic AI, those I google a lot more because AI tends to not get those right and reading the docs is a better way I find.

Play around, get creative. Goldplate it (which means do extra). This happens in the real world, we refine our code (or iteration).Do PROJECTS. Focus on your Git skills. Learn topics not studied in classes. You have no idea how many new grads we get who don't even now how to merge or what rebase means which leads us to declining them.Work with friends on silly projects. Silly little projects lead to exponential gains as you learn from each other. Do code reviews of each others Labs. Maybe Dave knows something Bob doesn't, so Dave can let Bob know of this and now Bob knows this and he can pass that knowledge onto others. This way you learn of branching, merging, rebasing and the rest to keep your branches up to date with others.You can make friends with your teachers, because guess what? They were just like you. You never know what kind of insight they can give you.Always ask questions. Something doesn't make sense? Who cares if its a silly question, you are PAYING to be there.For reference:When I was in school, I took 7 classes a semester and still practice coding 2-3hrs a night. It seems like a lot, 2-3hrs? \"are you kidding?!\" No. 2-3hrs is so small, you might not even get any code written while you are learning how to, for example: API REST points for a silly CRUD app.My friend group which was roughly \\~7 of us, all code reviewed each other, would hang out in Skype (oh god I'm old) and just do silly little things. We would all work on projects (not all 7 at the same time) and we would knit pick each other, say \"man this is stupid, do it this way\".Not only will you make friends, you are all uplifting each other, and you will all succeed because that group work is more beneficial in skill than working on a Lab in your class.BUT MOST OF ALL?Have fun.

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.Universities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. I took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.Anyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. I wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language. One of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",

Or to be very specific in a domain I already know very well (so I can accept the pace of the video and still have critical thinking).Learning is doing. And watching a video while doing it is impractical because: you should look at one thing at a time and you should define the rhythm of your learning. Unfortunately, videos are imposing their rhythm. Using a text doc allows you to scan fast the content and move around the doc. Focusing on your code, switching when you need. Finding the right information and avoiding the sugar coating that takes ages of your time.When learning coding, you should be doing things. Not watching someone else do something. The solution presented always looks logical. And you feel you learnt something. But you actually just jump over a whole lot of questions in your brain that you don't even know you need to answer.

Lol and it goes in the opposite way too like what if you get bored and want to stop? Won't you stop or will you be forcing yourself(sometimes it's called a disciple but that's not what I'm trying to convey here)But if it's a hobby you can go as far as you want and also stop if you want so it's your choice to be a hobbyist if you want and i say it can take you farrr in most of the things",

        "body": "* **_Code Complete_ by Steve McConnell.** Strengths: provides a strong, comprehensive foundation for how to think about programming and software engineering that I recommend to all developers. Weaknesses: the book is on the long side; the book is a bit dated, so no mention of open source, cloud, CI/CD, TDD, etc; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with no mention of functional programming. * **_Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin.** Strengths: an excellent guide to writing code that is readable, maintainable, changeable, and testable; includes tons of examples, so instead of getting just a list of \"rules\" to follow, you get to see how to iteratively improve code, step by step. Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique. Weaknesses: it's hard to be an expert in so many different languages, so some of the chapters are stronger than others.",

        "body": "It can be hard to put these into practice. You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. Your priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.Also, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.So, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.My advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.You can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.There's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.For example, I encountered something similar to the following: code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30Let's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.It would read better as boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) { return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 || taxCode == 30; }Even if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.The other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.If you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.There are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",

It's very user friendly as far as programming languages go, there's a ton of useful libraries that can help you work with data, and it's easy to get things up and running quickly. You're a lot more likely in that case to want small scripts to pull data from different sources and present it to you in a more usable fashion, or maybe do your own calculations, things like that, I'm guessing? Or do you mean you want to write software for the finance industry? Java isn't glamorous but it's widely used. There's not really a roadmap of languages to learn though. It really just depends on what you want to do with it.",

But I think that what you should learn is not ‘a programming language’ but the language of variables, functions, loops, if-else statements, data types etcetera, because you’ll find those in all programming languages.",

If your end goal is making games for a console, it's not going to be an issue at all to start in those languages. To directly answer your question, i would advise picking an ergonomic language to let you focus on learning the fundamentals instead of fighting the quirks of the language. Relative to BASIC or assembly, C will feel much easier",

If you wanted to change the UI, you should be able to do so without going near the program code.Good examples of this in the real world are games and websites. A game calculates the stuff you see separately from the stuff that makes the game work. In a modern 3D game, all the “stuff you see” happens on the GPU, but the game functions run on the CPU. In a web app like Reddit, the UI runs on your browser/phone and gives you a text box to write a post, but when you hit submit a whole other computer (the server) handles that text you enter, storing it in a database and making it visible to other users each running their own UI.",

The first is to write a test harness that, once it passes, then you know the task is done.Like today I was stuck trying to build this new user story and ended up just making a really long cypress test that setup the environment to where the feature was relevant and walked through all the necessary steps. It failed (of course) but it failed quickly and showed the exact spot where it was failing so I could keep changing something, run the test, change something, run the test until it could run all the way through.I think that solves one cause of this which is constantly trying to remember how to get to the spot where the thing you’re working on pops up.Another cause is when I have to make something that involves several layers of abstraction. For that I like starting on one end and just sprinkling assert statements with detailed messages as I go. That way I don’t end up with a spaghetti mess of code that I’m trying to fix across several files.Hope that helps :)",

And in this space, PHP is still a powerhouse.

The spotlight today is on scalable, secure frontends, and that’s where JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Knockout dominate. Add to that the industry’s move toward headless architecture and microservices, and you’ll see why frontend innovation is driving a lot of excitement.Meanwhile, Python has carved its own path. Thanks to the AI/ML revolution, it’s become the go-to language for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The beauty? If you know Python, you’re not limited—you can work on AI/ML and build web applications too.In short: PHP isn’t going anywhere, but the battlefield has expanded.

Doesn't hugely matter which language you do that with, though I generally recommend a statically typed user-friendly language like C# or Java for that. LLMs are very helpful if you use them to learn instead of using them to not learn. An LLM is basically your own personal stackoverflow that responds instantly and won't call you names no matter how stupid your questions are. You can probably even ask it to generate you exercises appropriate for your level and grade them. They are also good at debugging (especially cryptic errors) and solving technical issues. You can't really rely on college to teach you those fundamentals, since a lot of courses are kinda awful even when you aren't cheating through them. Back when I was in college, most people who didn't start learning programming before college struggled. You have to get into the mindset is that learning to program is your own responsibility and college is there just to give you a piece of paper that says you did.",

You should do fine as long as you focus on the tasks in front of you, and perhaps you’ll recognize some syntax and concepts that are familiar from your Java course.",

I wouldn't worry that you're wasting time by learning the wrong thing. There is no wrong thing if you're learning and writing code.Here's the only recipe you need: (1) think of something you want to build, then (2) figure out everything you'd need to learn to build that, and then (3) learn those things. Then keep doing that until the things you're building are the kinds of things employers want.Much, much later, when your skills are good and you can build things successfully, you can start looking for what specific things employers are asking for and filling in gaps.

Do you want to level up your Leetcode-esque coding interview skill? Sure. Do you want to level up your programming skills in general?

Good times!It depends what interests you. I started with C++, which was good because it's one of the most popular and well-supported languages there is, but it's relatively hard to get into. That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.Today I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.You can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.Python I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.Definitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",

There's a tradeoff, like you can write an engine in a comparatively slow language like Python, get the project done quicker and still have that performance not be your biggest bottleneck, but it depends how high you want to aim.",

        "body": "\"roblox coding\" uses a real language called lua, it's a pretty good language and used by many other things, you can make a gui using love2d and leverage some knowledge you already have. I recommend you check out https://chessprogramming.org it's one of the best resources for chess programming and has everything you need to know, most of the examples in there are in C, some disagree but i say C is one of the best first languages since you have to actually understand how things work, no import doThing from thingDoer but it takes way longer to actually get something cool you can look at, if you want to go with C raylib provides a great starting point for the more annoying things. The youtube channel \"Sebastian Lague\" has a small series about chess programming that is way more approachable than the wiki (but way less explanatory) that is also a great introduction, his code is in C# using the Unity game engine, unity has a lot of resources and is another great option, Godot is also an option. Python and javascript are the two most common \"starting languages\", i personally don't recommend starting from higher level languages as it's much easier to understand additional abstractions learning from low level languages than to unlearn them moving from high level languages, but there's plenty of resources for both, for python the best option would be probably pygame and js can just run directly in the browser. My recommendation would be to stick with lua that you already know, chess programming is not easy and adding learning a whole new language on top would make it way more difficult.",

I think people get too reliant on AI rather than reading documentation themselves. I don't really agree with putting AI in the driver's seat, but if you're experienced enough to be able to fact check the model you're using, then I guess that's better than just relying on it to do everything for you.I also use AI at times to explain something, rather than write my code for me.

You can then try to build little more advanced apps.You just repeat this for a couple months and you will be making stuff you couldn’t even dream about when you started. Your calculator app you created will become a complete joke and you’ll probably consider just deleting it.A paid course will not teach you anything you can’t find on google.

I had to take a lot of math, as an electrical engineering student. I was slow to catch on, but I loved computer science. Computer science is more than coding. Trying to pull trig and algebra patterns out of your head to solve a calculus riddle is math I don't like. But doing reductions of digital logic circuits using math algorithms was fun for me, and I did better some some people good a traditional math. Solving computer science homework/exam problems was hard for everybody, and I had my moments, but you have to picture in your head where you want to go, write it down in pictures, then you can conjure up the code to get there. Well, at least for me. Sometimes my code was called \"brute force\", but I didn't care, it worked and computers are large and fast these days. Sometimes you have to take \"poetic license\" with the requirements of the problem to solve it. I once had a class problem involving recursion. It said each iteration had to spawn the next using the previous values. The entire class literally had the method spin off another thread, until the computer cried out for mercy. I just sent the values of the output back home to the main, made junk collection destroyed the method and recovered the resources, and created a new one, with the saved values. Yeah, sound obvious to you now. :) The rest of the class thought I cheated. The professor gave me a strange look, and said it was OK, probably because I had the only working solution. Just solve the problem. That means first map out how to get from here to there. The coding actually becomes a bit relaxing until you reach compile time, and moment of truth.",

You should also make an effort to make sure your code is readable enough that if you needed to you could go back and figure it out again.

In this way, it is its own documentation; whenever you're unsure how your system would behave for a given set of inputs, your unit tests should clue you in, either through static analysis or by failing/succeeding.As you point out, having tests gives you a level of security knowing that new changes don't introduce unexpected behaviors.What you say with regards to losing your \"feel\" for the code, that can happen and arguably is a \"feature\" of having excellent test coverage and architecture. If you're soloing a project by yourself, you might not see the immediate benefit. But if you work on an incredibly complex code base with multiple contributors, it's actually a great thing for you not to just rely on your feel. In the \"real world\", imagine you're pulled off a project and someone else takes your place. This person will have no \"feel\" and will rely on test coverage to ensure they're not breaking anything.And finally, from my experience, relying on tests hasn't necessarily diminished my feel for the code. I still know what it does and where it does it, but I have the extra validation that I have the test coverage needed to make changes.",

        "body": "Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one). The best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project. The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit. Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound. We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else. The key is the input. What a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground). This is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code). The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***. A library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox. It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks. A good example of this in JS is JQuery. They are typically very specific uses and very tiny. You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine. SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer. A game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic. Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware. In general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them. They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic. Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer. You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)Frameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end \"the angular way\" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",

The feeling might even be mutual!1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests \"ordinary\" programming. Similarly, I find some languages like JS very hard to reason about because they're so … sloppy, and prefer rather strict languages; but there are plenty of people with the exact opposite preference. Finding out what _your_ preference is is also a key to feeling like you get it.",

I learnt enough to get myself through the door and the rest of it was learning on the job and solving real world problems with real world data. I think it’s great you are looking to be SQL certified but you shouldnt be worried if it has not “clicked” yet.Learn the basics like how to pull data, filter with WHERE, group by for aggregation and then move onto more advanced things like CTE’s , JOINs , window functions and i would say you are 90% there - atleast from an Analyst standpoint.Use this to try and solve problems, there are many websites where you can practice SQL problems with difficulty levels mentioned and if you are able to solve these I think you should consider yourself 90% there.",

To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.What's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.So, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?I'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)You could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).Then, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).CS50w covers some backend stuff.You could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.Of course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build. But that's kind of a big \"if\" (to find a project you'll be interested in that isn't impossibly difficult).Anyway, good luck. You'll have to sift through a lot of advice and decide what to do.",

Alone this displays that you do not lack the \"logical knack\". Who cares if the solution is not optimal at this early stage of learning.Take it as a lesson learnt: there are always several ways to address and solve a problem, and sometimes it helps to think in reverse (i.e. do the opposite of what is asked, as in your case).When learning, follow the old mantra:+ make it work+ make it pretty, readable, maintainable, modular+ make it fast - if you identify bottlenecks",

Can think of it as loop and replace each element with the result of f.filter -> perform boolean function on each element in the array only keeping those that match the predicate.reduce -> can be used in lots of different ways but commonly I use it as a map and a filter combined so I don't need to do .map and then .filter on the result but you can also use it to take an array to object or other complex data transformations that can't be done via other array functions.There are a bunch of other methods you can use in a library called lodash which you should learn if you can.Also I would recommend using typescript as it holds your hand and makes sure what you are programming is safe.",

It introduces you to all of the basic programming concepts like loops control flow variables while obscuring away explicit memory management or data types. It is also quite good at a lot of data processing work because of the intuitive way it handles lists so there is a big market for python devs. Once you get a decent understanding of programming concepts, then moving onto something like c or c++ may be a better idea because you won’t be fighting to develop a mental model of both high level and low level cs topics at the same time.",

        "body": "This sounds like an AI prompt, but whatever.First of all, I think there is a hidden contradiction in your question:>In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?>“What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”In the first question you asked what \"someone\" should do. In the second one you ask what a \"beginner\" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.If you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.If you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.If you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.If you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers. Since that wasn't your goal anyway, everything will work out fine.",

Still, there are jobs that prefer or demand Typescript knowledge, which is just strictly typed Javascript. That means learning about interfaces, generics and type literals, which is nowhere near as hard because I know most of that from Java. The idea I'm getting at is that knowledge of the concepts I learned in Java are helping me now, even though I never use Java. Now change the scenario and let's say I built projects with Java, but had to switch to C or C++. Then I'd be blindsided with memory management and pointers which take a long time to master, and time isn't on your side with so many bills to pay.Languages like Ocaml or Haskell are difficult to learn and I don't see many jobs for them. They are functional programming languages and most languages are OOP or procedural, so I think that these may be best saved for last or skipped entirely.",

I would go with him if I wanted to get my hands dirty with C code and learn by doing.Modern C is more careful and through. He spends a lot of time on theoretical considerations and the way you should view the language and the internals of how C works. A lot of time is spent on making sure you are thinking about C in the correct way. If I wanted a deep theoretical understanding of the language I would use this book. Note that Modern C demands more attention and time from you.Both are great books and regardless of whichever you read make sure to donate to the author to support them.

Spotify doesn't make it easy at all to download the audio, it's against their terms of service. And even if you had the audio, automatically determining the chord progression isn't simple or straightforward at all. There may be some advanced AI audio algorithms that try to do it, but I'd expect them to have errors.Honestly the most likely approach would be to fetch the playlist from Spotify, then search for online libraries of lyrics and chords, then try to analyze the chord progression from there. That would be complex but at least plausibly doable. I'm not aware of a centralized database with chord progressions for most songs, but there are plenty of places online that have them in nonstandard formats (often text). Then you'd have to parse various ways to write chords, transpose into the same key to normalize, and count how many are the \"same\".Even determining which is the \"same\" isn't easy. Do you count I, V, vi, IV the same as vi, IV, I, V? What about I, V7, vi, IV? There are lots of chord progressions that are very similar but not identical.",

I think if you're wanting to get into game development and robotics, you should definitely get into C++. With C++, you can get into Unreal Engine for making complex 3D games, or if you want to go more simple, you can look into libraries like Raylib which are compatible with C++.",

Tiny wins build momentum. Making it practical also helps — build small projects like a calculator or tic-tac-toe so you actually see your code doing something.Don’t compare yourself to peers; everyone learns at a different pace.

Speaking from experience, coding just for assignment and stuff will drain the life out of you and you'll come to hate it.

I went to a mid school, so I actually did not get taught programming the best, but by getting AI to teach me how to create things, I now have an app on the App Store (its called GradeGrind if your curious since it helps students succeed in university). I think AI will just reduce the number of jobs, but if you position yourself at the top, then it won't be a problem for you, and you may end up creating something that makes you more money than you would have made in a job anyway :) Good Luck!",

We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.It was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.After about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.After a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.After that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.That was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a \"solutions\" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.Two more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).A few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.If you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up. You can always teach yourself (as I did) but sometimes learning in a formal, structured setting has its benefits.",

Her experience in the other jobs do help and that is a big factor in any market.I didn't have any internship experience and worked for shares at a small startup after graduation.

How you present yourself matters. Even retail sales associate experience helped me land a job since I tied it to personal development.Try in your field first, it's a numbers game, then look for stuff like law clerk, sales and all. Get some experience, any experience, but tie it well. Coding was not bad in school and uni but trust me the requirements and competition is crazy for jobs.

Python only lead to me floundering for a while with not much feedback on how to get better.Its funny too when you talk about Haskell because in all cases it should be an obvious choice but you'll get people who have only done python for 10 years saying crazy myths. The point of software is to build something that works for a business or market problem, all these other languages sacrifice that correctness for being \"easy to learn\" while not admitting that most who learned that language stay stuck as a junior for a long time. So if you want to learn fast, you need fast feedback on what you are doing wrong, and so you want a language like Haskell thats gonna give you that fast feedback. Funny thing is, that once you get past these beginner exercises that you'll do in any language, its easy to move on to advanced haskell where you have 100s of features that dont exist at all in other languages",

For multiplayer, send the text to the server with a Server RPC on the PlayerController, validate length or profanity, then broadcast via the Gamestate or a Multicast so every client updates.To parse commands, check for a leading slash and split the string into a command and arguments, or enable the Regular Expressions plugin if you want pattern matching.Use a RichTextBlock with a DataTable to style names and system messages without custom code.Add simple rate limiting and escape markup so weird input cannot break the UI.If you need references, search for Unreal terms like UMG chat blueprint and replicated chat using PlayerController and GameState, which map directly to this setup hopefully",

See, websites are done with HTML, with the help of CSS to add aesthetics and JavaScript for making them dynamic. But there are frameworks done in Python that has to do with it.An example is Django. It enables you to easily make a web app with python. You make some HTML templates, and install some Database program. Django then runs a web server, which takes the templates you make and fills it with data from the database. It also reads user input and makes it into data that gets stored on the database. How all of that is done is what you do with Python on Django.But as the good ol' saying says: \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". Python **can** do pretty much anything, but that does not mean it is the best for everything. For example, if you want to do raw number crunching and high performance computing, Python is really slow, so languages like C or Fortran are more used in there.",

For instance, Docker containers are not much different than a hacky version of Solaris \"zones\" which existed in the early 2000s.

They may have \"skills\" that make them better suited for managerial or leadership roles. My manager says he has development experience, but he can't parse simple emails coming from Vendors informing us that they are changing their API tokens etc, and needs a dev to explain what is needed.People who are good at the technical stuff generally do not want the additional responsibilities, stress and the need to deal with other people that comes with being a manager. As an IC, my only interaction is with my team and with my manager, so around 6-7 people in total, and maybe 3 on an average day. My manager on the other hand, on average meets with 10 different people a day and maybe 25-30 people in total over a month. I never see myself as having the bandwidth to be able to tolerate that.In short, tech leadership requires a Goldilocks person who is both reasonably adept at the technical side of what they are managing, and has the managerial and leadership skills that are needed for the role. These people are likely rare and are already at highly compensated roles, and they enjoy what they are doing. That means the rest of the market has to make do with the average and below average candidates, many of whom are the aforementioned people who convert from technical roles to leadership.",

Whereas guys listing the jobs, set the parameters of how rigged it will be, then have to do a little \"extra work\" sorting through bullshit resumes then act surprised and pack a sad. I get it, job listers have leverage at the moment so they get to set the rules, but you can't be mad when you set bullshit standards and wonder why you're attracting bullshit candidates. In short, the reason why resumes are inflated is because job listings and expectations are inflated. \"YOU MUST BE A ROCKSTAR CANDIDATE WHO BREATHES PYTHON\" and then you get the actual job and have to beg your manager for a permit to even get a log in.",

Go onto LinkedIn, filter by recently added, apply to pretty much anything relevant with under 100 applicants. The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. 2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. 3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. \"Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%\"). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.4. If a job requires a cover letter, it usually has less candidates. It sucks, but it's usually worth it. Don't use AI, just write about how your skills that are relevant to the position helped you deliver results.",

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.Look at what you wrote:>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.This is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, \"why don't you just talk to him?\" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.You will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.You should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.So many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.The dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy. Others have done it before, you can follow examples/instructions, etc. Yes, there start to be complications if there are some specific requirements, etc, but you're trying to either overstate how difficult it is, or you're not experienced with it.",

Part of our job is to help stakeholders understand what they’re asking for. On a good day, you get to drive them towards a particular decision and make them think it was their idea.It sounds like you’re hoping that we, as a discipline, get recognized purely for performance on tasks that are hard to understand, and I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work.

And yes, the customer doesn't always know what it is they really want. They might think they want something but they really want something else. It is also the job of a software dev (at more senior levels) to guide those customers towards something better suited to what they are trying to accomplish.In short, coding is only part of the job. The higher up you go as a software dev, the less of it you do. As a lead dev, I mostly do requirements gathering, overall solution architecture, give status updates to directors and up and do code reviews for more junior developers. I also do mentoring and training of course. Any coding projects I have are those that I assigned to myself cause I either don't trust someone else to do or because I have some spare time to fill.",

You might be given vague specifications (\"do thing that make profit!\") alongside very precise and bullshit instructions as to how you should implement something (\"using latest AI models!\"). You might have a coworker or boss whose approval you rely upon who is toxic. There are countless examples where your autonomy is stripped and you are put in an impossible position and you are pointedly told to deal and STFU.Burnout isn't limited to just tech, but I think it's more common in tech than most professions to have a few decisions made above you to render pointless the entirety of your work output while the expectations to \"perform\" remain.",

The very real risk of layoffs without warning.4. Being constantly individually measured and tracked in an overwhelming number of ways (most of which are divorced from actual productivity).5. As a developer, spending less than 10% of my time actually developing (and instead wearing mostly Ops and BA hats because the employer doesn't want to actually have Ops engineers or BAs).6. The bureaucracy - Agile in name only, sprawling meetings, seemingly random change moratoriums, sudden drastic changes in policies, etc.7. No control over fixing any of it.How am I breaking out?

Here’s what I did:- neetcode 150 to stay fresh.- hellointerview for system design, watch enough videos until you can do them yourself. Set up job alerts at every company you are interested in. Then go to LinkedIn jobs, indeed, and GlassdoorJobs and set up alerts there as well. On LinkedIn you can search for most recent job postings. It defaults to 24 hours. You can manually change the number in the url to much lower, like 4 hours. The earliest applicants have a much higher chance of getting hired. I wouldn’t bother looking for remote, they are tough to get. Look for something in office or hybrid. And yeah unemployment asap. There is light at the end of the tunnel, it just takes a while sometimes. I sent out over 1000 resumes and only got 4 responses. Send out as many as you can. Reformat your resume to be ATS friendly and make sure to change the bullet points from “list of tasks” to include what the impact of your work was. “Increased speed of X by Y%”, stuff like that. Need measurable results on there. You can have ChatGPT massage your resume to match keywords for specific job descriptions, but lots of recruiters are savvy to this now, you don’t want to be a 100% match. Any more questions I’ll try to help. Good luck :)",

I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. I immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. Apply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. Reach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. Start applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. While applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. I used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. You’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. I was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. You also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. Lastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband. You got this!",

Reason being, your differentiating skills are going to be in things that are not as easily duplicated. An underrated feature of AI is the way that it's sort of locking in the current prevalent tech stacks, warts and all. But that also has the impact of putting a hard cap on what we can express well in these paradigms. My view is that differentiation will come through mastery of different topics, like logic programming, machine learning, etc. and knowing when/how to apply these intelligently. In the future, it doesn't matter much if you're a React developer or not. That's not where you'll find your value.",

A lot of those listings aren’t even real, and many of the “applications” are just auto-apply clicks. That’s basically spam, and these platforms aren’t great at filtering it. Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.Instead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills. Create a resume and cover letter tailored to each posting. Optimize for ATS and naturally include the right keywords from the job description, both the job title and the required skills, then apply.If you’re focused on remote roles around the world, check out a creative method in this Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).Mass-applying to thousands of jobs is just noise. In a pile of 1,000-plus applications in a couple of hours like the one here, I’d bet barely one or two actually meet the stated requirements. Be one of those.",

Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.No interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.I also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.Same for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.And yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.I'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine. Literally everything you brought up, I've experienced the opposite of. I have 12 YOE, so I've been around the block.",

So, if your employer uses a proprietary language or framework they can reject \"other candidates\" because they don't meet said requirements. The corollary also applies. A college friend took nearly ten years to get LCA (labor certification the old process) because he had about the most generic Unix and Ingres job possible, and a moron lawyer who wouldn't know an LCA if it apparated in his office...The system is screwed as long as loopholes like these remain open.",

See *use case* and *hack*.Another thing that happens is that specialized language can convey a higher status. I’ve found that when I speak in the plainest, simplest terms I can, I’m not seen as intelligent or expert as people who use highfalutin words, which confer an automatic degree of prestige.And I have interacted with middle managers who use specialized language and passive voice specifically in order to remove as much meaning as possible from their communication so they can’t be held accountable for anything. But they have to appear engaged and knowledgeable. I was working out the messaging in a public-facing piece of software, and the manager I was speaking with said “Oh, let’s use passive voice. Passive voice is good.” He didn’t want the public to be able to identify him as the source of a policy.I had a coworker once whose utterances were filled with a mix of corporate speak and technical terminology. I eventually realized that he had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, and he didn’t even realize it.

We haven't used it for years. But in documentation and informal conversation \"what's your LDAP?\" became synonymous with \"what is your username in our network?\" This persisted even after LDAP was deprecated. It's now been picked up on by people who have joined the company long after that deprecation. So you have non-technical people who have no clue what LDAP even is asking \"what's your LDAP\" when we haven't even used LDAP for like a decade and they joined a year ago.",

The current administration's desperation to lower interest rates shows they know somethin bad is about to happen, and they're firing anyone who threatens to break the dam by being honest about the numbers (e.g. the Labor Bureau head).So it's gonna get worse. It's going to get a lot worse... And then it will get better. But, there's signs this is going to be the big one. The president controlling the Federal reserve threatens to cause hyper inflation. Our debt to GDP ratio restricts our ability to print money and bail out failing companies. I think we're really going to struggle to spend our way out of this one, because foreign interests aren't buying our debt.So my advice is pay down debt. Save aggressively if you can. Maybe don't take out any big loans, and probably don't quit if you've got a job. Probably get out of that door dash habit, and tighten up your subscription services. Well bounce back, but I really think it's going to be a rough couple of years",

CS is kind of in a perfect storm environment. I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years. However, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. I don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience are going anywhere. I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc. The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto, Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.People talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,I also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs. I think any company that is relying on AI to be the drive for their innovation will probably fall behind in the long term.",

Only established people and the 10x devs will survive, and they will earn bigger paychecks than ever. Tech as a field will continue to grow, and there will be ways to profit immensely from it. However, simply being a decent developer in a certain tech stack is no longer sufficient to stand out. Sure, some people will get lucky and land good roles, but that's what it is: luck (but they will still delude themselves when they come on this sub and call it hard work).I like to compare it to the DBAs of the first dotcom bubble. Tons of companies had large in-house IT teams and DBAs who made good money. The rise of cloud services and MSPs made them less relevant. Obviously there are still jobs in that industry, but it is more competitive and less lucrative today. Only the best survived and the mediocre people moved on with their lives and found other fields.",

My experience is that most Juniors don’t know much coming out of college and that is ok. But, if they are passionate and approach things with the attitude of “I don’t know this but I can learn it” then they generally do pretty well. So, in the interview if you are interviewing with someone like me you get extra points for admitting you don’t know something and taking a stab at it if you have an idea or saying you can ramp up on it. If you follow up after the interview with a well researched answer as well as your thoughts it will make you a top candidate in my eval. Just don’t copy/paste someone else’s, this includes AI, answer. I need to see that you taught yourself something.Also on my teams I want people to be willing to ask the “dumb questions” they think everyone already knows.

There’s a sense that the best students get jobs through this process, and there must be something wrong with anyone “left over”. Like either they didn’t get a return offer from any internships or could not pass interviews. Anyone who did get through this process but is looking for a job with less than a year or two of experience is viewed skeptically as well. They’re viewed as not much more experienced than a new grad, but might have been fired or laid off because they can’t actually deliver. Intern pipeline is seen as less risky because you get 12 weeks to see how someone works. No, it’s not fair but it stresses the importance of getting a good internship that’s likely to result in a return offer.It also shows how going back to school for a masters can play to your advantage by putting you back into the intern university recruiting pipeline.",

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience? The answer to this question is \"get more experienced\".I say this as someone who entered the industry in my 40s, with no CS background, no college, no bootcamps, no professional contacts in the field. \"How do I get hiring managers to consider me?\" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me? And even if I have a disposition to consider more oddball candidates, given my background, there's still an ATS and a literal army of recruiter between me and our candidate pipeline, so I really never even get to see candidates who are oddball. Those are filtered out long before the candidate is talking to me.I'm interested to hear what other people here will say. I'm sure there are other ways to skin this cat. But the solution I settled on was to change my approach and expectations. I stopped applying for SWE and started applying to roles that were adjacent to, or had some plausible path to, where I wanted to be. I had zero impressive experience you could put on a resume, so I had to start far away, in (non-technical) customer support in my dream company. If you have some impressive experience but not impressive enough for a SWE role, you might consider something like Solutions Architect if you're more into operations, or some kind of Data Analyst role if you spike on the SQL/mathematical/statistical side.Find companies you think would be good to work for, and start looking through their open roles. Don't limit yourself to only the specific role you think you want next (and for which 100% of employers are ghosting you on).\\*Sure maybe once in a blue moon this happens for mostly unique or at least impractical reasons (\"candidate has 200k followers on Twitter and a strong social media brand as a SWE influencer\", \"candidate is a maintainer on some piece of OSS that is important to us\", etc), but by and large it's not a thing.\\*\\*\\*\\*Also my answer is calibrated specifically for your situation: breaking into the industry.

Those 80% give you workhorses that aren't exactly cash cows, but keep the business running. The folks who stay on long term tend to be high performers who carry onward business knowledge.It's no longer acceptable to just have an \"OK\" investment from the budgeting process. I've been involved in presenting proposed bodies of work all the way up to the CFO of a F500. Effectively, the view from executive management is that every project needs to be a home run out of the park in order to get approval in the current environment. That means you need to staff it with experienced people who already know the business domain, and can execute quickly without any hand holding - because the promised timelines to executives are aggressive. I've directly been told by middle management to \"accelerate\" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.That means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now. The only thing that will fix that are lowered interest rates, or you try to apply for companies which aren't cash strapped.

The candidate wasted time doing an assessment even though they gave a correct answer. They had no chance getting an interview because their resume failed. That isn't the interviewer's problem.If they read everyone's resume before giving the test, they're wasting time reading the resume of people who aren't going to attempt the test or who will fail the test.This is also why I now skip tests unless I think I can do it in an hour or less. Otherwise, it's just too much of a waste of time. Too many times, I did the test, gave an answer I was sure is correct, but no interview and no feedback.",

Big companies have UX teams that come up with different user experiences and test them with users. They also watch how people use existing interfaces, for example, to see where they are stuck or confused. Then they run A/B tests to see if there are improvements. For smaller companies, UX oftentimes falls on frontend developers and/or product owners. Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution. Then hand that off to engineering to actually build it. Engineering then demos it to UX and product to verify it’s what is expected.",

That is to say, good. Plenty of options and plenty of folks hiring. It's the remote roles that are seeing the most competition, for probably obvious reasons.I would guess that it's still somewhat more difficult to find junior roles, but he made it clear that in-person roles are the way to go if you're open to it and looking for a job quickly.",

I see so many posts on here about people struggling and they’re ONLY looking for remote jobs or jobs in their small/medium metro area where no large companies reside. Of course that’s going to be difficult. I had friends who held out for remote roles as their first CS job experience and many of them were unemployed for double or triple the time of those who were willing to move to a new city.

That's a minimum for like a small company, it only goes up from there. You are expensive and they don't owe you anything. The exchange _should_ be mutual, that's only fair.As someone who avoids giving people take-homes. We end up with a lot of obvious bad fit interviews and wasted time as a consequence.

This lead to a few outages and upper management (CIO included) wanting to kill my project, forcing me to justify *every single update* we make. On top of that, I'm fighting internal politics, favoritism, poor communication and coordination.

        "body": "You can go into different avenues in CS. I wasn't overly passionate about CS, but I liked doing web development, so I went into that, specifically the front-end. I know web development is a subfield of CS, but some jobs that deal with the web don't require you to go hardcore into actual coding. An example would be working with a PaaS like ServiceNow. You can code in ServiceNow, but it's not required, depending on your specific task. A lot of it can be configuration. Also, the ServiceNow market is hot right now, but much of the work is in consulting, which can be total ass most of the time.Just find an avenue you're remotely interested in and find jobs related to that. It's just a job to many people. You're not alone in this feeling. To kind of answer your question, the grass isn't always greener, especially if you can't find yourself doing a 9-5 regardless of the pay. Treat it as a job to fund what you actually want to do. This field is still one of the better fields to be in if you can get in, and if your located in the US.",

In the real world, there are customers waiting for solutions, lots of money on the line, code bases are much more complicated, there is terrible code everywhere, etc. School is theory and work is practical.I considered myself pretty passionate about coding as a student, but I was never the type to make projects on my spare time, be up to date with every new tech, or watch coding videos for fun. What interests me is problem solving, good design, and efficient solutions, whether it is abstract code or something in day to day life. These things keep me going in my career even what I'm working on is dull and boring. But all that being said, there is a book called \"Deep Work\" that stresses that you can be successful if you find the significance in whatever it is you're working on. It puts down the idea of working your \"dream job\" but rather finding meaning within the work you already have at hand, which is the mindset you seem to have is. That's a step in the right direction at least, as you are pretty deep in the CS path already.",

A career in Software Engineering is a never ending intense journey of learning and reinvention (most of the times for most of the people). If you don’t have true passion for it you’re basically putting yourself on the path to burn out. Some people are out in 5, others in 20. You may not think of it as a bad thing, you may think of it as a good thing even. But as a person who had to learn and pivot 4 times in the last 20 years, it gets really tiring really fast. The only thing that keeps a lot of people going is joy that you get writing code. If you don’t have such an obsession and want to have a career in this, you’re in for a really bad surprise.",

Consider a masters, it doesn’t have to be expensive, OMSCS is $7k and you could do it as slowly as taking 1 credit per semester.Get enrolled in OMSCS, take it slow and while taking the degree grind LC and build a portfolio. Being enrolled in the degree will let you access internships. And go up from there.Not saying you won’t be able to make it if you self learn but in this market that would be an uphill battle.",

Do you have friends in developer roles at your company, or even better, engineering managers? You gotta start making some if not. Pick up any projects you can that will get you working more closely with dev teams. Once you have a decent contact or 2 in engineering, just grab lunch with those persons and have a frank conversation with them that you’re looking to transition to development and ask what you would need to be able to demonstrate to get moved into a junior role.Having a level of rapport and trust with individuals making hiring decisions is 1000x more important for landing a role than a degree of experience.

This is the best reason for looking for a new job other than similar reasons (reorganization, merger, etc.).

Bad - family reasons. Really bad - pay, growth, “opportunities”. Remember the hiring manager wants you working for him as long as possible. The only 100% acceptable time to willingly quit is when it does not impact him anymore (ex. reorganization).",

A school like WGU or other online schools are under 5k a semester, which is pretty easy to swing if you don't have other obligations. Get in the habit of keeping your expenses low now while you have your first big job, and it'll make life a lot easier.If you intend to get it, try to get your degree before getting married and having a kid. :face_with_tears_of_joy: It gets a lot harder otherwise.If you want to chat and have another self taught contact, feel free to DM me.",

But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.By placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.As for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.Each one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.I can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.I'm sorry you are going through this. Hopefully you find yourself in a better job soon.ETA spelling out for the inexperienced that the boss from the job wouldn't be one to use as a reference if you waited out the PIP and got fired.",

There’s a higher ratio of customer support than software engineering. The happiest I’ve been is at jobs where my main responsibility is writing code. So, in my experience of moving from development to a more support focused role—this support role has easily been the worst job I’ve had. It’s contracting though—so there’s a lot of variety in my day to day: support and some development. If you can land a SWE job in this market, I think it’s definitely worth a shot.

To me the biggest difference seems to be actually caring and understanding the business use cases you are trying to solve. I work with a senior who joined a year ago but will probably be pipped soon. He can do his work autonomously, but he doesn’t actually think about the business and what we can do to improve, he is technically strong. He takes something from the roadmap and kind of drives the execution, but he puts no effort into understanding why we are trying to do something or how something can be improved. He has to ask us for basic business context, which shows he is only focussed on a solution, he doesn’t actually care about the teams goals. That to me is E4/mid level engineer behavior.Idc how well you code, if you aren’t putting effort or thought into actually driving the business forward, you are not a senior.",

        "body": "I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",

Stand up and practice in front of a mirror. When I was interviewing heavily, I got into auto-pilot for certain question types. When I took a break and returned, I was rusty. Have you actually gone back to revisit questions you've messed up? Or do you just ignore everything and then possibly repeat the same mistakes in another interview?",

        "body": "One thing that might help is practicing out loud explanations of your projects, almost like you’re teaching a friend who doesn’t know much about design or code. Instead of focusing on every technical detail, think of the story. What problem you were solving, why you chose certain design or tech decisions, and what the outcome was. Hiring managers often care more about how you think than whether you explain every technical term perfectly. Mock interviews, even with a friend or through platforms like Pramp, can also help you get more comfortable.Blanking out happens when your brain is overloaded. Try breaking things into simple, clear steps in your answers, and don’t be afraid to pause for a second to collect your thoughts. Interviewers usually don’t mind a short pause if it leads to a clearer answer. Over time, with practice, that blanking moment will happen less and less. Also, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of tips like this. Breaking into tech, career advice, and handling interviews. You might find it helpful for staying motivated and sharpening your approach.",

I can't speak much for ML, but I work in a team with over 50% of the engineers being MLEs. Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. There are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. Downside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. That being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29. All this is to say that its going to be hard to break in, but its definitely still a good way of life. If you got any more questions I can answer for you just go ahead and shoot!",

But from my experience, CS at UBC is pretty solid, and the program is renowned in Canada.I personally did a data science minor in addition to my CS degree, but you can also minor in statistics or math if you prefer to get some theory under your belt.TLDR: UBC isn't known for its ML curriculum, but the CS program is top-notch.",

If the work is satisfying to you and tickles your brain don't switch career paths to do something you don't enjoy, there's value in doing something you like. It's also difficult to find a career with this type of opportunity (even if you might struggle to find a job initially), you can work for a FAANG or F500 company without necessarily having to know the right people or live in the right place. Regarding your concern about actually finding a job, here's what I'll say:**You'll find a job**. If you're passionate and put in the work, you'll find a job.**Don't rely solely on your degree(s)**. Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. **Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn. If you're passionate about CS all of this won't feel like work and it will get you a job.",

Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.Recessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.The last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s. All of these things in the short term, but will go away at some point in the medium term.The last thing is that I live in New York and regularly attend UBC alumni events. The recent graduates I've met have it so much better than 10 or 12 years ago. The one thing is UBC is a lot more recognized in the states as a university today, especially among tier a corporate companies. It used to be the case that the main way UBC students succeeded in U.S market wasa via american grad school, because professors knew of UBC students. Now a days your seeing UBC students get jobs directly from undergraduate in Quant Firms, FAAANG and financial firms. THe one thing I will say is that almost everyone successful from UBC, leaves Vancouver.The other thing to get is tech is never going away as a field even if all the doom and gloom is correct. You are going to one of the best universities in the world and its academic brand is extremely strong. As long as you can keep your grades up, pretty much every graduate school is fair game for masters and paths to any university exist for Ph.D. (this is not always true). The reality of the world is there are MANY paths to success for someone who is determined, has some luck and siezes an oppurtunity. UBC is a place that you definitely can find a path.",

Put a 1-5 in every column. That way you always have a list of what to improve when you’re asked. The business is usually a lot more receptive than you’d expect to fixing tech debt.

Why the quotes around \"impressive\" and \"expected\"? Are those the measures that you think exist, or are they not?>I don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays.Well, then either, you are correct and everybody that does have a job is simply amazing - in which case: if you want to flip a burger right, it's all in the wrist action! Or you're full of shit and overly dramatic, and that's cool and all, but it will not actually help you to get a job.> If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in.Companies do not give out jobs due to the goodness of their hearts! News at eleven!>No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.You forgot \"pointless\", because the vast, vast majority f developers is not getting hired for their million dollar ideas. and I honestly have no idea what could possibly make you think otherwise.

While there might be a small world coincidence that you make a recipe app and a recipe/cooking company finds you, the tech you’re using and concepts you’re learning are more important than the business domain at this point. Want a general web dev job? Learn React, HTML, CSS. Fire are you getting data? Learn hire to build an API in the language and framework of your choice. The more popular and standard you are, the better your chances of finding a job. Whenever I see a resume that focuses on what was built vs what tools were used, I get sad. Making a monopoly clone isn’t the important part. But knowing how to build the different parts is. Working on game mods is great and can be supplemental information, but unless you’re trying to work for a gaming company or work with that tech, it’s not that helpful. Oh, you made node for World of Warcraft using Lua. That’s great, but we’re need someone who knows Python and has used Pandas. If you’re building “the next great thing,” you shouldn’t be working for some random company. But most of us won’t be building that next great thing. If you want a “normal” job, show some familiarity with the tools and concepts. It’ll make you a better candidate than the one building abstract school projects. PS - you can continue working in the next best thing in your spare time. There’s still a numbers game going on right now, but you want to get the numbers aligned with you as much as possible.",

If sending my resume out to places gets nowhere then the rational conclusion to draw is that the resume is not impressive to employers in any way. If hiring people aren't impressed by my projects than the only logical assumption to make is that the people being hired have significantly better projects in every way (more users, more profits, more relevance to each company).

Because something that isn't being used is - by definition - not a project. But that doesn't imply hundreds of thousands of users, nor does it imply \"profitable\".How do you judge a piece of software that you use? Do you give a fuck if the author was making a profit?

Again, they don't care about the project that much, unless it's relevant to their business. You're trying to learn more things to be relevant to the position. In some cases, it won't be enough to just know C#. In other cases it will. When you say using C# for endpoints, do you mean building out API endpoints? Sounds like you may have missed out on a position because you didn't know how to do that. Have you gone back and tried to learn, in case it comes up again? You might see certain patterns come up in interviews. What are companies looking for? Portfolios feel like they are from another time, although you might be able to get an interviewer to take a look during your interview. But the problem is they can't be sure if you actually built the thing yourself unless they ask you questions about it. If you're looking for an entry-level position, no one is expecting you to have created a big project on your own. They want to see what you know. But building a project is one way to learn these things. Look at your own reply. You got rejected because you didn't know how to use C# for endpoints (possibly just one factor). You say you know C#. What have you built with it? Is it something relevant and useful for a position, or is it something that would make sense for some other type of job? For your meal planner, what was the backend? How are you storing data? Those seem like logical questions I'd ask to get a better idea of someone's background during an interview. I interviewed someone coming out of school once. She didn't have a ton on her resume. She listed school projects. Once I started asking questions about the projects, she couldn't answer anything. Was it too long and she forgot? They were group projects, did someone else do all the work? She couldn't answer, so I wasn't really left with much. She started looking like someone that may have misrepresented stuff on their resume.",

That's just the number of unique IP addresses that used it for at least a few minutes, not necessarily the number of long-term users.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. The most common advice I've seen is \"aim for smaller companies and take a more personalized approach\" which is probably my best bet right now and what I'm currently trying.If nothing works out I might just have to switch industries or go to college, but that would be a real bummer and I'd like to avoid it if at all possible.",

If you frame it as “hey I can pick up this task but I’m currently working on X, is this higher priority?” He isn’t just offloading work, he’s now thinking about how this task is going to fit into the sprint.Another thing I started doing was to add “unplanned” tags to any task that was given to me mid sprint, so at the end when I’m questioned on why I didn’t finish everything I could point to the 5 unplanned tasks I got. Also it’s just good as a team to know how much unplanned tasks people are doing. These suggestions assume your manager is a somewhat reasonable person.

And apply to roles where there is a coding round so those skills can shine through>I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber insteadYes, that's called opportunity cost. It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.The way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviewsI don't think you're being a negativity spreader.

However, if you’re working alongside other Seniors and they’re not doing the level of team management you’re doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn’t have Leads, that’s a very different situation.There are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there’s what’s called a “Tech Lead Manager”, which is sort of in between the two – usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don’t do salary review, etc.One useful way to frame this is, “I’m enjoying the work I’m doing to lead (or ‘help lead’) the team, and I’d like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I’m doing the highest impact things?”Basically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine… and is often not fine for reasons that you don’t have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there’s something fundamental that you’re missing, you’re better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you’re not being promoted.Depending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",

The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of \"wasted\" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \\_only\\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. Coding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, \"beyond human\" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, \"code\" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. Basically it would look a lot like how ML \"brains\" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect. A beyond human program would work the same way, a black box that we just test until it does what we want it to do.",

        "body": ">\"more stable, affordable, maintainable, usable, scalable, extensible\"You used a few words in here that are strictly human concepts.A major part of our jobs as SWE is writing simple code that is easily read and understood by humans, which in turn makes it easily maintainable and extendable by other humans. That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And \"stability\" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.Unit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.\"better than human\" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.One example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a \"better than human\" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.Better than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. \"Difficult to extend\" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch. It doesn't *need* an elegant solution that doesn't need to be re-written with every little change.Your chess analogy isn't really that great here. All the elements of chess are inherent to the existence of chess. An AI is just learning to play the game. But a significant amount of the elements that make up *human* programming are not inherent to *programming*.",

Now if we make an offer we will stop putting new people in the pipeline but continue forward with the ones we have until someone accepts. At that point we shut it down and clear it.

Large tech companies especially love throwing CAP theorem, load balancing, and scaling questions at frontend candidates to see if you think beyond just the UI layer. That said, plenty of companies still focus purely on frontend-specific system design like state management, component architecture, performance optimization, and API integration patterns.Your experience with mostly frontend-focused interviews isn't unusual, but as you level up in your career, expect more full-stack system design questions to creep in. The good news is you don't need to be a backend expert - you just need to demonstrate you understand how frontend applications fit into larger distributed systems and can make informed decisions about caching strategies, data flow, and performance bottlenecks. The key is showing you can think holistically about user experience from both a technical and architectural perspective. I'm on the team that built [AI for interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this trend where frontend roles increasingly include broader system design discussions, so having a tool to work on these trickier cross-domain questions can really help you stand out when these curveballs come up.",

The reasoning is that even if the immediate role is largely frontend, we're not hiring \"react devs\", we're hiring software engineers who may need to pivot and pick up other stuff at some point.You don't need to name drop every concept under the sun, but given a set of requirements, you do need to choose the system components in a sensible and defensible way. What happens a lot is people name drop something somewhere that sounds like it might fit at a glance, but doesn't quite make sense in conjunction w/ everything else they added around it, I ask them a question about it, and they admit not knowing much about it, or worse they wing it, poking more and more holes into the design as they go.For example, we might be talking about performance, and then they add redis somewhere in the diagram, but it's in a suboptimal place, or they didn't think about cache invalidation or whatever, and then they start adding bandaid arrows and it just goes downhill from there.Another thing that a lot of candidates are surprisingly bad at is schema normalization, and that comes up quite a bit because data modeling is a sort of a \"checkbox\" topic.",

Do not skip that step. Start cold emailing recruiters via their email or LinkedIn with a genuine reason why you want to work at their company and why you’d be good for their job opening. Don’t use ChatGPT to write the email for you. Send your resume to them (don’t forget to curate it).Keep doing all these steps over and over until you get a job.

Each line takes less than a minute to add, and at the end, you'll be able to calculate your offer rate, then make a new sheet for the next job hunt.Google sheets is really the app to do this, even if you save a minute, or 30 seconds with some hypothetical app, if you spend more than an hour or two figuring this out and implementing something better, it's still a time waste.",
