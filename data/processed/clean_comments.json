And if something doesn't work and they have funds, there's also nothing wrong with pivoting. I don't even get this comment - do you have any experience in startups?> I just doubt all these execs in their 50s+ even know what Apache Airflow is.This is just moronic ageism.",

Airflow has operators, which are essentially wrappers for python code, API calls, etc to simplify (in theory!) the deployment process, make it more repeatable and reduce boiler plate code. Dagster is the same but it doesn't use Airflow operators. Instead they're using assets, sensors, etc. If you're new to it, I'd start with Dagster. Not so much for the orchestration side of things but rather the deployment. Airflow is a kubernetes first architecture and it's a ball ache to install and run locally if you don't know what you're doing.",

When I do, I try to remember a few things: a) Each company has its own preferred set of technologies AND you don't have to learn a new thing overnight to be valuable if your platform does expand. It's okay to trial.b) There is no \"right\" way, in that it's a moving target that depends heavily on context. There are certainly better ways, but you'll never have everything exactly as it \"should\" be. So, keep learning and don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough.c) Focus on filtering out the noise. Some new features or technologies will be useful, some won't. Identifying which ones are worth your time is a great value add.d) On the above, find an expert in the field that you trust and use info from them as a North Star. Don't take everything as gospel of course, but it'll at least give you some direction.",

Boom - you can upgrade and rollback your business logic by just changing which image to use in Airflow's web UI.At this point, Airflow is pure orchestration.

It worked well and it think can probably handle a lot more complexity than I tried with it. I’d imagine you could certainly run into limitations compared to a purely custom coded solution, but it’s nice. And when building your own you can give it the documentation and an AI tool tries to build it for you. Your mileage may vary and it didn’t really do what I wanted so I didn’t use it. The other great thing about it is that you can self host. I haven’t tried but the docs make it seems straightforward enough. Then it’s free (other than Infrastructure costs) and you don’t have the normal vendor lock in. But I’m using their hosted version because it’s easy and I’m not running enough data through it to be worth the hassle. The pricing on the hosted version seems reasonable.",

This should solve your API maintenance challenge.Your Airflow instance should only do one thing that is triggering dbt build job after Integrate completes the loads.

Add another column with priority (High, medium, low)Take the total estimated implementation time in hours (+/- 20%) and divide it by your total estimated working hours over the next month. That's how many connectors per hour you're required to finish this project. Is it 5 per hour? Is it 3 per hour? Whatever the answer, does it seem reasonable to accomplish knowing your skillset?Meet with the leadership with your spreadsheet, have them identify what is most important. Communicate a reasonable expectation of how many of these you think you'll get done in the next month given the information above.Edit: While the task does honestly seem like BS, this is a chance to get an insane amount of exposure and knowledge around the MS fabric ecosystem and data pipeline building. Document your accomplishments as there will likely be many. Use this opportunity to optimize as much of your workflow as possible and you can leverage into something much better than this. At your next interview you can describe how you were given what you thought was an impossible task and instead of running away from it, you consulted with other professionals regarding the best way to approach it, took away best practices, and implemented a plan to complete the job. Whether or not you're successful at this job, you at least did everything in your power to understand and complete the task.Good luck!",

Hubspot may have some slower streams which could significantly slow down the rest of the sync if they are the first to run. A general suggestion for API sources (especially when slow) is to deselect any streams that you don't need.In regards to the destination performance (BigQuery), we are starting to roll out our \"Direct Load\" (https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/using-airbyte/core-concepts/direct-load-tables) which may speed up BigQuery load performance up to 2-3x. That said, if the source connector is the real bottleneck, the BigQuery performance boost may not help as much in your scenario. With API-type sources, much of the performance constraint is often in the API itself, but without diving deeper, I can't say specifically if that is true in your case.I hope this info is helpful - and sorry you are seeing poor performance here. Let me know if any of the tips here help, and I or my colleagues will check back again to see if we can further assist.Cheers,AJUPDATE: BigQuery destination connector >=3.0 now supports \"Direct Load\", per changelog here: [https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#changelog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#changelog)",

You have to be the salesperson and gatekeeper for your team and not everyone is ok with that type of work.The job itself is only part of the decision, there’s always the opportunity cost to consider. What would you be doing if not for management? Applying for other jobs, learning a new technology, honing your craft? The more enticing the alternative the worse of a decision accepting a management path is.If it were me I would take it. I’ve done the Individual Contributor side for over 15 years now and I’m ready for a more strategic role. I’m good as an IC and I’ve held a team lead position in the past, but I swerved back to IC because I enjoyed having complete control over my own success.

        "body": "The key thing you should ask yourself: Do you \\_want\\_ to be a manager, or do you prefer working as an IC (individual contributor)?Managers are people people. You will reduce the time you spend doing the work (writing spark code or w/e your niche is) and you will increase the time you spend on meetings, \"people problems\", and company politics. Especially if your have a decently sized team (6+ direct reports) you can expect to spend about 0% of your day writing code and 100% of your day \"facilitating\". I'm phrasing this strongly not because I want to scare you away, but because I would like you to be aware of what you are walking into when you say yes. I chose to switch into the managerial track a while back and I must say I really enjoy it. If you have a tech background and can convince people of ideas you can really move the needle.That said, the \"cost\" is that you no longer get to play with any the cool toys yourself. You argue for better tech, fight for approvals, maybe participate in vendor negotiations, but once you get your hands on it you immediately give it to your engineers and they get to have all the fun. If you don't like the sound of that then maybe the managerial track is not (yet) for you :)Also, I had several conversations with people chasing manager positions because of salary. I wouldn't do that. You can get a VP-level paycheck as an architect or principal-level engineer if you are good. Heck, Tiktok Data/ML engineers can make up to $700k US a year so there is really no reason to become a manager just because you want a raise. Also, those people make shit managers (I worked underneath one for a few months).Final comment in the wall of text: Make sure that your promotion is not booting out your current manager. Replacing someone on parental leave will give you a bad rep and your rep will become much important than it is now.",

Management doesn’t want that risk since there’s no going back and can hurt your career if you aren’t ready.

Sometimes I would stumble on the answer I needed in the results or the actual link I was looking for somewhere buried in the comments 3 links in and apply it as needed. But for the past several years that's become less and less useful as (I assume) the [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) has trended more towards people treating search engines like people, so I've started needing to do the same. Now my questions are more like \"*How do I add X onto Y?\" + \"\"Z language\"\"*.Going to something like W3schools.com and looking through the functions by language/category and applying them to the situation at hand step-by-step until I get what I needed has always worked, though it's obviously more effort than a single result giving you a ready-made answer. So has watching videos related to the subject I'm trying to resolve.So.. I guess my advice is to change your search patterns to be more like natural language (and utilize [advanced search engine options like flags](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) to filter out bad results), look for \"beginner\" type sites to help narrow down your search criteria (or expand it if needed), and try to include keywords that will help you find examples.

As part of our CI/CD pipeline each data product registers itself using an Api Gateway endpoint so all services are fully autonomous and independent as far development goes (ofc thanks to dagster, the full lineage chart of source dependencies is easily accessible on ui). As for storage we use Iceberg tables on S3, and Athena as SQL engine.

My team used a strangler pattern for it and we did a lot of rinse and repeat. We refactored the codebase of our 20-ish pipelines to look the same (~7-8 jobs of different type in each, some PySpark, some map python tasks, some machine learning stuff) and converge on subset on technologies and only then did the rewrite. Lots of evals and verification as wellI found that having a flexible orchestration tool helps if you want to change technology or replace it with something else (let's say you want to replace Athena with Spark in the case of more modern tools it is easy to swap once you set it up once and it works with your orchestration), that is where we spent our innovation tokenAs for growing costs - a bit hard to say, but could it be that you can pre-compute some aggregations to not re-run some computations? Like calculate daily counts that get used to calculate monthly numbers?Also, when it comes to costs - can you look at your AWS account and try to understand what is the main driver of that increase?",

You can spend a ton of time trying things, but in the end, just keep things simple. Also, while many tools above are open source, don't fall into the trap of setting up everything yourself.

Airflow is nice but can carry a lot of infrastructure overhead. If you and your team are not interested in spending time on managing infrastructure, patching, etc. I would go for Prefect. We tried Airflow and it was way too time consuming to set it up and manage. Perfect was extremely simple and just worked. The underlying approach of the two is still the same.Go Databricks if you are looking to stay very close to your AWS account. Check out Snowflake on AWS in the same region your current AWS Org/Account if you're looking for greater flexibility in the future. Both are roughly the same cost.If you're analysts are well versed in SQL then Databricks or Snowflake are great solutions. If they are not SQL experts check out analytics platforms like Sigma that natively leverage the strengths of cloud data warehouses. We use Sigma and it's a great analytics tool first and foremost. It also does reporting and dashboarding.",

        "body": "Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks. I think they start their first cohort this semester.Feel free to ask any questions, I’m happy to answer where I can.",

My manager tends to hire type one as consultants and contractors that come and go. She hires type 2 as full time employees that stick around.

However, as you mentioned with DE not providing a solid cloud computing foundation, do you think it would be sufficient to add CS cloud computing electives.

You are placing your operational decisions in the context of business decisions.Fwiw, it’s not reasonable to expect an out of the box solution to outperform something bespoke. And your conversation is really about custom in-house versus a customisable off the shelf (often abbreviated COTS) solution. It’s not really meaningful to bring open or closed source into it- some of the slowest, crustiest, dogshit code on earth is very expensive and has a proprietary license attached. And if your thinking is ‘in-house = free’ like open source, you are very much mistaken. Honestly, not even open source is actually free, you just don’t need to pay for a license. We can’t really comment on your particular situation without knowing more about it. What code did you implement your custom solution in, for example? What is it actually doing? Is one solution parallelised whilst the other not? Where are your bottlenecks? In 2025, I’m very suspicious of any process that takes 5 actual minutes for less than a million or so rows, frankly. It suggests a configuration issue. But as a more general thing, software is like a pet- it needs to be fed, watered, and periodically taken to the vet. Eventually, you will need to deal with it humanely. If your org can support a development team to maintain your in house solution, good for you! It may be worth considering how well that dev team scales, what else they do, and what their long term prospects look like. Consider the time and salaries of those developers versus an off the shelf approach, for example. You seem to be operating under the illusion that your in house solution is free, when in actual fact their on-cost will be about 2-3x their salary. Your organisation will need to pay that, forever- or at least ass long as that software exists. And if someone gets laid off, do you have the redundancy, resilience, and skill overlap to maintain it?And yes, training new staff becomes an issue when you have custom software- ask any game dev studio why game engines are essential even though custom code is faster, for example. It’s an ongoing problem for businesses, and the bad news is that it looks like you’re thinking a bit like an architect.",

That's not really \"worth saving\" because your time will cost more.** If it was more, maybe it would be worth it - but this is the logic i would use to decide these things \\- now if you have some **hard requirement,** like data has to arrive by time X, or has to run faster than Z, that could be an issue and that's the moment you look into speeding it up. At this point you could try things like fast backends if you use sql, async, parallelism in dlt. If that doesn't solve the issue, you could write a custom job.

For extra information, this specific pipeline was a glorified select * into our table from a remote oracle db. In this specific case we just 1. Read source table into polars2. Compare with current schema3. Save it into a local parquet file for audits4. Load into SQL Server with csv dump -> bulk insert -> mergewith DLT I skipped the 3rd step, as it was a quick POC. I don't have the exact logs, it was a few weeks ago, but the dlt time distribution was:~10s extract~3,5m normalisation~1.5m insertWhich was weird, since we're reading relational data, and as far as I know normalisation is mostly relevant for nested data. Still, I've tried following dlt optimization instructions, but they didn't help sadly. Here I'd like to note that DLT setup docs for the different sources are top-tier. Even if we didn't end up using it, in a ton of cases we've used their pipeline guides as sources, they're more complete than their counterparts in many cases.Regarding your architect comment - yeah, I feel like I simply don't see all the cost factors, and these are actually quite hard to find. This was the main motivator for the question, currently it seems like I'm one of the main drivers of tech solutions / choices in my team, and I'd like to skip some painful realizations if possible :grinning_face: Regarding cost, you also have these hidden costs with COTS solutions as well, no?1. Integrating these solutions together is usually pretty hard, but the DE space might be better in this regards (AFAIK dagster + dlt + dbt works pretty nice together). Still you now have n systems to maintain, which can break in unexpected ways at the interaction points2. Lower development speed due to worse performance (this could be offset with way smaller dev datasets I guess)3a. You either lock versions -> have to self-code unimplemented functionality -> you have a frankenstein, and the same garden analogy applies3b. You keep up to date with updates -> migration costs on updates, hidden changes can break workflowsTo me, these costs seem to be on the same OOM over the long term. But again, I have too little experience to properly quantify them, so I'm basically talking out of my ass",

Which offers you to tie to various computes, should enable you to run a spark job on a defined rule set of transformation. Even if it was meant for Duckdb initially. (I could be wildly wrong here)As for designing tools. Earlier this year we were trying to design a schema that enabled data coming in from a variety of sources to be queries (pretty standard for a data warehouse). But 1. we had no tools to help with the design for this.2. make sure that the queries running on it would be efficient. The process was mostly just blind guessing and really subpar work honestly. But I was initially thinking of something that lets you visualize the attributes coming in from your sources at one end and the queries you'll need to execute on the other end. Which can help you shape your data in the warehouse maybe more optimally or atleast give you an idea of how well a query will run on the schema.",

When you do this, add two extra columns: start_date and end_date. Set the start_date to the day you ran the first scraping job (let's call it D), and set the end_date to something far in the future (like the year 9999) to indicate it's still \"active.\"Now, when you run your second scraping job (on day D+1), compare it to the data already in the table:* If a listing is new (wasn't in the first file): insert it as a new row, with start_date = D+1 and end_date = 9999.* If a listing no longer appears: update the existing row in the table to set its end_date = D. This marks it as no longer active.* If a listing is still there but has changed (e.g., price or details): treat it like a delete and reinsert. That means: Update the existing row's end_date = D, AND Insert a new row with the updated values, start_date = D+1, and end_date = 9999.If you already have a historical mass of scraped data, you keep going day by day until your current date. You then schedule your job to run right after the scraper to update the table with your new data.If this sounds confusing, look up Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) It’s a standard data warehousing method for tracking changes over time. The advantage is that you can use those columns you added to answer your questions.",

Then define a structure that aligns with your goals for analysis/downstream processing. It is usually good practice to not have transformation/normalisation and database update from the scraping process directly, although for small projects; do whatever ofc if reliability and reproducibility is not critical... For slowly (and sometimes platform dependent) changing IDs, you need an entity recognition process. There are multiple ways to achieve this, but you can often end up in a n^2 problem of comparisons. This is often dealt with using blocking keys ( think zip code, property categories etc), this way you get smaller n^2 problems. You can in addition/or involve embeddings or fuzzy matching logic approaches on top to determine duplicates / narrow comparisons. Best of luck and have fun",

The pains you are encountering are normal, and technology maturity has nothing to do with these.There are a few options depending on size of topic and frequency of user requests. If these are low, then I would suggest giving kSQL a try, I believe it is its initial purpose. Otherwise like another redditor said: writing a little spark tool, like a cli with a --sql option can work.But keep in mind this is going to deserialize potentially all messages in a topic at a time.So if this is too high workload for your laptops, then this is the signal to replicate the data to a system made for data exploration. Your parquet attempts with Kafka connect or Spark are good ones. So keep digging in that direction.The ignoring of tombstones is really strange, it's just a null value for a given key, it should propagate. Is it your experience or is this coming from documentation?Then for the Avro->Parquet with Spark attempt you should not have to use Arrow. Just go from reading the topic (and deserialization) straight to `write.options(...).parquet(...)` There might be some tweaking to allow for dynamic schemas depending on which topic you read, which folder you write to, and some tweaking in the frequency of that job to not write too-small-filesEdit: Additionally: for Avro to Json with Kafka Connect try and set `value.converter.decimal.format` to `numeric` there were a couple of issues like this with Json serde apparently:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-481%3A+SerDe+Improvements+for+Connect+Decimal+type+in+JSON",

Billing is an operational, transactional process. Don't give it to data scientists. That's kinda like asking a bricklayer to create architectural drawings for a new home. (Not a perfect analogy!)If you have other systems that do things that need to be billed, but none of them can do the billing and you don't have a proper system for billing, you need to fix that as part of your basic tech landscape. I'm surprised you don't have a finance/accounting system - they typically also handle billing.You need a person in your org who knows already how other orgs do this kind of thing, and can work out how to do it at your place. You could get a short term consultant in for this, if permanent hiring isn't an option.Once you have a decent \"destination\" system architecture planned out, you may need data people to help create the data integrations between those systems (if they don't talk natively or if the vendors can't help). Data scientists could potentially help with that, but it's not in any way a data science task. Python would be one language option for this, but not the only one. Fabric is not the right platform to build on, in any case, because ~~all~~ almost all of Fabric's data storage is intended for analytic purposes, not operational ones like this.",

Specifically, your existing process’ dependency on manually copying and pasting data around is something that no technology platform is going to offer an easy button solution for. If you really want to improve this, you need to first sit with your team and do the hard work of mapping out this process end-to-end. Then you need to identify all of the manual bottlenecks and find ways to aggressively stamp them out. Anywhere that you’re manually dropping off a file or copying and pasting data needs to be reimagined to get away from the dependency on someone manually loading or manipulating data. This will be difficult for you to do without some form of logic represented as code (eg Python, SQL). However, once you can do this, the technology can begin to help you orchestrate your code across your test and production environments. Turn the problem on its head: your position is that a software program is “overkill” for this invoicing solution. The CEO of your company would probably be alarmed to understand that the invoicing system is a rats nest of manual process and tribal knowledge. If this process is revenue-generating for the business, it’s worth taking the time to unwind the tribal knowledge and be able to represent this business logic as tested and validated code.",

Also, cost can get out of control with having too much of the logic inside Snowflake. Transformations will be harder to test and patch, debug, optimize, etc. Better, use Snowflake for what it does best which is storing data and querying data.If you just want do tests and DQ you could implement a tool that this job well, like Great Expectations.If you anticipate a growing amount of transformations and interdependent business logic, use a tool which is great at that, like dbt (which can also do unit and dq tests). Also dbt encourages documentation, which can be proagated to Snowflake if needed, and if your project is larger you will benefit from the lineage functionality in dbt.\"No logic in the database\" is a dogma I'm following for almost 2 decades and I have never regretted that.However, if you do not care about the cost, have a limited amount of transformations without too complex logic and rather prefer to have everything in one basket, go ahead.Snowflake & dbt can be a dream team, if you stick to good solution and modelling patterns and this combination is widely adopted.",

You are hitting most of the key pieces for a clean modern data stack.**On the architecture:** Snowpipes + dynamic tables is a good combo for simplicity. Just watch out for costs with dynamic tables if you have high refresh frequencies. The integer surrogate keys vs hash keys decision is smart, easier to manage and debug.**dbt thoughts:** Even with Snowflakes native lineage, dbt still brings value for testing, documentation, and standardized transformations. The macro system alone can save you tons of time. Plus if you ever need to migrate platforms, having your logic in dbt makes it way more portable.**Orchestration concerns:** You are right to be worried. Tasks + dynamic tables work for simple stuff but get messy fast with complex dependencies. At DataToBiz we have seen clients start there and end up needing Airflow or similar within 6 months. Consider budgeting for a proper orchestrator from the start, saves headaches later.**Random tip:** Since you are on three separate accounts, make sure your CI/CD handles cross account permissions properly. That's usually where people get tripped up.The biggest lesson from similar migrations is don't underestimate the orchestration piece. Everything else you can iterate on, but orchestration becomes the bottleneck if you get it wrong early.What's your timeline looking like for the POC? Sometimes it helps to start simple and add complexity incrementally.",

Pitch the idea of doing DE style work to your workload. Maybe putting heads together can give you a way to apply what you learned.",

The access control and governance piece is usually what I find to be missing from the DIY architectures that are posted here, but if this was wrapped up nicely as a deployable unit that could be dropped seamlessly into any AWS, Google, or Azure environment, it could be quite powerful for core data pipeline and interactive analysis workloads, even if missing some of the fancier bells and whistles in something like Databricks. Probably the biggest issue is that it relies on a team having sufficient knowledge of the stack components to maintain the underlying components in production, but this goes back to the packaging and deployment piece. How much of the stack has to be “always on” and how much of it can be spun up and down as needed? The more ephemeral it is, the better it stands as an open alternative. It has to be sufficiently cheaper than something like Databricks while not missing too much core functionality. Can live without Genie, but can’t live without centralized access control, lineage, and on-demand compute.You will also need some kind of interactive layer for this stack, whether it’s Jupyter, Sagemaker/colab, local IDE, etc. Maybe that goes without saying. Very interesting read. Thanks for sharing. I might try spinning this up.",

While EMR Jupyter supports PySpark directly, there are plenty of scenarios where SQL is sufficient for end users.Recently, there's growing interest in using Flink SQL for data lakehouse—and even so-called streamhouse—architectures. Until Flink SQL Gateway offers support for application cluster mode and stronger isolation, I believe Kyuubi remains a strong option for providing secure, multi-tenant SQL access to Flink.Besides, Kyuubi supports multiple compute engines beyond Flink, making it a versatile choice for enterprises adopting diverse data processing backends.",

But if you have a volume of data that can easily fit on your laptop, you shouldn't need any tools that can't run on your laptop.Keep it simple. If it's all relational data, you can use a local database. DuckDB, ClickHouse, and Firebolt Core all have native functions for reading from Parquet files you've pulled from IMF. You could even just use Postgres with [pg_parquet](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_parquet). Pick your favorite database, ingest the data into it with a `CTAS`, and if you're already using Metabase, it can connect to all of the above. Throw out the Parquet files once you've ingested the data.From there, use your database wisely. If you stick with DuckDB, create new schemas to separate datasets into logical chunks so you don't just have all your tables in one giant pile. If you need to transform data, you can just use SQL. If you need to do complicated transformations that you don't want to do with SQL, plug in dbt. Name your tables well. Use table and column comments to make sure you don't forget any important context.",

I.e. you run at a given point so many tasks in parallel that resources are maxxed out and don't clear quickly enough prior to scheduled tasks timing out. And you get into a cascade. Best process to debug this if you can be confident that functionally, your tasks work is to approach a production scenario from super simple testing. Run 10, 20, 30%... of your typical number of parallel tasks but just to a BashOperator echo. Scale percentage. Then move the executed task closer to prod settings and again, step up from 10% task load. Rinse and repeat, see where outages start to occur and as what % of total. You need to approach this systematically and only ever change 1 parameter in testing to be able to identify a root cause.EDIT: Otherwise check the operators you're using. For example, KubernetesPodOperator has a default start time out limit and that can easily be too short for your scenario.",

They have an abandoned Git repository with a few months worth of commits with only the commit message to explain what part of the package was changed.Deploying each of those SQL statements as a SQL Mesh model will automatically provide dependency and lineage data plus make version control and CI/CD more natural.I think...

To me it sounds like maybe you should extract specific standardized information from each pdf to a database and then you can use it to filter information, for example, using an llm to detect and classify project locations, sizes, cost at the time, and other related information, include source document and page, and for all location questions this should be used as a kind of index, I guess an llm reading each document and creating a json, you would need a validation for the structure of the output so it is consistent for all.The same for other subjects like names of people, locations (you can use a NER model like Stanza), tables, photos, designs, and so on, with this in place, maybe it is easier to identify which parts of each document has the information needed to answer a question and can be pdf raw fed to, for example, a Gemini query to answer the question or to simply used the gathered information in the database to answer. I am not sure that using pdfs and a chatbot is the best aproach for this though, seems to me that there should be a primary source of all that information and it should be collected and written in a database, and maybe some of these questions are some dashboards that should be built, but I don't have enough information of your context.",

When we modernized a steel plant, we started with a shadow pipeline that wrote to a separate lake while the legacy jobs kept running; operators got weekly side-by-side reports, so by the time we flipped the switch they already trusted the numbers. For live dashboards, push events from the line into an Event Hub, land them in Delta, then cache the viz layer (we use Power BI agg tables) so queries never hit production gear. Skip true sub-second unless quality or safety needs it; 5-min windows keep costs sane and still feel instant on the floor. We also set up a burn-down board of manual tasks and let each shift knock one off; that small win loop mattered more than any lunch-and-learn. I’ve run setups with Ignition SCADA for tag collection and Snowflake for fast JOINs, but DualEntry was the piece that finally let finance and ops share one source without nightly CSV fights.

We tried something similar where we let each department pick their first automation win, and yeah the momentum from those small victories was huge. Getting people invested in the process beats any technical solution.The Event Hub → Delta → cached viz layer setup makes total sense for manufacturing. We've been debating whether to go sub-second on some dashboards but you're right, 5-minute windows are usually plenty and way cheaper. Production systems already have enough to worry about without us hammering them with queries.Quick question - how did you handle the transition period when both systems were running? We're worried about data drift between legacy and new pipeline, especially with inventory reconciliation. Did you automate the comparison reports or was it more manual spot checking?Also curious about DualEntry, haven't heard of that one before. Is it specifically for manufacturing or more general ERP integration?The phased rollout thing is so true. We learned the hard way that operator buy-in matters way more than having the perfect architecture from day one. Sometimes you gotta earn the right to modernize their workflows.",

Data is extracted, some transform is applied (this could be minimal or significant; hence the ELT vs. ETL concept) and then the data is loaded to a data store. From there, the data is usually transformed again to answer questions, make visualizations, dashboards, etc.I think the best way you can answer your question is: Is the source data similar to raw data (ELT) or has it been transformed (ETL)?",

DMS is overkill when you don't need live replication, just periodic QA refreshes.Glue works well here since you have already got the catalog setup. PII obfuscation is perfect for Spark transformations, plus you can easily sample/subset during ETL.Few things to watch out for:* Make sure your obfuscation is consistent if needed (same customer = same fake name)* Subsetting can be tricky, keep referential integrity in mind, don't just grab random rows* Glue jobs can get pricey if you run them too often, but for periodic refreshes it's usually fineHonestly, if your dataset isn't huge you could also just do Lambda + RDS snapshot. Restore, obfuscate, point QA to new instance. Sometimes simpler wins.But yeah, stick with Glue if you want flexibility for complex transformations. Just test your obfuscation logic thoroughly. QA teams hate when referential integrity breaks or performance gets weird compared to prod.",

        "body": "Hello! I taught intro computer science at university level once upon a time.The feeling you are describing happens every semester with just about every student at one particular point in intro programming.So, you're not alone :check_mark_button:.In university, it's the point after we teach loops (for and while), arrays, iterating through arrays using loops, and even arrays of different types.Everyone is happy and everything is great... But then...Once we create a \"multi-dimensional array\", ie an array where each element is an array and write a nested loop to iterate through each array, no matter how smoothly I tried to guide students through it (which I always tried new things to build up to it and put significant effort into), just about everyone's' minds break and it's like they suddenly know nothing haha.Suddenly they can't even write if statements anymore. :man_facepalming:It was a problem I tried to solve so many times, but I couldn't.My theory of what happens is the following:A multi-dimensional array is effectively the first ever ACTUAL \"application\" or \"practical usage\" of computer science.Up to that point, students learn just raw mechanics (variables, conditions, loops, etc) but don't apply them to anything...It's never easy to leave the raw mechanics world and enter the world of applying your mechanics towards real-world problems.It's like your first time jumping off the high dive. It's always uncomfortable and challenging! And, that's okay!It's when you start to realize that simple logic can get complex quite quickly. Look at the code for binary search - it's extremely short yet profoundly powerful.My advice: Put your raw mechanical skills in your toolbox, stop focusing on them, and start using them.And, as always, give yourself grace and enjoy the process! :slightly_smiling_face:",

Pick one resource that teaches you fundamentals and then slowly introduces more complicated topics and then stick to this resource with maybe AI also explaining you concepts you might not understood in the resource. Do not use AI to solve your problems as you won't learn anything (even if you think you did). I had my biggest aha moments when my code didn't work and I spent sometimes hours debugging and understanding why things don't work. The more you struggle, the more you tell your brain this is important, so don't forget it when you eventually solve the problem. The struggle is an important part of the learning process.A resource I always recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project which focuses on web development but also teaches you problem solving. The projects are picked by the skill level you should have if you learned everything prior to the project which is great because then if you cannot do the project, you know that you need to go back and learn the topics which came prior to the project. The resource is open source and created by developers for beginners. You start with projects like Rock paper scissors and end with a full stack social network you need to develop yourself.",

That said, recursion is a neat way to develop algorithms to iterate graphs and trees. (You can also not use recursion, but it makes the algorithm more complex and unintuitive).

But I have some great connections in these community banks that will help us to approach them quickly at least in an entire city .Need guidance from some of the experienced people .The indian community bank market is growing, there is a very big market . We know the problems and issues they are facing and as those problems are modern we require modern solutions (and we have the solution)but most of the employees in this kind of bank are the retired corporate employees or either providing free community service after their occupational work and that's why they are trying to solve the issue with traditional ways or just trying to cop-up their work with the issue but they are not able to solve those issues completely .I can share my progress on the app , the issue , the solution everything.

This would teach me how to query an api for information, build a response, and then email that out. I'd also need to figure out how to host this script somewhere that can run automatically at defined times. So it's not a \"problem\" that's being solved, it's a task that I do manually that's repetitive and has a straightforward logical flow with defined inputs and outcomes. It's exactly the kind of thing that could be built into a small tool.So think about your day to day life and the kinds of little things you do daily, weekly, monthly that you could build into an automated task",

Don't be afraid to experiment. Play around. Break things. Fix them. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.+ Don't go looking for tutorials for everything. Learn to stand on your own feet. In that line, do a proper fundamentals course and then throw away the training wheels and start building.+ Don't give up too quickly. If you get stuck, go away. Take a break. Do something mundane, something with low brain activity. Go for a walk, go to the gym, take a shower, clean up, whatever. Then, often the answer comes by itself or if not, sleep over it.+ Don't use AI for anything other than explanations.+ Don't put a \"code first\" approach. Code is only the means to tell the computer what we want it to do. The steps before the code, the *algorithms*, the *steps by step solutions* to tasks are what really counts. Sit down with pencil and paper and go through the task. Analyze it. Break it down. Solve it *your* own way, as *you, the person* would do it. Track the steps. Then, once you have a working solution, think about how to *implement* the steps in code. Remember that you can't solve what you don't understand.+ Don't be afraid to ask questions. Yet, when asking, demonstrate your efforts in the line of \"I have researched *this*\", \"I have tried to understand *that* but am stuck at *this*\". Don't just ask \"How to do *this*\" as such questions will not be well received.+ Make the documentation of the language you are learning your best buddy. Make heavy use of it. Learn to work with it.+ Your other best buddy should be good old Dr. Google (or the search engine of your choice)+ Expect to be slow. Expect to run against obstacles. That's completely normal when learning. Only those who do not give up and conquer the obstacles (certain stubbornness is necessary here) can succeed.+ Do not look at how much you have to learn - it is a mountain that you cannot reach the summit. Look at the path, the steps ahead of you and walk one step after the other. This way, it becomes a lot more manageable and less disheartening.+ Be prepared for a lifetime of learning. You will never \"master\" anything. You will become *proficient* and you have to be satisfied with that.**Edit:** something more+ Adjust your approach to *failure*. Don't see it as something negative. It is completely normal to fail. See it as *gained experience*. You now know how not to do something. That is more than you knew before you tried it. It is equally important to know how not to do something as to know how to do something. I've added this point because way too many people despair, are frustrated, are destroyed as soon as they encounter failure and then, they instantly reconsider their choices or directly give up.",

Also, debugger can help you a lot with understanding how code flow works etc. Similarly, your IDE might make your life much easier, if you spend some time discovering its features\\- don't just fix effects of issues, but get to the bottom of them; a good programmer shouldn't just sweep issues under the rug (especially issues like regressions) but explains the root cause, so that it does not propagate further. It's a good practice overall and is good for professional development. Going back to previous point - learning how to use some non-obvious features of git, like blame, and integrating them into IDE, can make a world of difference while at it\\- keep your ego in check; there's much more to be said here, but this is an important one, especially around code reviews. There's two sides of that - one is don't take criticism of your work personally. It's very hard at first and might not be possible at all in some cases, but try to find a way to do it. Second - be kind when commenting others' code. You should point to the issues, but even you're 100% correct to point something out, do your best to use soft language and not make it inflammatory.

        "body": "> So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. It's a bit more nuanced, but lets say this is kind of true.In any case, at the lowest level that is worth talking about, it's possible to connect some wires to the CPU/microcontroller and directly influence the electricty. But usually people don't do that, because both the computer/environment and the programming part have multiple levels of abstraction.First: The computer has \"firmware\" built in, which is basically small existing software that is part of the hardware components. One of its features is also that, when you turn the computer on, it loads other software from some predefined place (ie. the 0/1, or rather 0-255, that are stored there), and continues with executing this - so that you don't need additional physical wires to control your computer. This other software, that is loaded, can be called operating system (OS). And the OS then also doesn't do \"everything\" with 0/1 directly, but can give some known commands to the firmware (that the firmware understands).This data that is the operating system, you could create the 0/1 manually. But again people don't really do this. There is \"assembly\", which is a very basic, hardware-dependent programming language. There are commands like eg. MOV and PHMINPOSUW, no convenient loops, classes or anything like that. A helper program called assembler translates such a program to the binary data that can be executed.And, for both manual-binary or assembled programs, there's also the question of the environment that it runs in. Should it be an operating system that works directly with the hardware/firmware? Or should it run \"within\" an existing operating system, where it doesn't get to access the hardware anymore, but can access things provided by the OS?As next level, languages like C/C++/COBOL/Rust/.... Here you get compilers that translate this programming language into assembly. These languages are less hardware-dependent, instead you get different compilers for different hardware platforms (producing assembly for their specific platform). Once again, it's important to decide if you want to make an OS, or a program to run on an existing OS like Windows or Linux. The code will be quite different. As you know C, you surely know things like printf - that's not something the hardware and assembly can do, it's part of an existing OS (and it's libraries). When writing C to make an OS, you have to make your own printf too, by using firmware things that allow you to contorl the screens output.ObjC etc. are not C, please don't confuse them.Next level are languages like Kotlin, as you expected. With Kotlin, Java, C# and so on, there is no compiler that directly produces assembly anymore. It's technically possible to create such a thing, but no one is doing it. Compiling to C code is possible too, but again unusual. Instead they have their own compiled program format, that is unrelated to what the hardware can understand. And in addition to the compiler, they need a second helper program (written in C etc.), that during each execution takes this custom binary format and each time \"translates\" it to real native things on the fly. It might sound weird, but there are advantages too (and disadvantages too).",

It was/is essentially the same as other higher-level languages we see today.Newer languages like Kotlin don't have other languages like C/C++ under the hood.

Sometimes you need to use an existing language like C/C++ to write the first compiler for a new language and then you can use that first compiler to compile a compiler written in the new language. This is known as bootstrapping.Keep in mind that some languages are ahead-of-time compiled directly to machine language.

When you have a problem, search for your answer on docs or stackoverflow/forums and find the answer yourself. You will learn so much more this way, and have a deeper understanding. Sometimes, if you don't know what to search, AI can be useful to help you put a name to your problem, and then you can search based on that. Knowledge is valuable. Don't offload your learning! \\- To form a deep understanding, there's no substitute for hours working on projects. Just keep doing it. If you find somebody you can team up with, even better! Maybe there's an open source project you can contribute to, or something you can start. Collaborating with others is a great way to keep things fun, and gain valuable feedback on your code.\\- Don't give up! Technology is a competitive field. But if you enjoy the work and are excited to do it, you will succeed. You just have to care and try. You'll get there!If you need feedback on projects, ask.

Even if it takes you two hours to get one small thing to work, that is a victory. Small steps each day begin to build momentum into big progress. Learn from tutorials, but don’t get stuck watching videos - get out there and actually create something yourself that you care about - you will learn a lot in the process. Good luck!",

So everyone starts at a couple different start lines compared to their peers and have no way of comparing their progress with their peers because of itTo make it worse, too many professors assume anyone that fails an intro class \"just didn't have the programmer gene\" and write them off, which i consider incompetent teaching Everyone can be taught the basics and helped to practice the prerequisites, it just takes time. It will be harder for some than others, largely due to just starting with different skillsets Logic, the ability to abstract rule sets, the ability to concretize abstract rules into an example, the ability to strictly read or write rules, being able to hold certain amounts and types of data in one's working brain memory at once which breaks down into both being able to chunk data and also some natural mental skill higher on the scale of the magical number 7 plus or minus 2 etc etc etc it goes on and onSo yes you might be lacking, but you can also catch up, I've seen it literally hundreds of times",

I make a guess, computer makes a guess, then it’s scored. Ok so how do I make a guess? I need to enter a value. I need to store that value. There’s probably some console readline function and I can assign that to a variableHow does a computer guess?Well we know we have to store the guess in the variable. And there’s 3 choices. So let’s assign each to a number. Generate a number between 1 and 3. And then say if 1 it’s rock, if 2 paper etcAnd then how do we score it?Well it’s all if statements right? So that’s some basic Boolean logic. If player= rock and computer = rock print drawIf player =rock and computer = paper print loseEtcAnd then you have a basic working game and start to tidy and optimise. It’s less about can I think like a programmer and more can I break problems down to their smallest components",

        "body": "As someone who learns foreign languages as a hobby, programming languages aren't very similar at all, and learning to program is not like learning to speak another language. I don't say this just to be contrarian, but because this comparison leads to what I think is actually quite bad advice right here in this post. With spoken languages, yes, focusing on precision is a bad idea because they're usually vast, highly contextual, meaning is frequently ambiguous and it can be achieved through other means. For example, in a great many languages a question can be achieved either through the structure of a sentence. \"Am I going\" vs \"I am going\" but it can also be achieved through tone. \"I am going.\" vs \"I am going?\". We talk in language learning about something called tolerance for ambiguity, learning to accept speaking and listening without fully understanding everything, because the scale of what you need learn is vast and you're trying to actively fire up a part of your brain that will start working on what currently sounds like gibberish and start building meaning out of it. Programming *isn't like this* and, I think, one of the major mistakes learners make is thinking it is, or should be. You are correct that in programming you don't need to know everything, or understand everything. Limiting your toolset is, in fact, a strength, but you do actually have to know the pieces you're using well enough to put each after the other in a purposeful way because there is no other party trying to infer your meaning in good faith. There is only the ruthless obedience of the computer.",

        "body": "Just a bit of a historic tangent note: Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's I only encountered the usage of \"unusual\" characters in passwords that were accessible by keyboard on one computer: The Apple ][e computer! Its OS and built in version of Basic allowed you to press CTRL characters as part of your password. --------------------------------So for example, you could type a password like: monkey123or you could type: m[CTRL-O]nkey12[CTRL-3]Both were completely different passwords. The cool thing about the Apple at that time, was that when you pressed the ctrl character as part of your password, it would do 2 things: first it would register that as an actual character of your password, and then it would next, do the function of the special control character. So if your password had the letter \"g\" and you replaced it with [CTRL-G], well first it would record CTRL-G as a keystroke as part of the password and insert that into the input. But then it would do the function of the CTRL character like ring the speaker bell, or whatever. It was quite a fun and unsual way of handling keyboard input that I don't think I ever seen since. I liked it! --------------------------------ALSO: On the IBM PC at that time, in theory there was nothing really stopping you from doing the same thing... So for example with an extended ASCII character set of 256 characters, including ctrl characters and graphics characters... You could use almost any of it for your password. But... the trouble was the way the keyboard talked to the OS MS-DOS and the BIOS, which was not the same as the way the Apple ][e would handle it. So if you pressed a CTRL character, for example, then the computer would just do the function of that ctrl character, such as ring the bell when you pressed CTRL-G, but not pass that on as an actual input character to the running program. And then as far as special graphics characters go, well the IBM keyboard had no way for you to directly type them, unlike the Commodore 64 for example, in which many of the graphics characters were displayed on the side of the keys, and could be typed with a special function key. --------------------------------Also interestingly: On the IBM PC running MS DOS back then, you could even use graphic characters in filenames which suprisingly as a kid experimenting, I found that out on my own! (None of my other computer geek friends had ever tried that, which surprised them when I showed them.) This would actually add some limited security via obscurity, helping make it a bit harder for people to poke around with your files on a floppy disk, because they could not just simply or directly open or run them by keyboard. --------------------------------ESSENTIALLY: In order to access a file back then with special graphics characters on the IBM, you'd have to write a batch file or Basic program to specifically address those unusual characters. Otherwise again there was no way to type those characters on the keyboard to do what you wanted with it. You could however still copy the files all you want using the command: copy a:*.* b: That would copy them from floppy drive a to b. So it wouldn't give you any copy protection, but still even on the next disk, you had the problem of getting to the files with a keyboard alone. --------------------------------Funny enough: All this to say is that I did use it to build in a somewhat half copy protection security and self-destruct feature! So ya: I was working on my \"big program\" at the time. It was a clone of Macpaint but on the IBM PC. I was using Basic and Assembly language. (It did some of the basic stuff of Macpaint, and visually it looked good! And you could move a pointer around with a mouse or arrow keys.) And so I didn't want my friends to \"steal\" the code (lol! As if they would!) when I gave them a copy to try on their computer. --------------------------------THUS: What I did was make all the files with special graphics characters only, except for the file which you could type to run the program. Next, one of the weird graphics character files was actually a pure text data file that just simply had a single integer. A run counter. So each time you ran the program it would just update the counter, from say, 0 to 1. And then the second time you ran it, it would update to 2, etc... When the program ran, it would check and see how many times you ran it. And if you exceeded the limit I put, it would then perform an \"Erase *.*\" on the floppy disk, and then next start a full reformat of the disk, LOL! My friends quickly noticed, and were like something to the effect of: \"Nicely played! Nicely played!\"",

I don't think anyone has gone farther than that.They're not reading the code. 99% of the time they couldn't even read the code if they tried and 100% of the time they don't care enough to try. Just put it on your GitHub, pin the project to the front of your GitHub, put a link to it on your resume, and give it a good README.md file with a table of contents and screenshots in it. They won't look farther than that. You'd be lucky if they just skimmed the README.md file on the front of your GitHub project. Note that you can only pin 6 projects to the front of your GitHub so don't go over 6 and try to make your 6 as good as you can (or at least make them look good).",

Also, quite often more code will deal with scenarios that are not the actual, desired operation and its steps (often called happy path), but everything that can go wrong in the process or when optimistic assumptions are not met.However, not to sway anyone with this - a lot of recurring complexity is abstracted either within the language itself (or its more advanced components) or with libraries. It may not be as good or straightforward as you might expect, but with some proper tool selection and experience, it's not nearly as bad as you might worry it is.",

I'm a complete beginner myself and cannot stress how much AI has helped me in my journey. I never ask it for the code. I always write the pseudocode first and then implement it via coding myself. Only if after a couple of hours of my own effort if I'm still not able to get it right then I ask AI to just nudge me towards the right solution and then I try using those hints. And if I'm still not able to do it then I ask it for the logic. AI is just a tool. Not bad or good inherently. Depends how we use it. You never delegate thinking as a function to AI. You use it as a guiding light. A weapon to be wielded.I use AI to get all my questions answered. Every single doubt that arises in my mind I ask it. This ensures I have no gaps in my understanding and I don't have to rely on external help, which might not be available when I need it.",

I write a lot of design docs before I start on large scale work, and reviewers find issues with my initial designs all the time too. It’s the same thing either way: people working together are more capable than people working alone. Everyone brings their own perspectives and skill sets, and this means that different people will see different places for improvement. This is a major reason why reviews are so important.Having issues highlighted is not a failure. It’s the natural result of being on a healthy team. If you see reviews as a chance to see things from a second perspective then it stops feeling like a bad thing. (Unless the reviewers are just assholes)",

Connect it to a database. See if it still works with your simple console. Now that you got a database you might want fancier UI. Start adding tkinter or even more advanced modern UI to display your recipes.Do incremental updates little by little and you’ll have a whole code base for your project.Now where do you learn all of this?

I.e. the activity of writing, debugging, testing the source code became \"coding\". As a shorthand of \"source code\" a lot of people just call it \"the code\" as well. Technically, though, all of the code is code, including the \"binary code\" understood by your computer's CPU or GPU.I grew up in the 1980s and people always said \"programming\" to my recollection from 1980 until 2000. I don't think I heard people talking about \"coding\" until 2005 or thereafter.There are some colloquialisms and vocabulary that only work with the word \"code\". For example, we often say as programmers \"let me code this up\" meaning something like \"let me write a quick and dirty program for this\", or \"code autocomplete\" which means \"let the computer predict the next likely thing that you want to write\".",

Compare it to learning anything else, like playing an instrument or cooking or speaking a foreign language. If you're interested and dedicated, you can learn a lot on your own.>I have the intention to go into web design and cyber security. Those are rather different fields. They both involve using and sometimes writing software, but there's a lot of specialized knowledge in each, and not all that much shared between them.>Am I on the right track ?I'd suggest doing more research into both fields and then picking one to focus on.Also, if you're really starting from no knowledge, the road may be longer than you realize. If you enjoy it, that might not matter; who cares how long it takes if you're having fun? If you're looking to train for a new career, though, know that the job market in the tech sector is not great right now and there's no obvious end in sight, and you'll be at a disadvantage compared to people who have more formal education.",

If not you should have firm grasp on just the general formal logic... boolean algebra and some really basic graph theory is also really helpful. And some stuff from analysis, linear algebra and trig might also help.- Do you know what is an algorithm? and I mean rigorously, not just a hunch. you need to be able to atleast surface level analyze them to explain them.- Do you know how digital electronics operate? You need just some surface level stuff, but again lot of stuff is basically impossible to explain without at-least a bit of understanding.I would recomend you read some books about the topic, my recomendations are:- \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\" by Niklaus Wirth- \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" by H. Abelson, G. J. Sussman and J. Sussman.You don't have to read them whole (tho I recommned you do), but atleast the first halves or so of each.Going through the MIT CS101 MOOC might be worth it as well...Then you have to pick a language/enviroment and just try to teach them these concepts in it...The interesting options there are:- Scratch - Some people think it's great, I think it's difficult to teach some fundamental stuff in it and I think grade 8 student might have already outgrown it... Plus 14 year old me would probably think it's the lamest think ever- Flowgorithm - similar to scratch, better at teaching some fundamentals, but more tedious for the students- Lua - Lua is imo extremely underated as a teaching language, it's way more powerfull than the above, actually usable in the real world, plus you have a great resource in the \"Lua Reference Manual\" by Roberto Ierusalimschy, you can then throw a in library like LÖVE into the mix and have a great fun enviroment to teach in.- Pascal - Pascal is also awesome teaching language, maybe not suitable in your case, but once again way more practical, makes it very easy to teach more advanced concepts, and \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\" uses it for it's examples. Lazarus is really nice modern enviroment to learn pascal in, and once again gives the student way more real world applicable knowledge then something like Scratch.- Racket - again great teaching language, you might find it easier to teach if you are particularly mathematically inclined.- Python - it is an option, I don't particurarly like it as a teaching language, but there are some great books and is actually very practical in the real world.",

Here’s my take:Java - if you want that corporate bag :money_bag: - Enterprise companies LOVE Java (banks, insurance, big tech) - Spring Boot is everywhere in backend roles - Salaries tend to be higher for Java devs in my experience - More structured, forces you to learn good practices early - Job security is insane - legacy systems aren’t going anywherePython - if you want flexibility and faster learning curve - Easier to pick up, more beginner-friendly syntax - Django/FastAPI are solid for backend - Great for startups and data-heavy companies - Opens doors to ML/AI if you wanna pivot later - More “fun” to work with imoReal talk though - market demand wise, Java probably has a slight edge for pure backend roles, especially for freshers. Most companies have existing Java codebases and need people to maintain them.But honestly? Pick whichever one doesn’t make you want to cry while coding. I’ve seen people succeed with both. The fundamentals (databases, APIs, system design) matter more than the language.If you’re really torn, learn Java first (it’ll make you a better programmer overall), then pick up Python later. It’s way easier to go Java → Python than the other way around.Also protip: whatever you choose, get really good at ONE framework. Don’t try to learn everything at once - you’ll just confuse yourself.Good luck with placements! :crossed_fingers:",

There's a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to make something tangible. Hopefully that's something you enjoy, but just be prepared!Yes, iOS and Android are separate development platforms (outside of some platforms like Flutter), and will require different approaches and, in most cases, development teams. A website would likely be easier but if you're building anything more than some text and a couple of images there's going to be a lot of learning involved.Check out the subreddit FAQs to find a place to start.",

Then you'll need to learn Android, which is the framework used to build Android apps. You would use Android Studio as your IDE.If you want to deploy on both iOS and Android, you have a few options:1. Learn Swift, SwiftUI/UIKit, Kotlin, and Android. Build two separate apps, one for iOS and one for Android.2. Learn JavaScript (language) and React Native (framework) and build one app that will run on both iOS and Android.3. Learn Dart (language) and Flutter (framework) and build one app that will run on both iOS and Android.Native apps (meaning, not React Native or Flutter) are almost always better in terms of appearance and performance, but many popular apps use React Native or Flutter, so they're not bad options.If you go with option #2 and learn JavaScript, you will also have a head start on web development (building websites), so it's not a bad idea for a beginner.Either way, you'll have a lot to learn. How you learn is up to you. Most beginners would probably benefit from first learning the language using a college textbook, and then buying a book that walks you through making an entire iOS, Android, React Native, or Flutter app, so you have guidance and a working example to build off of.

The options there aren't endless, but they all take consideration. The big players like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure come with advantages, like easy scaling if your app grows, but they may be too complex. There are many smaller players that may be enough for your use case too.You have to consider how you store data, what your users are and how login works.And then you have to learn to code.Don't get me wrong, I hope you go for it!

If it is a straightforward but not dead simple app that needs to work well, you need to start at the beginning, build up fundamentals, and get yourself to the point of knowing what you need to know even. Start with a intro computer science course - there are lots available online for free, like Harvard's CS50. Once you've got a few hundred hours of learning the basics down, then you can start asking some more app development specific questions. Expect to spend thousands of hours learning before you can make something decent. 3. If the app isn't dead simple and you don't have thousands of hours to learn app development, hire someone.",

You may occasionally need to deal with high school level maths like trigonometry or basic statistics, but if you're using a high level language, a lot of the maths is abstracted through packages etc.Lack of mathematical proficiency might put you at a *slight* disadvantage, but unless you're doing a CS degree, where they often tackle things from a mathematical perspective, you should be absolutely fine. The hardest aspect of learning how to code is learning to think like a programmer. And in my opinion, that's not really maths - it's more just general problem-solving, and not too dissimilar to learning how to construct different types of essays.",

        "body": "Whoa there's a lot to be said here. But I'm in a somewhat similar situation at the moment and quite burned out, so I'll try to cover all the important stuff:1. Whatever you want to do (career change, learn new stuff, etc), ensure you have a way to sustain yourself. In this case, \"sustain yourself\" could mean leaving your current job and living off savings for a while... Enumerate your options and pick any option that works for you. There may be multiple correct answers and multiple wrong answers1. Using one extreme case as an example: let's suppose you choose to stay at your current job and try to learn new things in parallel (this is more or less your current situation). Realize that your bandwidth is limited and the more burned out you are, the faster you will subsequently burn out if you don't let up on the pressure. 1. Learning while on the job: if you are able to draw a connection between your current job and programming, you might be able to pitch it as a professional development exercise to gain employer support1. I recently read [an article about Amazon employees reading 1-4h every day][amazon-reading]. Maybe there's something to it and your daily reading could be programming1. Learning programming is less about reading and more about fiddling/tinkering. At least for me, the learning correlated more with practice than reading earlier on. Later in my practice, I was able to learn more from reading than I was previously able to, but tinkering (trying out new ideas that I've read about) has always been part of my learning loop.1. it sounds like consistently finding bandwidth is an issue. Consider that your learning journey could be slow and bursty. So read about a small topic today and practice it for 10min. Practice it again tomorrow for 10min. Maybe you'll have more bandwidth day after, so practice it for 25min. The following week, start the next topic. In this example, I mean \"topic\" to be something as simple/small/atomic as list slicing. Adopting this strategy will keep you within your available bandwidth (and thus avoid/mitigate burnout), but it is slower than (for example) a bootcamp or a structured course.1. Eventually (on like a long weekend or something), try building a side project. Once you start down this path, two things happen: (1) you'll start trying to apply all new concepts to your project and (2) your project becomes your guiding light for what to learn next. This second thing is a super powerful driving force in helping you learn new and useful things.1. Remember always to listen to your burnout meter. You can't learn if you're burned out. It's counterintuitive and difficult to implement, but if you're feeling the early stages of burnout, STOP. Write out your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of paper... or record yourself on TikTok; find a way to externalizing your ideas so that you're not constantly ruminating over them when your brain is asking for a break (I used a notebook and a pen... I guess I'm old school like that).I'll stop for now (my brain needs a break), but feel free to ask followup questions and I'll be happy to answer to the best of my ability[amazon-reading]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/former-amazon-principal-engineer-says-he-spent-1-4-hours-reading-daily-and-it-s-part-of-the-company-s-secret-sauce/ar-AA1Iw4QO",

How you do algorithms, how you solve problems, how to be efficient, how to have a clean structure and style. After you learned with your first language you can jump into most other language pretty fast. I started with C++ and when I had to use Phython I read the documentation and boom. You really only need to learn programming once, the languages are just a tool and you switch tools for different purposes.That doesn't mean you shouldn't specialize. All languages have their own merrits but the thinking you have to do while writing stays the same. Specializing is something you should think about after learning your first few languages.And honestly with languages like Python there is not much to specialize in. But others like C++ people who are really specialized to that specific language are very valuable to some companies. But we are talking about really expert level technical knowledge of a very complicated language. It is dry and the work isn't very interesting, at least for me.My starting recommendations are:- C++I started with this one so I am biased and you need to know that you probably won't ever fully grasp everything about this language. It can do everything, it is used for everything, C is the backbone of programming. If you are good at C++ thats a real thing to be proud of and from there on you will tackle every other language. Still very hard and frustrating to learn. Some even start with C and I think thats also a really good starting point. C doesn't offer the same quality of life stuff that C++ does but that just means that tackling the hurdles that language presents really teaches you that \"logic\" that I talked about earlier. Tho I'm not sure how much that will help in real-life since you will most likely use a more user friendly language anyway. I'd say C++ offers almost the same experience while beeing way more beginner friendly.- Python If you have trouble with C++ (wich is totally fine, as I said C++ is a real challenge) Python is amazing. It is fast to learn, it is convenient and most of all Python is really really fun to start with and that is super important while learning. For real don't torture yourself with C++ too much, just switch to Python and try C++ later!2. What branch?Honestly just try out a few different things. Maybe there are projects you really want do do yourself. You could get into web development and create a cool website. You could try something simple like making Minecraft Server plugins and hosting a server.",

Immediately disable those secrets so they provide no access to any of your services.For the people who believe GitHub trains on your private repositories:GitHub's [privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement?utm_source=chatgpt.com#private-repositories-github-access) explicitly says:> If your GitHub account has private repositories, you control the access to that information. GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:> - security purposes> - automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service> - to assist the repository owner with a support matter> - to maintain the integrity of the Services, or> - to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.> GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.And there's no mention anywhere else in the privacy statement about them training Copilot on your private repositories. So unless you believe one of the most valuable companies in the world (Microsoft) is outright lying in their privacy statement, then you can not worry about this possibility.Legal policies can't play games like assuming everyone knows Copilot training on private data is part of \"the integrity of the Services\" - they have to be explicit.If you think they are outright lying or twisting words, then I guess you should immediately stop using any Microsoft products, and consider any information you've ever entered to be public.Similarly, GitHub once mentioned that \"no human eyes\" will ever see the code from your private repositories. A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games. Your private repositories are reviewed by some kind of machine, because that's how GitHub indexes your repositories for you! That way you can search for keywords and symbols, and so on. How else would they do that?Ultimately: your code isn't worth the risk to Microsoft. There are already hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of public repositories for them to use.",

This really doesn't mean much for a desktop but for an embedded environment this can be very important.Additionally when you run a program the contents of the executable is loaded into memory. If you are running two GNU programs at the same time then each has to be loaded in to RAM. With the BusyBox single program only 1 copy is loaded into memory and both programs can use the same code, thus reducing memory usage. Again great for embedded environments, not so important with desktops.Since as you might have guessed people who use BusyBox don't have much disk space or memory, if you don't need some of those programs then you don't compile them into the single executable. This means the program takes less disk space AND less RAM needs to be used to hold the executable in memory.",

        "body": "Remember \"problem solving\" in programming is all about making programs that does some 'thing' that someone needs a program to do. It doesn't have to be actual \"problems\", it can be something as simple as creating a program that tells you which day of the week a certain date is - that is solving the problem of \"wanting to know which day of the week a certain date is\".So the problems you should work to solve are very much related to the kind of programming you can do and the kind of programming you want to do.For me, back when I was learning, it was all about games. Simple board or paper games like **tic-tac-toe** and **solitaire** (where you jump over pins), **hangman** and **rock-paper-scissors**. But also \"action\" games, mostly simple shoot'em'ups where you move a spaceship around and try to shoot or avoid oncoming enemies - and of course 2D 'grid'-games like **sokoban** and various **zelda**\\-clones.If you are not into games, and want to write something that runs purely textbased, that can also be fun and simple. Some small projects that I still occasionally enjoy are programs to convert numbers like 123 to words like \"one hundred and twenty three\", or to/from roman numerals. Also just silly little experiments with inputs and branching, like a stupid chat-bot that doesn't really understands what you are writing, but just looks for keywords.I like to think of it as being creative with LEGO bricks - you have a collection of sets, with instructions, and you've seen how you can use the bricks you have to build those sets. Now if you take all the sets apart, what else could you maybe build with the same bricks? Could you make a spaceship or a western town or a ghost train? Just having some vague idea, and trying to connect bricks will get you a long way - and the cool thing about programming is that you never run out of bricks, but you sometime have to learn just a tiny bit more (add a few more bricks to your collection) to build exactly what you want.So start with assessing your collection of \"bricks\" - what kind of problems could you solve with what you have?",

I also dissected the sample programs that came with QBasic on MS-DOS (and hacked out the sound so we could play it in class without the teacher noticing).The real blast was when I found a Connect Four implementation written in Pascal on a school computer.

Knowing that applications, and more importantly your written scripts, can expose themselves to a specific port in your PC so that other programs may interact to your program using APIs through that port made everything connect.",

My first project was, I own a lot of movies and series a combination of DVDs, and Blu-Rays. When friends came over they would go, can I borrow this i'd love to watch it. Then maybe 2 weeks to a month later I would get it back. I didn't mind this, but my memory is bad due to an illness, bad enough that I have purchased a movie twice before, because I thought I had lost it only to get it back from a friend later. So I made an app in PHP + MySQL database my preferred language to keep track of my movies, what medium it was DVD or Blu-Rays, actors/actresses, directors and whether it was lend out or not, and who borrowed it from me. Later I found jreklund/php4dvd on Github. It's much much better than what I did, with IMDB integration and a fancy layout with covers and all. But I still appreciate what I learned making my own.Another project I made was my own version of [https://pinboard.in/](https://pinboard.in/) Both of these is something I made to use myself. I did share my movie database thing on Github because I made it before I was aware of php4dvd.I haven't put the bookmarks PHP script on Github because why would I when something like Pinboard exists. I easily could I think, I am honestly not sure, I just tried to code and replicate the features to have something to do, to keep coding and remembering PHP. If I don't code for a while I get very rusty, do we all do that?Anything I make that I think might be useful i put on repositories like Github or Bitbucket with a GPL open source license. If people find what I have made useful, I would really enjoy that. If I made something people can learn from by reading the code even better. And I just like the GPL idea, from enjoying Open source in general and using Linux.I hope some of this is useful to you.",

They want to know that you can code, that you aren't lost as soon as you're pushed on something, and that you'll be able to do the *kinds* of work they do if not the specifics. If they set you a technical challenge of some kind, just don't overthink it. Break it down to its simplest form and write it one step at a time. At the end of the day, being able to explain what you're trying to do and why is often more important than succeeding at the challenge.

The way you tackle a problem is very similar if not the same. The languages just give you a couple of different tools to do it but in my experience, my strategy for tackling a problem would be similar whether I did it in Java or C#.One thing I'd offer as advice is that if you're asked to solve a problem and you get stuck, think out loud. Tell them what you know, what you think you know, what you're trying to figure out, etc. It's easier for them to evaluate if they know what you're trying to figure out and they might even ask you some questions that might trigger something to help you solve the problem. You're not expected to know everything but if they feel that you're teachable then you might be what they're looking for.",

Algorithms, as in *Data Structures and Algorithms* - the standard Algorithms, are topics for later, once you already have acquired some programming proficiency and need to enhance your skills.Especially in the early stages of programming, it is a good idea to sit down with pencil and paper and manually devise your solutions. What system you use, flowcharts, pseudocode, bulleted lists, prose description doesn't matter. Develop *your* (the person) solutions before attempting to program. This will considerably reduce the barrier.Partly the above paragraph is the reason Harvard's CS50 starts with *Scratch*, a visual programming language designed for children learning programming. It loosely resembles the graphics of \"Nassi-Shneiderman Charts\", another approach to drawing algorithms. This approach helps focusing on the actual *program*, on the *steps* to solve a problem without getting tied up in programming language syntax. Personally, I think that this is a great approach to learning programming - especially in the beginning stage.",

        "body": "When you are first starting, some people find flowcharts easier to understand. They are a graphical representation so it is \"friendly\" in some way. Explaining procedures that involve branching (\"conditions\" in non-techie speak) to non-programmers is also often done with a flowchart and \"not\" pseudocode, by the way. So in some way, flowcharts seem to be naturally are intuitive to all audiences. Personally I think it's due to the uses of little arrows that can point in whichever direction. And I think it's been shown that most humans have a sort of \"spatial memory\" of sorts, so if you're following such a diagram you can think of each box of the logic as a little room in which you are standing. Following another arrow goes to another room, and so on. Also you can add little pictures, colors, etc. to such a digram to make it more fun, if you want.However, when you're actually writing out code, a lot of people don't like to draw that much (at least I don't). If I'm thinking about how to do a problem on a whiteboard, or on paper, then I prefer \"pseudocode\".One time I \"do\" prefer a diagram, though, is whenever there's a \"state machine\" in the code, or if I'm implementing a data structure that has a natural graphical or tabular representation (e.g. lists, trees, matrices, etc.). In such a case, I like the graphical representation but I will heavily abbreviate it in writing. But in the code I will use clear labels at each state for maintainability/\"greppability\" purposes.So in summary: you should ultimately aim to learn to read/write all forms of these ways of expressing a program. The flowchart and/or pseudocode are intended to be \"programming language\" neutral and to be read by a human. You are supposed to read them and then implement it in a natural way in whatever programming language happens to be your favourite (or the one which you happen to be using).",

When I have a good business idea, I keep it to myself, because I'm building a small business.Just build something you think would be cool, that interests you, that fills some sort of need you've identified.You've got to remember, programming typically involves a screen/user interface. There's only so much you can do through a screen, unless you tie it to external assets/processes. Everything is a button. It's almost always CRUD (create, read, update, delete).Everything has already been done, that's not the point. Try to think up something useful, you think people need, and program that (even if it's a small resource, or blog).**EDIT:** For me, I mostly build websites for small businesses (which I really enjoy), and I enjoy programming (somewhat obsessively), so those are my motivations. Not \"building something that's never been built before\".",

Absolutely. Are they written in Go? Nope.Are there MMO servers I could *attempt* to bend to my will? Yes. Are they written in Go? Nope.I used to help write the net code for MANGOS project 15 years ago in C++, so I'm leaning heavily on that to implement most of those functions in my Go server, as for the client, a good amount of Engine logic can be taken from others and used in my project.At the end of the day, it's just how much drive you have to want to learn. Someone made a wooden wheel, then someone else took that wheel, made it metal, then someone else developed a tire. Everything can be incremented on to be made better.

It's not the fastest or the most reliable or the one that supports most experimenting, but it's distinctly above average on most criteria. You'll have to pair this with either vanilla HTML or a front-end framework, which will increase the learning curve, sadly.Electron and Tauri are convenient ways to ship desktop (and mobile) applications written in TypeScript (or JavaScript) that will work on all operating systems.",

If you get lucky, the boss will understand the value of custom solutions and you might cause a new role to be created at the company where you identify something that is difficult to do with spreadsheets and give them a proper database solution.For example - I heard from an associate in the medical industry that there were some old documents they needed to reconcile. Data was spread across multiple pages and they were tasked with building 1 unified document by cross referencing names and other data between the documents. I offered my scripting knowledge and we figured something out that did all of the work in a few seconds - for a task estimated to take many weeks of man hours.But bosses can be resistant to change or stubborn or complacent with how things are.

C++ can also be brutally slow to compile.* If you have a desktop machine of any kind at home, you will really appreciate the ability to `ssh` into that machine to compile larger things.* Back when I was using it, Crostini had a ton of subtle, annoying bugs in it that made the system kinda unstable. It wasn't particularly fun, and I finally ended up installing custom firmware on it so that I could put a mainstream Linux distribution on it.* My particular model of Chromebook was really poorly supported by the upstream Linux kernel for a long time and required a patched kernel to get things like the keyboard and touchpad to work properly.

But it also depends on your country, it's not the same everywhere.If you really want to be a computer science engineer or work in cybersecurity, depending on how things are in your country, you're probably going to have to put in a significant amount of work in your resume and may need to apply to quite a few jobs just to get one.It's harder to land a profession today than it is to land working at a restaurant or retail store.If I could give you my \"best recipe for life\" suggestion, it would be to work in real life, and do programming as a hobby. A lot of peoples' egos go \"ewww, labor! but i want to go above and beyond\", but they end up overworking themselves and realizing that office work wasn't as great or as fun as they thought.As a hobby programmer, I've made a couple very helpful open source projects, and a lot of fun stuff involving mods for video games. I've also created a few of my own games myself, including both using game engines, and without game engines in pure programming languages.It can be a very fun creative outlet, and when you don't have time pressure behind your back, the problems you encounter can be *fun* instead of annoying; like interesting puzzles to solve.So, programming as a hobby, as long as you don't do it too much, can make for a healthy balanced life and even give you a creative outlet you didn't think of before. Programming as a *profession* you are not guaranteed to land even if you try, and even if you do land it, you might realize it isn't actually enjoyable in the long run.>ill be studying animation in polytechnic in MalaysiaI've taken some classes in animation before.

Animation is a fun hobby, especially making fun little lego animations, flipbooks, etc. But once you start getting serious with it, or taking professional courses, at least in my country, then it gets a lot harder.I've also heard from animators on the internet that their job is a struggle, that AI is concerning them about displacement, and that they're having difficulty whether they're YouTubers or employees at a company.Just google \"is animation very competitive\" and you'll find search results.",

The reason I think you should do python first is the CS50w has A LOT of django tasks with little hand holding. Then after you finish those 2 you will have all the skills needed to just start building stuff (and that's what you should do at that point)Freecodecamp and The Odin Project are good suggestions as well and tend to be a little \"easier\" in my opinion but the fact you did the whole CS50 means you definitely can handle the less hand holding features of FCC and TOP",

If it doesn't suit you, don't think that it's the only way for you to grow as a programmer. If you get good on your own or by other methods, you're gonna land a job anyway. Be more demanding, ask more questions as they are there to help you and prepare you so that you work for them and they profit off of it. And remember, you are an intern - so be easy on yourself.

However, C# can be used in game engines like Unity.Saying it's the \"best\" for game design is hard to prove. There are many choices that are arguably better, depending on your goals. That said, it's a good language to learn if game design is your ultimate goal.As for tips:- Don't use AI.- If you use AI anyway, don't ask it to generate code and paste it in without understanding what it does.- Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Just try things.- I wouldn't jump straight into game dev. Try to get a basic understanding of the language with console apps or Windows Forms first.C# is a \"typed\" programming language. Every variable you define has a \"type.\" IE: ints are numbers, strings are text, chars are letters. You can use or define more complex types. For example, you could have a variable called \"player\" with a complex structure to represent the player's position, velocity, health, etc.C# is a \"managed\" programming language. You don't have to worry about directly allocating memory, or cleanly exiting your app— that's all handled for you.",

It will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right?Correct, dereferencing a pointer after the end of the lifetime of the object it points to is [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and technically, the program is allowed to do absolutely anything from that point on.This doesn't just apply to memory allocated with `malloc`. It also applies to local variables, whose lifetime ends when at the end of the corresponding function or block.> Is there any downside to always using this macro, rather than always writing 2 lines manually?Well, the C preprocessor is just a dumb text substitution engine. So in terms of the compiled code, using your macro is exactly the same as writing the statements directly. (The [`do { ... } while (0)` construct](https://c-faq.com/cpp/multistmt.html) is a trick to make the macro behave correctly as though it were a single statement.)The biggest issue I have with your macro is that the name is misleading. It's not really \"safe\" because it doesn't prevent the underlying problem. In particular, if you ever pass around copies of a pointer (which is common) then just setting one copy to `NULL` doesn't affect the other copies. So if you're uncertain whether an object has been freed, then checking whether the pointer is `NULL` is not reliable on its own, unless you also know that nowhere else in your program is calling `free` on a copy of the pointer.And likewise, calling `SAFE_FREE` on a local pointer variable is not *necessary* when the pointer variable is going out of scope. If the variable is disappearing, it doesn't matter whether you set it to `NULL`. (In fact, the compiler would probably optimize out the assignment statement.)If I were reading your code and I saw something like `SAFE_FREE`, I would have to look up the macro definition anyway to see what it was actually doing in terms of memory management. Writing `free(ptr); ptr = NULL;` directly is clearer, in my opinion.In general, C is a language that *demands* you constantly pay attention to memory management at all times. This is just a habit you need to develop. Other languages provide better tools to assist you with this. For instance, C++ has \"smart pointers\" that act as an abstraction layer above regular pointers. The smart pointer is responsible for knowing when it's safe to call `free` on the underlying pointer.",

You are correct. If you incorrectly try to resuse something that you alread \"freed\" then there is no rule that says that your program will crash. It is however undefined behaviour, so the technique you are quoting here is a fine one, and many programmers do that. It is a well-known technique that is commonly used, which is probably the reason the LLM is giving it to you as if it is something special.As mentioned elsewhere, the benefit of using a macro here is perhaps slim to none. When I've seen this done in code, it's normally just done without a macro, by using an explicit assignment of NULL to the pointer after the deallocation is done. free(my_ptr); my_ptr = NULL;The same thing is done when programming in C++, when using new and delete (many C++ programmers will assign the pointer a value of NULL or nullptr after delete'ing it).Clearly, setting the pointer to a value of NULL should not be needed, but the reason it's considered \"safer\" is because it \"almost guarantees\" the behaviour later if you do make a mistake and try to reuse that pointer. For example, if you \"accidentally\" call free again on that pointer again down the line (I don't know why you would), then free is guaranteed to do nothing in that case.The more important mistake that you want to catch is if your code accidentally deferences that pointer later on as if it were still pointing to valid data. If it's a NULL pointer (because you are using the \"safe\" technique\"), then on all systems I've seen, dereferencing the NULL pointer will crash the program. Formally speaking, though, derefencing a NULL pointer is either undefined behaviour or \"implementation defined\". But for all practical purposes, you can rely on a derefence of NULL being a fatal event on most systems (at least on all Desktop systems). It's a bit funny that we consider crashing the program to be \"safer\" than not crashing, but it turns out it's much easier to debug a crash caused by a null pointer dereference (i.e. \"segmentation fault\" on Linux) than it would be to debug accidentally dereferencing a \"stale\" pointer that was pointing to some old data.",

In the second SAFE\\_FREE, you're setting the passed pointer to NULL, and it goes away as well. The pointer that matters is the outer pointer, which is *not* set to NULL.I'd say that, unless you're legitimately writing lots of free/nulling pairs, the macro is not only going to not help, but it's going to give a false sense of security. You need to set pointers to NULL in a meaningful way, and that often means NULLing them some place besides where the *physical* free takes place, happening more where the *logical* free is occurring (e.g. destroyFoo being the logical destruction point).Only you can say whether it will help you or not. It may be a less verbose approach. But I wouldn't consider it a *safer* option if it stops you from actually thinking about who is owning memory and making sure that state is handled consistently, not just looking locally at the point where the actual memory freeing occurs.Edit: if you had a function like destroyFoo, you could make it take a Foo\\*\\* (pointer to the pointer) and then NULL the outer pointer out at the end. That just pushes it up a level though. You'd still have to be careful to apply it to the primary held pointer and not some copy of it.",

        "body": "While in this situation there’s not much difference, each has very specific use cases. Enums are generally used as like a switch… lets say you had something with three different states, Running, Idling, or Off. While you could store this as a dictionary or array, this is what Enums are built for. They are a very simple data structure. Arrays are best for lists. Most languages support adding new items to your array, removing items from your array and have support for doing something to every item in an array. While in this case, you have an array of strings, commonly the elements within the array are more complex. Consider storing a list of books… you will want an author, a book name, a genre, for each item in the list. Enums can’t do this, and while a dictionary could, there are some drawbacks to using a dictionary in this way. Dictionaries are great for things like your actual book object. They have constant time access, so it’s easy to store a value and look up a value in this way. You can also assign more complex values to dictionaries, not just strings, which makes them better for anything more complex than an enum. They however are not the easiest to iterate through, and adding values requires you to also have a key to store the value to. For most languages, the keys are not ordered either, which is why for a changing list an array is better. Hope that helps!",

Enums are technically faster, but that rarely matters.What is a huge difference though, is the errors you might get when compiling and the help your editor gives you in avoiding those errors.If you tried this with the enum version: print(fruitColor[Fruit.PEACH])you would get an error telling you that PEACH isn't defined, and you'd probably discover it early when trying to write PEACH, and autocomplete didn't help at all!But if you tried this similar thing with the dict version: print(fruitToColourDict[\"peach\"])you would get a print or NULL or Undefined, or nothing, depending on the exact language used. You probably wouldn't be told that \"peach\" did not exist in the dict, and you also wouldn't get any hints from the autocompletion while writing it, that it might be wrong. Enums aren't just \"lists of words\", they should be considered more like a custom variable-type, like a boolean that can be `true` or `false`, you can create your own types, like a return value that can be `true`, `false` or `fileNotFound`. They are extremely useful when writing code, because you always know that you only use values that the rest of the program will expect.Dicts on the other hand, are used more when you don't know all the possible values when writing the program - and you might want the program itself to add more keys to the list of known values.",

You can't add to them or remove from them.For Dict vs array, if you want to find something in an array you need to loop through it and compare.This is slow, especially on a hot path (something that is called often, e.g. in a loop)You won't see much of a difference in simple code that doesn't do much, or with small arrays, but as you get into thousands of objects, using a dictionary to store a reference to something that is not an index will be far faster than an array search.As always, it depends on what you have and what you want to do.",

If you're able to handle yourself during an interview, your chances grow dramatically. You don't need to know all the answers, but it's important to communicate honestly about what you know and don't, and to seem like a good addition to the team. It's a very good idea to, for example, instead of saying \"I don't know.\" say \"I'm not that familiar with this right now, but I'm actually very interested to find out more about it first thing on the project\" etc. Be able to say basic stuff about most reasonable areas during the interview, even if it seems trivial (like, if you've only heard a few words about contexts in react, do say it's a way to pass data between components, but you had no chance to use them yet and you're very interested to become more familiar with them the first chance you get). Don't expect to do too well during your first interview either. Don't sweat about any practical challenges either, I've been mostly interviewing senior engineers for the last couple of years and you'd never believe me how they generally struggle with relatively simple coding tasks. If you need some more help feel free to reach out, in some future I'm interested in potentially reaching out for help from some junior devs in Poland, so I'll save your post too.",

The second one `i < 10` gets executed before every loop iteration, and terminates the loop if it evaluates to false. The third one `i++` executes after every loop iteration. Exactly the same code can be written as int i = 0; while (i < 10) { //this part gets executed 10 times i++; }It should be fairly easy to understand how this works.

There is \"knowledge in the world\" and \"knowledge in your head\". There's a ton of knowledge out there, and it's impossible to have it all in your head. Plus what you need to know changes over time, with different jobs, different projects, different situations.If you sit me down with a task, I will probably not know the approach to take straight away. But I'll be able to not only work out the approach but also implement it. That is what you do day in and day out in a software development job, at least if you're not just cranking the same code out over and over.The \"always manage to screw up in the end\" is the part to work on. Figure out how you screwed up and take that forward by not doing it again. They say an expert is just someone who has already made all the mistakes.

One of my more recent self directed projects(company gives out bonuses for lean/Six Sigma work if it saves time or money) was implementing a machine learning vision QC system because I was annoyed that they kept bringing up materials waste and false failures as well as false passes at meetings without anyone coming up with real solutions.Wasn't too tricky because it leveraged both of my fields of knowledge - with vision stuff being a core part of automation engineering and ML being a core part of data science. I 'acquired' some high definition cameras from the stock room because it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission and set up a test station to work with. Stupid thing was the company already had some kind of setup like this but it was automatically failing everything and they didn't know how to fix it, so I wasn't working from scratch and had a *lot* of data on hand to work with.The current process as of 9 months ago now is that instead of each part being inspected manually with microscopes, which is slow and has a lot of human flaws due to the product being high grade optical gear, it gets placed in a fixture, the operator presses a button to activate the program which then snaps a photo and scans it for flaws, highlights anything outside of spec which is then passed on to a quality technician, and is otherwise cleared for use down the line. The machine learning aspect mostly applies to parts that are less easily measurable by humans.

I have a bafflingly wide variety of skillsets just because my first job after graduation required me to learn how to fix stuff as an electrical technician in a factory. Came out of school knowing the bare basics of PLCs, electronics, and robotics. Then suddenly I had to learn how machinery worked and interacted with other sections, service lasers, look at code far more complex than anything I'd ever seen before, solve physical problems without actual pre-determined solutions, reprogram stuff completely outside of my realm of expertise(like vision QC) because there were no engineers on my shift at night. A lot of the time it really sucked but the mindset I was able to form out of it, which is to say being able to take a wide overview and draw on many different areas to look for solutions to problems, has been invaluable. Some of the stuff was much older than me, basically nothing was uniform, and a bunch of the programming was in German. I do not speak German. Actually only met several of the engineers at the current gig because while I was testing out some equipment I overheard them complaining about a camera system we had for measuring extreme temperature variance on the products and how the guy who does it is on vacation. Poked my head in and went \"oh hey you guys are looking at Cognex? I know how that stuff works\" because at my first job I had needed to configure a ton of them and work within the software more than a few times.

This is not too difficult; any scalable, modern, hosting provider — like Vercel — should be able to handle this with no issues. You'll simply want to check that you can afford whatever they are going to charge you, so this simply involves being familiar with their pricing structure.Finally, we come to what you said — \"10k concurrent users\". This is a *really* rare situation — this is going to be getting close to a really popular website on the Internet. At this point, there's no guidebook on a guaranteed, step-by-step way to handle this. You'll need to have a lot of logging in place, so that you have visibility into load times, and exactly *where* are the slowdowns. Once you know that, you can start figuring out solutions to speed up those specific slowdowns. However, it's important that you know *where* the slowdowns are first, because it's a bit waste of time to optimize something, only to find out that that wasn't the true slowdown.To test this, you can use one of the many load-testing software tools out there, once you have appropriate logging in place.",

With time, as you get more experience, you will solidify your knowledge about the things you use regularly (it is a lifelong marathon, not a sprint).Start with small projects; do not overcomplicate things (divide tasks into smaller tasks and prioritize: https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/productivity/task-prioritization/), build a solid foundation (make sure you challenge your assumptions). As you get more comfortable, add more complexity. Try not to get stressed, learn how you learn best, and be prepared to fail time to time (it is part of the learning process).",

I should be doing it right now instead of writing this, but I need a break from all the documents I'm currently reading.Software engineering moves quickly. Things change daily. It's a career that you can't do well unless you are someone who is willing to constantly learn. Today I'm researching some AWS configuration so I can design some messages flow architecture. Yesterday I was looking into some errors with third party software. Tomorrow I'll be learning something else. That's the job. Or at least a large part of it. People think writing software is mainly typing. It is. If you're a programmer. If you're a software engineer then the job is research, learning, thinking, designing. Then 20 minutes of typing. Be a software engineer.As an aside. If you're trying to learn something like cancellation tokens then spend a few hours designing your own cancellation token. How would you do it if someone asked you to? It's actually not that hard. I mean it is, but the basics are fairly simple. Designing it to production level quality is significantly harder. But you don't need to do that to learn the raw basics.If I had a junior engineer who \"wasted\" a morning building their own basic cancellation system to learn how it works I would be impressed. And I'd give them the slightly more complex work to do and nudge them in the right direction. As a junior your current job is to learn. Not write software. You can write software once you've learned how. Part of that is writing software to gain experience. But all of the job is learning. You're not currently productive enough to be useful. You will be. But your job isn't to be productive yet. It's to learn to be productive.",

If there's no interesting problems that you want to solve, how about a game?In high school when we were learning c++ we made a number guessing game. The rules of the game are as follows: 1. Generate a random number from 1 to 100 (or whatever range you prefer) 2. Prompt the user for a number guess3. Read user input 4. Convert user input to a number so you can compare it to your secret number5. Tell the user whether their guess is higher or lower than the secret number6. Loop steps 2-5 until the number is guessed, and then exit the loop and print a victory messageIt might not sound the most exciting, but practice is good even for simple ideas. Games can be an engaging way to learn. They can also get way more complex than most \"real\" software for business. If you try making a few simple games and then go for something more complex (maybe use the ebiten engine to get some 2d graphics) you'll become vastly more skilled.That is similar to my path, except I had Java 7(?) with basic swing graphics and later lwjgl engine. I love go now, though! It's not the best option for building a game client, but it's fun to work with. It is better suited to making a game server.

Once you can make simple programs and understand variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and classes, jump into something like Flask or Django.Working with a larger code base is good to see how programming will be in the real world and you’ll pick up good habits from those frameworks. Means to an end? In the nicest way, don’t waste your time. Programming is a lifetime of learning new things and spending hours on not only creating new things, but finding tiny bugs in thousands of lines of code. If you’re not passionate about it, you will burn out and ultimately waste your time (and sometimes money if you join a bootcamp or something). It takes a ton of failing through an attempt to create projects where you’ll actually learn and make it into a useful skill.",

Let's look at his assertions**Learn this language and you're set for life**Python is popular and it will get you far, but much like learning a second (or third language), you gain a better appreciation of the first language and its quirks when you learn a second one. Most find the second language intolerable because it does things differently from the first, especially if the language is quite a bit different. If you went from C to C++, that's like learning more C. If you go from C# to Java, they will feel like similar languages. If you go from Python to Java, Java would likely seem way to verbose and too concerned with types.It's nice to know a few other languages, but for now, getting decent at Python is a good first step.**Learn Selenium**OK, that's out of left field. If you can't build a web page, learning Selenium seems advanced. It's often used to run automated steps on a browser, often for testing purposes. It's a little like learning to fix a car before you learn how to drive. I suppose it can be done, but it seems advanced.I wouldn't worry about Selenium for now.**Taking a Course**There is a free course here: https://programming-25.mooc.fi/This is a real college course and there are some quizzes and such. You don't get credit, but at least it's structured.You could also try: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/It's a little hard to set up initially, and I think it goes into non-standard topics at the end, but it's also good. It was developed by the folks at Harvard.You'd probably spend a year (or at least 6 months) learning to program half-decently. I think some feel they need a few years to feel somewhat comfortable. It does vary widely from person to person as some people find it easy to pick up (rare) or they just don't get it at all (rare). You seem like you're in the middle.Stuff to learn* Control flow (if, while, function calls)* File I/O* Functions* ClassesPython doesn't really force you to write your own functions or even classes, but it's good to learn them.Afterwards, you'd learn some basic data structures* Queues, stacks* Trees* Dictionaries* Graphs* Sorting algorithms* Binary search through a sorted arrayAs another person suggested Automate the Boring Stuff (free online) spends ten chapters going over Python, then has ten more chapters (or so), each devoted to one thing you could automate. Pick the ones that interest you.There is a follow-up course after CS50p called CS50w where you learn web-programming using Python.",

You use a while loop when you can’t but know when to stop. People reading your code will recognize those two patterns. If you get fancy or irregular you’ll end up making them pause to actually think about what you’re doing, which is slightly annoying if there wasn’t a good reason (and if there is there should be a comment explaining the loop).

        "body": "Let me tell you one thing about salary, it’s not about the capability you have but rather the leverage you have against the company. Sure the capabilities you have will land you the job. But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you. Don’t limit yourself to one stack though. Try to learn the basics for a few others so you know what you like best. For example Angular, Vue, etc.(My bias is for react and next.js though :squinting_face_with_tongue:)",

When you create \"pull requests\" with your fixes, more experienced programmers will have to review them and guide you further. What's more important, you will have to read and comprehend a lot of code written by others, which will teach you a lot about how to reason about complex programming problems and how to break them down into constituent pieces.

After each session, you may reflect on what you have learned and how it may fit with other things you have already learned (like drawing a map of uncharted areas and connecting roads to already explored areas). Ask yourself questions, like, \"How can this be used in any of my other projects?\". Try not to memorize every detail; learn the big picture, how things are connected, and learn useful words that you can use to look up details. Things you use often tend to stick in memory after a while.Have your own pet projects, apply what you have learned in different tutorials, and look up any missing details as you go along. The key is that you, at some point, need to remove the training wheels and be able to build projects on your own.",

If you store a double or integer, it's going to be at some location, right? However, it can't appear just anywhere. It might be the case that an integer *must* appear at an address that is a multiple of 4.That's what \"Alignof\" gives you. Why would you want that? Honestly, unless you are dealing with low level stuff (drivers and such) you will probably never care about this.As for Kea DHCP, this is a DHCP server. DHCP is a network management protocol and in order to understand what it is you need to know a few things about networks.So I wouldn't necessarily expect you to understand either of these. The documentation likely won't assume you are starting from scratch. It's going to assume a generate familiarity with the domain. Just as a document that describes how to adjust the timing on a Chevy 350 is going to assume you know what a car is and where to find the engine in the car (pro-tip: it's in the front).",

        "body": "Sorry if this is unsatisfying, but the only general answer I can give you is \"it depends on the situation\".Any tool or library needs some amount of background knowledge in order to understand how and why to use it. If the documentation tried to explain *all* that background knowledge, it would be very very long.Whoever was writing the documentation had some idea in their head of what the reader would want to know, and what they would already be familiar with. If your level of knowledge doesn't match that assumption, then you'll have to figure out yourself where the gaps are.The only real solution is to increase your breadth of knowledge as much as possible. That way, when you encounter an unfamiliar concept, you'll at least have a better chance of recognizing where the gap in your knowledge is, and having an idea of where to research.As for your specific examples:> “Alignof takes an expression x of any type and returns the required alignment of a hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x. It is the largest value m such that the address of v is always zero mod m. It is the same as the value returned by…”This requires some general knowledge of CPU architectures. If you're telling the CPU to access (for instance) a 4-byte value in memory, then the memory access is called \"aligned\" if the starting address is a multiple of 4, and \"unaligned\" otherwise.Alignment matters because on some CPU architectures, unaligned memory access is just not allowed, and on others, it's slower than aligned access (or has other downsides, e.g. not being atomic). The exact alignment requirements vary depending on the platform and the data type. For instance, if a struct contains any 4-byte variables, then the struct itself must be aligned to a multiple of at least 4 bytes, even if its actual size is different.For that reason, the compiler normally takes care to automatically align the memory addresses of all variables based on their types. If you're doing low-level stuff with the `unsafe` package, it's assumed that you're aware of this kind of low-level detail.> “Designed to Integrate with Your Existing Systems. Kea allows you to separate the data from the execution environment, enabling new deployment options.” In my opinion, this is mostly marketing-speak, not technical documentation. The target audience is a somebody like a manager or CTO. The goal is to make them think \"hmm, that looks good\" and then either buy the product or tell their technical underlings to look at it in more detail.(Even though this particular product is open source, the organization that maintains it sells support subscriptions, and the website looks strikes me as very businessy rather than technical.)If you read [the more technical documentation](https://downloads.isc.org/isc/kea/3.0.0/doc/html/arm/admin.html), what they actually mean is that the state of the DHCP server -- mainly, the list of allocated leases -- can be stored on a separate database server, which the DHCP server itself accesses over a network connection. This could make sense for organizations that already have established \"infrastructure\" e.g. a team that maintains their database servers, and they want to reuse that infrastructure instead of setting up something new.",

        "body": "I like to say that the documentation usually assumes that the reader knows absolutely everything about the language/API/framework, except for one tiny detail, the one being described on the page they are reading.It often feels like a bit of a catch-22 situation, because you won't understand the documentation before you've learned the language, and you won't understand the language before you've read and understood the documentation!What I suggest is that when you use something - like when a tutorial or other course shows you to write something specific, and you more or less understand what it is doing, *then* go and read the documentation for that thing! See how much of it you understand, and don't worry about all the details you don't get - they might not be important, or you might learn them later.The next time you need to solve a similar task, but with a bit of a twist, so you can't do exactly the same, go back to the documentation, and see if it helps you. Often there are links to other things that does similar things.Example: You've seen someone using .trim() in JavaScript to remove whitespace around user-input, and you've looked at [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trim), and read that \"The `trim()` method of [`String`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) values removes whitespace from *both ends* of this string and returns a new string, without modifying the original string.\" - cool - now you need to only trim the end of the string, not the beginning. So you go back to the documentation, and read it again, checking if you missed something, and behold, it also says: \"To return a new string with whitespace trimmed from just one end, use [`trimStart()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trimStart) or [`trimEnd()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trimEnd).\" with links to other methods that does exactly what you want.That is how you can use the documentation to learn.I'd recommend against starting reading documentation for a package / module / interface you've never used before, because more often than not, it doesn't actually tell you how to get started just doing \"something\" with it. Build something first, then read, then build it better!",

Within 2 weeks of having it on it on my linkedin I was getting offers from factories all over for conveyor/sorter programming. It's obviously a very different job than traditional SWE as my day started in the maintenance \"crib\" with a bunch of physical laborers, talking about what areas of the facility need work and adjustment. But I would walk around with my laptop on a sling hooking up to conveyors and scanners, checking read rates and making adjustments to timings based on failing motors or air pneumatics. It felt good to see direct influence from the changes and the goal was simply to keep the facility running which felt really gratifying.",

        "body": "If you want to leverage your background in software you could: - go into QA. The kind of QA where you develop software to test the main system but that software never gets released elsewhere. Tools that do test setup, stress tests, volume tests, etc. This isn’t necessarily a forever job but one that will let you reset. - find a field far divorced from what you’ve done; if you were in banking go work at a transportation company; different problem set; different vibe. ————Ask yourself what you really mean when you say your ‘work is disappearing into the void’. Describe out loud or in writing where you’d want your work to appear: I would: - loved to have worked on developing the iPhone- been responsible for part of SpaceX program - written the program that detected fraud or cyber attacks - …Now ask yourself what you like doing and whether there is a need for software in that industry. Another thing is to take a few weeks off and then look back at what went wrong at your old job. Write down phrases that capture the culture or how you felt: - too many impossible deadlines- always picking up for other people’s delays and mistakes - sales over promised features; they got the bonus but we got the work - all the tech was over ten years old - no one would embrace new ideas - always got blame if something went wrong but never got credit for all the things that went rightNow ask - what could you have done differently. This is a great opportunity to learn from your mistakes. —————-Personal recommendation regarding getting laid off after all those years: take some time. Add up all the weeks, days, months you worked rather than taking vacation. You’re long overdue. Take a few weeks to disconnect. But first - let a few industry contacts know that you’re available but will be out of touch for 2-3 weeks. You’ll reach out when you return. Of course, you can time the emails release when you’re about to return as well. Just don’t burden yourself with job hunting and interviews while you’re decompressing and handling the change. My best idea for disconnecting was camping around an area I’d never visited. Left the phone in the car so I didn’t look at it all day. Did some fishing, swimming, hiking. Lots of physical activity - very little mental activity. Before you start to feel guilty that you’re not chasing the next thing immediately you should realize that you’re:A) still thinking about the old jobB) stressed out & might leave a poor impression C) dealing with some financial uncertainty All of these are stressors that could affect your demeanor during an interview. ——————-Now that you’re back put together your search plan: 1. Who do you let know you’re available 2. What type of work/environment do you want 3. Has your experience changed the relative importance of ‘things I want in a job’? —- some people realize that stability is far more important to them than they realized—- others see this as breaking chains that held them to a location 4. Consider doing some short term tech consulting - not necessarily programming. During one break I did network installation once the wires were pulled; I did database maintenance and reorganization; did some sys admin cleanup work. Things that were tech related but not development. I always found lots of little things that organizations never got around to that had big impact. Did a full database backupRan the purge routine for old data Re-orged the database Rebuilt the indexes Suddenly the system is 10x faster. Customer was happy; salesman was happier. ——————————————————Set up your daily schedule: 1. Manage list of current jobs being pursued2. Identify new opportunities3. Network with people about the jobs listed in both 1 and 2. 4. Network with people ‘without asking for a job’; just catching up; things have changed; just talking to people while i figure out what’s next; …. Let them suggest others to speak with & prompt them 5. Get some exercise; burn off tension; 6. Take advantage of any programs whether financial or search related ( unemployment insurance, job placement boards ) ————————-WRT wanting out of tech: Think about leveraging your way out. Had a colleague who worked to develop a risk management system for derivative trading. In doing so he learned as much about derivatives as any of the traders. Got an interview and got hired as a trader at a smaller firm. So have you developed any non-programming skills while developing a system? Anything in which you’re interested and can be competitive? Would you want to run a small consulting firm? Lots of other things required other than software development: marketing, sales, contract negotiation, project management, resource management, payroll and other admin. Frankly the repetitiveness of that caused me to dislike that role so I hired someone to run the firm. What’s your personality like? Could you do software sales? Or software sales support? Often ex-developers are an asset to a sales organization because they are more believable due to their experience ( and they tend to tell the truth about what’s possible and what’s not). ——————Best of luck.",

It comes in two flawors: IT architect in the stile of Amazon / Azure. Basically is a more experienced developer. Not sure if that is what you want. But for someone that is fresh of programming should be easy to get the certifications. There is the second flawor, which is Enterprise Architect. Keyword here TOGAF certification. Good career prospect in big corporations that have to enforce standards across various department and keep in the IT (and shadow IT) in check. Very little, if no, programming in this case.\\- IT Service Manager. Basically the guy that ensure that the IT landscape is up and running in an economical way. Keword ITIL certification. Very little, if no programming here.\\- DevOps. Still a good portion of programming, but more focused on scripting and testing. \\- Legal for IT. This probably would require more than a simple certification. But there is a lot (I mean a lot) of request of people with IT skills and knowledge of the legal aspects associated to contracts, licenses, privacy aspects and their implications. Probably a bachelor may be required to work in this field. No programming needed to do this job though. In any of the previous companies I have worked for (all big corporations), this was usually a very very difficult position to fill.\\- Security expert. Keyword ISC square certificate. Is a mix of enforcing standard guidelines for cyber security in big corporations and cyber response. Probably would require a good deal of reskilling, but getting an entry job in this field should not be impossible.Last but not least. Get your burnout in check! Good luck for everything",

        "body": "Congrats on spotting the burnout before it completely consumed you. A lot of people let it boil over and ditch the entire industry because of itFor future reference, there's a middle-ground between sacrificing your mental health and burning out, and quitting cold turkey: Establishing very clear professional boundaries, and sticking to them no matter what.I value my WLB very much, it's literally the most important thing to me about the team I'm working on. If I somehow ended up on a team that had a bad WLB, I'd start looking for another job. I know I won't change that teams culture, it is what it is.Instead of quitting though, I'd make my boundaries very, very, very crystal clear, and I would stick to them. I'm available 9-5. Hard stop. That's not negotiable. If I'm asked to do something at 5:30, I just won't respond. Or if things aren't terrible and I still have a decent relationship with that person, at most I'll give them a courtesy: \"OK, I'll take a look first thing tomorrow morning\". I don't care if deadlines get missed, not my problem, that's a planning problem. I don't care what insane committments my boss made. I work 9-5.Boundaries are what let you escape work mode. I don't work after 5pm, and I've taught my brain that same boundary, so it doesn't think about working after 5pm. If you lack that boundary, you can't escape \"work mode\" *because you're always working*. Your brain knows you're always working. You taught it that, why would it let you turn that mode off?In the same vein, sounds like your boss was an ass, but I also don't let feedback get to me. I do my best, 8 hours a day. If my best isn't good enough, not my problem. They hired me, that was their mistake, not mine. If my boss hates my guts, thinks I'm underperforming, or using AI? Tough. I'm not thinking about that after 5pm, and I'll just smile and nod during my 9-5, without changing a thing.The reason boundaries like this are so important, and so powerful is it lets you keep your mental sanity, even when you're at an aggresive, fast paced, toxic company.If these boundaries aren't acceptable for your employer, guess what happens? They fire you, and you're *exactly* where you just put yourself voluntarily anyways. But the hidden truth people aren't talking about is it can takes months, sometimes *years* before a company decides to pull the trigger on firing you over this kind of stuff. So you just bought yourself a whole lot of time to search for another job on the side, all while staying sane.Keep these things in mind for your net gig. Props to standing up for yourself, but at the same time remember there's usually a happy middle-ground hiding between the 2 extreme options of quitting vs burning out.",

We are so much more than a paycheck. And wayyyy more than just our jobs. Someone below mentioned establishing boundaries, and I do agree with that. In this case, you were working under an aggressive (and frankly unrealistic) timeline:\\- Boundary 1 is not putting all the blame on you. Super-tight timelines? Hmm...maybe you could do something more, or maybe your boss overpromised to his customer, or maybe you're incredibly understaffed and asking to do work that one person alone shouldn't be responsible handling. \\- Boundary 2 is knowing when to switch off work when you log off your computer. It shouldn't keep you up at night. We are not surgeons, where one wrong mistake means that someone dies. We write code to make products. Like...the world will be ok. And so will you.Last thing is that people don't quit jobs; they quit managers. Your boss lacks the emotional intelligence that I would expect from someone managing people.

People tend to overweight their recent experiences psychologically, and thus make broad generalizations about the future based on what's been happening in the last 2-3 years.In 2021, tech had basically been in a straight upward boom since the Great Recession, and most people in the field now entered during that boom. This means they have no memory of past bust cycles, and they're experiencing one for the first time now. Because they assumed the party would never end, they were extremely shocked in 2022 when the market suddenly reversed course and layoffs began.As for the people saying \"but this time is different because AI\", it's important to remember that \"this time is different\" every time. In the mid-2000s, people had a panic over offshoring destroying the American tech industry, a fear that clearly never materialized.

As for everyone here freaking out, there definitely is relief coming, and that's the attrition in the field.

It honestly doesn't make much sense looking at the state of the tech market in general, there are other things in play - outsourcing, fictitious hype gravy trains, etc. Where every company was and should still be upkeeping their legacy systems, adding AI functionality, and the startup scene should be kicking full tilt (now more than ever). But it's not. The upper execs and boards are still increasing their take home and ownership at or above the same rate. It's really a tear in the system. Something is very wrong - and no I don't believe it was due to 'over hiring' during covid. It's probably more-so that they have been sitting and have so much pride in their infrastructure/office-space, their ping pong tables, etc. where those buildings were a massive shit investment (hence enforced RTO), where they were absolutely hemorrhaging money for years. They own other office spaces they were renting out to smaller companies - which if you drive around and peek at those alt-office spaces, they're still dormant. A lot of exuberant waste, where everyone could have been WFH the entire time (and likely more productive imo).",

For one, a lot of the core userbase of this sub come from tech hubs that have both the greatest abundance of jobs, the most investment into new tech startups, and are the most shielded from layoffs. Someone in SV will naturally have a more positive outlook than someone in Indiana or Slovakia.To build on the above, this sub falsely equivocates career success with being knowledgeable about the industry or even being a good developer, which is laughably untrue. This article is flawed, because contributions are more complicated than just commits, but it is true that something like [10% of developers contribute nothing](https://shiftmag.dev/ghost-engineers-stanford-study-4643/) (hint: they're on reddit instead, posting comments about how to get a job in the industry).As with all subreddits, this sub is a huge echo chamber, with people voting what they want to hear to the top. There are even periodic calls to ban or flair or otherwise discredit new grads or junior developers for being too pessimistic due to \"not having enough experience\", even though they are, by far, the largest part of the industry and the greatest indicator of it's health.Even today, anyone who dares complain about the state of the industry is often derided for being mediocre, told that \"there are no problem for goOd dEvelOpErs\" and fed other pointless misinformation. Most developers are somewhere around average. This average has risen a lot over the past ten years. If these people can't find jobs, the industry has a problem. It's really that simple. Tech isn't going to die as an industry, but macroeconomic trends mean that it's only going to become more competitive for developers.",

        "body": "I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation. I am not anti capitalist. I believe in markets. But capitalism only works when it is balanced. Capital should flow to where it creates value. When one player has too much it is like poker. They just buy every pot.",

Leetcode becomes the gateway through which developers must pass, similar to the CPA exams for accountants or the bar exam for lawyers. Regulation would take this de facto regulation away from leetcode and companies and make it the responsibility of an industry body. The pros would be never having to sit these leetcode test during interviews - if your accreditation is up to date then you are a software developer.

They are trying to kill OpenAI in a war of attrition and stagnate progress in the AI arms race so that they can catch up and inherit everything OpenAI would’ve been developing. To preface this, meta is notorious for poaching talent from competitors just to have them do nothing of consequence. They literally pay people to not work for their competitors. This happened a bunch during Covid in the metaverse era. It happened a bunch more before then as well when hiring was cheap. Hear me out. Meta is poaching all the top talent responsible for the creation of all the top of the line benchmark models and techniques from OpenAI. What do you do with all these people? I don’t legitimately believe that they will achieve anything more than what OpenAI and Google have already managed to achieve. I definitely don’t think their progress will be faster. There’s a limit to how many top people can work concurrently towards a goal. Not going to allege these people have an ego, but a kitchen full of chefs will not operate properly. You need some dishwashers and floor cleaners as well. All of these are chefs.Furthermore, $100M salary is literally more than most pro athletes will ever touch. I can only think that Meta anticipates these people will take the money and eventually retire. These outrageous salary figures don’t make sense for employees a corporate setting. Corporate budgets are lowkey designed so that people will keep working and spending money and work harder so they can spend more money. Paying that high of a salary in a few years is beyond effective to incentivize people to keep working. People will call it a career after they retire with handfuls of millions, let alone hundreds of millions.It might seem outlandish what I am alleging, but none of meta’s moves make sense without ulterior motives in my perspective. OpenAI is burning money at an alarming rate, still not profitable as a software company, and can’t keep researchers as they transition from a non-profit research org to a traditional corporate hierarchy. OpenAI is nothing without its researchers. This is a perfect time for Meta to try to accelerate OpenAI’s spiral into bankruptcy.TLDR; I am alleging that Zuck is paying insane salaries for this AI superteam to basically not work for his biggest foes (OpenAI and Google), and then basically have them retire or lay them off. Furthermore, he is ok if they don’t produce anything consequential because what he gains from his competitors dying (mainly OpenAI) is far beyond what he’s paying this superteam.",

You know, like a take home assignment supposed to take 1-2 hours. AFTER doing the assignment, I thought what the hell, I'll humor this AI thing. I started a new workspace, pasted the prompt to AI agent mode, and let it code away.What it created was not code I'd ever allow to pass code review.Did it work? Probably - I didn't try it. But my god it was awful. Abstraction that made zero sense. Repetition to tedium. Same function sometimes written 3 different ways. 10 files to do what should have arguably been done in 3. I binned it and I was thankful that at least my own work was better than that, even if not superb. If someone brought such code in a code review, they'd better be fresh out of university or I'd be genuinely worried about their ability to do their job.",

Modernizing these dinosaur companies in such a short timeline was a massive undertaking, made possible by near-zero interest rates and tax breaks on developer salaries. It created a tech hiring bubble.Many grads hired into FAANG during this time barely had a chance to gain real experience before being laid off. And what does that signal to recruiters? Fair or not, it suggests you were in the bottom performance tier and got cut. It’s rough but not necessarily your fault. You were supposed to have time to grow, learn, and move up or out. That chance was taken away.Now you're competing with other laid-off peers and fresh grads some of whom companies may prefer because they're seen as more malleable and come without the layoff baggage. And if you have under four years of experience, you're often not seen as experienced enough for mid-level roles, but no longer \"new\" enough for new grad positions either.",

They tell me they need something, I tell them I'll do my best and give my best estimate, and I leave at 5pm everyday.I've never been fired or dressed down for it. I have coworkers that can't say \"No\" and talk about how stressful the deadlines are. That stress is structural, it's not my problem.You want it done faster, than go find a better dev then me to do it faster. You can't find one? Oh well, maybe you should have expanded my team, or told the customer a realistic deadline, like I implored you to do repeatedly.",

I have seen huge boosts for some things like getting to write boiler plate and also one-shotting medium-complicated stuff that could have taken a long time to get right. Especially big speedup if you are not an expert at the language.BUT, I have also seen the opposite that it goes well in the beginning and then the LLM introduced bugs it cant find (even latest models and different models). You are then left with a huge body of unknown code you need to understand and find the bug in. Sometimes the bug can be complicated both to find and solve because the whole thing may not have been structured as you would have done it. Even if you are a senior developer you can become dragged into the mess, essentially becoming a 100 percent vibe coder. You get locked into the solutio space the LLM made, and it becomes harder to imagine how you might have done it. There's a temptation to go along and have the LLM fix its own mess rather than taking the plunge into it, creating an even bigger mess. That can waste a lot of time and leave a bad result. Just to be sure, I think LLM-generated code is not usually bad. Often it is very good about naming, error handling, best practices, reuse... Things many humans suck at. But when it gets stuck with something it can't solve it seems to mess the whole thing up again. So you really need to use it delicately. Have a feel for what it can do, when it is on the right track, when it is really understanding an issue and where it is merely guessing. Carefully review and roll back anything that doesnt work. Use dedicated sessions with minimal context for specific difficult problems, to help focus. But it is not easy - something the LLM might do well in one context, it can screw up in another (e.g. using wrong arguments etc. even though it clearly knows the right arguments in other contexts).When building larger systems of lasting value, build it all as you would yourself in smaller pieces one at a time and with unit testing... rather than hoping you can one-shot it all. Try to make good design decisions and it follow them, rather than the opposite. Review what it is doing. All this will eat into the benefit of course, but I still think there IS a net benefit, unlike examples of overuse which can be net negative.",

Even 5% reduction in headcount is catastrophic considering CS is one of the hottest majors in the world. AI coding may not solve every problem, but just know that there's a huge pool of jobs where people just make simple CRUD applications, and AI is good at solving this and thus reducing the headcount required to make this kind of applications in smaller companies. You may look down upon this kind of \"simple\" development jobs, and think if it's so easy to be solved by AI then those people deserve to be laid off, but it's still people losing their jobs.And people always make judgement about the future with the info they know now. Ecosystem evolves. Tools improve. You may not find AI useful now, but just remember the ecosystem is still in its infancy. It's not even been 5 years with AI coding yet. I wouldn't even think AI coding could be useful 3 years ago but trying out claude code has made me reconsider. It's not perfect, sure, but it's useful in many domains.",

The fact that it constantly has to make these \"AI doesn't do anything useful\" type of posts/comments betrays a real discomfort at the way software development is changing. It's essentially an attempt to convince itself that it won't change (e.g. copium).But technology is always changing. Even programming itself has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Computer programming literally used to be done on [punched cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). And then programming languages came along, and over decades, it became more like English and abstracted away to the point where we now have Python.I think we are seeing something similar with AI in software development. It will become literal natural language being fed into a processor (LLM) to write a program. From punch cards to pseudo-language to natural language sounds like a reasonable evolution of creating computer programs.My advice is to ignore both the AI hype and the AI naysayers who call it a \"grift\". There is a real utility for AI models. It won't be a perfect solution but it doesn't have to be perfect to make an impact. It just has to do enough.If you are worried about your job being taken over by AI, you can avoid that by learning how to use AI tools effectively. So maybe try Cursor or Claude Code. Or Windsurf. Whatever tool you like. Be a productive developer who can use AI effectively rather than disavowing AI and calling it a grift. You will be the one that companies will want to hire.",

It sure does help a lot and saves my time. I would probably need hours of Google search and multiple blogs to understand what ChatGPT teaches me in 30 mins.Just because AI cannot solve every programming problem, doesn't mean we need to completely dismiss its abilities.

Each program increment, we have a long ceremony where everyone participates to come up with a plan for the next increment—the next six sprints. It’s structured, and imperfect as far as Agile is concerned, but it does a decent job at helping us set expectations with our stakeholders and between teams.In this sense, our sprints are a means to track the work that needs to get done. And since there’s always more work, there’s always more sprints. If we ever don’t have more work and more sprints, we don’t have jobs anymore.In any sort of a scrum methodology, you want your sprints to be a specific length, as this will help you find metrics by which you can track the performance of your devs. Granted this *also* isn’t strictly Agile, because according to Agile, the main metric of worker productivity is working software. But managers will be managers and suits will want numbers, and when scrum is done right, it makes the job of delivering software under a manager’s scope less bad.I’ve never heard of “unlimited short sprints” before, and I have many questions and concerns.",

The junior market is globally extinct and every other listing requires some new set of knowledge and skills. Those of us who have wanted to do this for years have kinda gotten boned by LLMs and the actually insane number of normies who joined the CS trend lolatp theres more hope and fun in me and my friends making some friendslop on Steam in hopes of becoming a millionaire",

Be the best employee you can be, so managers there will take note of your work ethic and recommend you when you apply for internal transfers as they become available. You may have to start at the bottom and even go through temp services at first, but the idea is to start building a background for yourself. It may not pay much at first, but it will pay something. You spent four years working hard in college without being paid for it at all.ETA: I had not looked at your resume when I posted this. I have now and see you have a computer engineering degree and not a CS degree. You shouldn't have to start at the bottom. You should definitely try to apply for engineering related jobs of all kinds as well as finance, consulting, and management training roles in manufacturing, as those favor engineering majors and probably pay at least high five figures to start. In my opinion, you have the best bachelor's degree someone could have in terms of major.",

For example, I set a font cursor to like 4 in google docs and put a blank line of that size between my sections and each of my projects. I think it'll help you fill out the page and also make it more aesthetic. For what it's worth your resume looks pretty good content wise. Have you not gotten any interviews?

TheSo learn how to use AI more effectively for development so you have less debugging to do. Try practice using Cursor or Claude Code.Software development will inevitably change. It's the very nature of the work. This is a field that is constantly changing so you should always be learning. The historical trend is that programming becomes ever more human-readable. Programmers used to punch holes on a paper to write a program to feed it into a computer. And then UNIVAC and magnetic tape came along until punch cards were eventually entirely replaced. And now we have Python, one of the most human-readable languages out there.I believe programming is going through a similar paradigm. This is a good thing, as programming workflow is getting better and more human readable. The dream of programming since Grace Hopper has been \"what if we could program computers using human-readable language, not symbols and machine language?\" It's not a coincidence why Python is incredibly popular. Human readable is the end-state.",

I am not tolerating their crap.It depends on your situation, but if you meet with your lead, explain that you want to help clean things up, and start taking a first pass at PRs, he will love you.Fixing the contractors is a whole different game though. Do they have a boss that they all report to? Someone responsible for the whole group?I collect all of the examples of their garbage code and my peer reviews, then I send them to him. At first I was being kind and tolerant, but these people are making mistakes that literally no one with actual development skill should make.I've had many of them replaced already, and 90% of them are the same. I ended up with two decent contractors which try to keep the others in line.Their boss has actually made attempts to hold them accountable, and things have slowly improved.Anyway, yes, try to push for better code if possible. It is _painful_ to continue working with code that bad. Since your lead will likely support you in your effort, it might be worth it.",

I got hired at age 40 for my first job with no CS degree at the time(I've since completed it) and no experience in the industry.

Now you don't need to take several years to transition. In my case, I always assumed wrongly that those people with CS degrees were better than I was, but as I continued to become better and better and take code challenges and pass with \"professional level\" code grades, I started to believe that I was good enough and started applying to jobs. It took me a few interviews to land my first job but it's been like a rocket ship going straight up in my career ever since.",

That’s why they’re building more data centers. And nobody has a path to profitability. But this is more of a caution than a warning. When it becomes clear to the market that the difference between model generations is marginal, this will become a warning. We are seeing some signs of diminishing returns.

Self-taught and bootcamp will be mostly nonexistent things of the past. (sucks, because I'm self-taught with a BS in a different engineering degree—and would 100% prefer software, but that's the market)People will learn to code for all kinds of jobs because code in its most basic sense won't need software engineers to do it anymore thanks to AI. You'll only really need a fairly basic, 2-weeks worth of learning, to make what most 2.7GPA CS grads can do right now.But CS will become much more specialized requirements (like a real engineer). Roles that are for software engineers will be heavily leveraging the education you got in school, rather than just during the technical interview and then you never think about data structures and algorithms until the next interview.Operating systems, at-metal, embedded systems, extreme performance and reliability. These are the things you'll be making, rather than \"plz change button color to #FAAB1F\".Architects will drop off the face of the Earth, because EVERYONE in CS will need to be aware of and thinking about architecture from day 1. This will only be a dedicated role in the most extreme companies.It all ultimately depends on what the business majors decide though. If they decide that they have no reason to keep you around because LLMs are \"good enough for government work!\" then you won't have a job, even if the manager at the organization is being a complete dunce for thinking AI can do everything when it can't. Because often times, customers don't care if the software works ALL the time. They just want it to EVENTUALLY work.But if customers start saying, \"Ya know what, Facebook crashes so goddamn much, I'm done with it.\" Then they might start hiring people back again.\\#unionize will be your most important thing you can do over the next 5 years, but NOBODY will be willing to do it for a variety of incredibly stupid reasons.",

Then 6-12 months after they get hired, those red flags start surfacing. Not a lack of technical ability, but rather just being a *bad employee*.The value of referrals for a company is it's no longer a rando they're interviewing. It's someone that another employee, one they already like and trust, is saying is a good employee. It's not instantly getting you past the technical part of the interview or anything, that's why they still give leetcode interviews to referrals. It's just vouching for your character.All employees are able to refer people to SWE roles. John Doe in sales can refer a SWE. Betty Jane in marketing can refer a SWE.Don't hyper-focus on meeting people from tech. Focus on meeting *people*. Period.With that in mind, any hobby that involves more than 1 person. Join a social sports league, become a regular at your local dive bar, join a meetup group that tries out new restaurants every week, do *anything*.If you make genuine friends, your network will grow.",

When it comes to using AI as a coding assistant, it’s not as though you’re copying code you had no hand in creating, you’re just using the AI as a rubber duck/pair programmer to help you find more efficient solutions, help you figure out error messages, etc",

If you've been practicing software engineering, these kind of tests will be strangely difficult at the start, and it's going to feel SUPER weird. Like I also failed a test because I couldn't remember how to write a for loop. It doesn't mean you're bad at engineering, it just means you're a little rusty on the syntax for that specific test, and you got unlucky. You absolutely should not treat that as a problem with yourself: it literally happens all the time. Especially people who are more senior, has taken on more management roles, a lot of them will absolutely fail coding tests because the problems they've been dealing with a lot harder and a lot more important than FizzBuzz. That's why a lot of senior positions don't even ask simple coding tests: they'll either give a system design problem or a relatively complex live coding debugging challenge which is more representative of your actual work as a software engineer.",

But what matters it’s what you do after this failure. How do you bounce back? What do you do now that you see this deficit in your knowledge? Start taking Python basics courses in your free time. Tell your manager you want to improve, ask if they have any support measures in place for that to help you skill up for the next opportunity. Maybe they’ll pay for a coursera course or two- and if not, at least they’ll know you’re studying and learning from this. Build a project or two and put it on your GitHub. It’s weird you had to take an internal test, and I understand your confidence is shaken. But we all have weak spots in our experience. Devs don’t know everything all the time.

They have had no talk of layoffs or anything, it’s very stable and I’m so lucky. It’s in a very small town so there’s little competition but the town is based around research/bombs (I don’t work with those thankfully but it funds everything) so the work is really fascinating, we have contracts with some big names.

If any colleagues mentioned the possibility of switching to different projects or if there are upcoming ones that seem more hands-on, it’s reasonable to ask. Just frame it as an interest in growing your skills and contributing more technically, not as dissatisfaction. You could also ask around to get a sense of what other teams are working on.

It's still CS related so better than nothing, but you should aim for a job that uses traditional programming languages & SDLC. My advice is to try to get involved in any aspect of the project other than the GUI stuff. You say there's no SDLC but there must be a deployment process, testing, etc. you can get involved in these and may be able to write tools that integrate with the GUI instead of just clicking buttons. Maybe the GUI generates bad code sometimes and you have to tweak it or learn how it works under the hood. I don't believe what it generates is unreadable, you just don't know how to parse it.For interviews, minimize your experience with the GUI and talk up any actual coding you did.",

If you're able to work hard most days, you'll be miles ahead of others. If you're having trouble even reaching that, doing some over time ont he days when you can is a great strategy, both of my last jobs (both remote) had unwritten rules that if you needed some time off during work, no worries, just make it up when you can. You can definitely do it, and with remote work being more common in our industry than most it's probably even more possible than in other industries, just make sure you take care of yourself first, and most importantly, find a good company that isn't run by sociopathic assholes. Most places will do their best to accomodate as long as you're working hard elsewise.",

I've used it for that. No ads, small companies showup, companies with 0 postings show up. LinkedIn doesn't make it super obvious that's even an option, but it's here: [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies)Once I find a company, I go straight to that company's careers page to see the full picture of what they're hiring for. Pretty regularly the all-knowing LinkedIn job search algorithm shows me roles that aren't good fits for me, and hides ones that are good fits. When I'm on the company's website, I see *everything* they're hiring for., and can decide for myself what is/isn't a good fit.If they aren't hiring, I make a note of that, and I revisit them in a week. A company hiring 0 SWE's today, could literally be hiring 20 tomorrow. A lot of the job search is timing and luck, and LinkedIn is not good at that.Google is a great company search tool as well. \"Top X companies for WLB\", \"Up and coming companies in \\[city\\]\", \"Best companies in \\[industry\\]\", etc, etc, etc. There's tons of different search terms that turn up endless articles out there on Google that list tons companies. I've never run out. Don't limit your search to tech companies, don't try to inject terms about software, or tech stack. Focus on finding companies. You'll find most companies out there are hiring SWE's.That approach has always worked well for me.",

I've had way better luck going direct to company career pages and using some lesser-known job boards.A few alternatives that have worked for me:**Direct company searches:** Use Google with operators like `site:lever.co \"Product Manager\" London` or `site:greenhouse.io \"Software Engineer\" Remote`. Also try `site:workday.com`, `site:jobvite.com`, `site:smartrecruiters.com`, and `site:bamboohr.com`. These are the actual application systems companies use, so you're seeing jobs before they hit the big boards.**Recruiter hunting:** Find recruiters who specialize in your field on LinkedIn and connect directly. They often have unlisted roles.The real game-changer though is tailoring your applications properly. Most people just spray the same resume everywhere, but companies want to see you've actually read their posting. I doubled my interview rate once I started matching my experience with specific job requirements.Also check out Wellfound (formerly AngelList) and RemoteOK if you're open to startups or remote work.If you'd like I can share tools that can help with CV tailoring and job tracking. There are some decent options out there that make the whole process less painful.",

(Basically a to-apply queue) Keep it to like no more than 2 roles per company.Up to this point its all a mobile first process... So I can do it literally whenever. Then when I have some time I'll empty the queue (apply).The reason I put the very high filter is you don't want to apply to things where some random outlier keeps that company in the sample. When one person got $450k but everything else is around $120k... well that's obviously either:- Fake, or+ A special exception they madeThe real question is, \"what can I reasonably expect?\" and you can't use any other sites filter b/c TC can be insanely different from base.After applying I'll wait for the confirmation email, I then tag those as \"confirmed applications\".

        "body": "Reading through the comments, I'm going to take a different point of view from others because i think a lot of the comments are from those sitting atop their ivory tower looking down saying this is peasant wages and don't take the job. Funny enough, I am local to ATL too.To put it into context, i graduated 09 during the recession, similar hiring conditions as today. Took me 1 year to get my first tech job, 2 years to get my first development job. When i graduated, no one was hiring, not even for junior developers so it was rough. I took a glorified sys admin job as my first role for 30k/yr in 2010, first dev role was 40k/yr in 2011 and i thought i was living large.\\--What i'm about to say isn't advocating for the consulting firm, more adding insight to whats happening/what your seeing as all the comments you are getting are \"i wouldnt take it\" \"go work at starbucks\".So if this is your first exposure to consulting firms, it sounds like they are going to put you through a crash course of how to do things their way, which is fine, and pay you 300/week. At that point in time, they aren't making money off of you while you are \"on the bench\" so this is bench pay...some firms don't even pay for bench time so the fact that they pay anything is nice even though its laughable wages.The 200/week is literally paying you for not doing anything until you are placed with a firm. Again, they could just pay you nothing, but 100/week is insulting.The salary once your placed is also extremely low...for someone with experience. For a first time role, its really low, but you've got to start somewhere and in this market...i'd take whatever i can get. You aren't required to work at this place for the rest of your life, do 1 year and move on or do enough time until you find something else and move on.You aren't in a position where you have the luxury of saying \"yes ill work for you but not you\", you have no experience (if im wrong i apologize) so you've got to take what you can get in a market as terrible and competitive as this one.You can go the high and mighty route and say \"pay me what im worth\" but the fact is, in this market, people are desperate and someone will take that role if its not you.It sounds like you don't have any housing costs because your living with family, awesome, student loans...get on an income base repayment plan. If you make too low of a salary your payment will be 0 dollars. If you make enough but not enough to pay full amount maybe you'll pay 100-250/month...something like that...but you won't be paying 1000/month when your take home is 4k/month before taxes.My point is, the longer you are past graduation / out of the field, the harder its going to be to get into the field because your skills will be stale with no experience. Do you think companies want to hire the person who graduated in 2022 but still works at costco or the person who graduated in may of 2025? They are going to take the new grad 9/10 times.TLDR;Take the role, do the work, look for something else while your working and make a move if/when you can, you don't have to work here forever.",

        "body": "Four years is a significant gap, and Angular has evolved quite a bit since then, but your React experience actually works in your favor since both frameworks share similar concepts like component-based architecture, lifecycle methods, and state management patterns. The interviewer already knows about your timeline, so they're not expecting you to be an Angular expert tomorrow. Focus your cramming session on the major changes since Angular 2-4 era - things like standalone components, signals, the new control flow syntax, and how dependency injection has evolved. Don't try to memorize everything; instead, understand the core concepts and be ready to draw parallels to React when you get stuck.Your best strategy tomorrow is radical transparency combined with demonstrating your learning ability. When you hit a question you can't answer perfectly, explain how you'd approach it in React and ask about the Angular equivalent - this shows problem-solving skills and genuine curiosity. Emphasize that you've successfully made framework transitions before and that your recent React experience has kept you sharp on modern frontend practices. I'm on the team that made [AI interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed exactly for situations like this where you need help navigating tricky technical questions and thinking through answers when you're not 100% prepared.",

The hardest part was getting in front of people because you're competing against people who have used the language on their last job. If you live in a tech hub then my advice is to try getting in front of some people who can push your resume up or speak to staffing companies/recruiters. Interview-wise, some companies will give you language trivia and some will just want to see that you can solve a problem or write working code. There's also tons of companies that don't do DSA interviews. I'd also say to open yourself up to Java jobs. There's some arrogance sometimes from java engineers about c# but you should have a strong enough grasp of OOP to make the switch without much issue. If you are able to get interviews for java jobs just brush up on the fundamentals of java before the interview and try to steer the conversation to projects you've worked on and not language trivia",

If that number is less than 6 months, then I would work to aggressively save money until I had a 6 month emergency fund. If you already do, then2. Realize that an extra $45K a year means that you could spend that first year saving every extra dollar you made (if you're disciplined) and likely grow your emergency fund substantially - at which point a layoff is a lot less scary.3. Having said that, don't jump ship for a job you're not excited about. Most jobs have plenty of stuff you don't know about yet that you'll hate, so if your baseline going in is \"I already don't like this\", it's not going to get better.Be patient when in job hop mode.

I didn't study CS -- my degree was in Math -- but iirc, the BA option for math had less Math course requirements than the BS option. I think it may have had less physics requirements as well? I graduated a long time ago, so I am not completely sure. I assume a BA for CS probably has less CS requirements. Are you wanting to take less of these courses because you are trying to double major in something else that the BA will give you space for / possibly overlap on requirements? Getting a college degree takes a lot of time and money -- my personal opinion is that since you are spending all of the time and money, you may as well get the option that looks better on paper (which is probably the BS) unless you have a good reason not to. Having the BA won't stop you from having a career, and it may have no impact at all on your career, but since you are studying anyway, you may as well pick the option most likely to give you an edge. If you are just getting the 1 degree-- I would get the BS. If you are trying to double major to be a more rounded human and / or give you skills for alternative careers and getting a BA makes that possible - get the BA.",

Plenty of companies still need senior engineers who can build solid, reliable software without needing to sprinkle AI fairy dust on everything or architect for massive cloud scale. Your years of experience solving real problems and writing maintainable code matter way more than having the latest buzzwords on your resume. Companies hiring senior engineers want someone who can think through complex problems, mentor junior developers, and deliver quality software - skills you've been developing this whole time.That said, the market reality is that many job postings do mention cloud and AI, so having some basic familiarity won't hurt. You don't need expensive certifications or months of study though. Spend a weekend playing with AWS free tier, build a simple project, and you can honestly say you have hands-on experience. Same with AI tools - use GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT for a few coding tasks and you're ahead of many candidates. Focus more on leetcode since that's what actually determines if you pass the technical rounds. When tricky questions about technologies you haven't used come up in interviews, use [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to help navigate those situations and frame your transferable experience effectively - I'm on the team that built it specifically for moments when you need to confidently discuss areas outside your direct experience.",

I recommend sticking with CS if you like math because it dips into math theory, if you've already taken discrete math. Also look into a math minor, due to the math usually needed in CS concentrations you complete a lot of the requirements by default and all you need to do is take 1 or 2 more classes.Anyway just to stoke your curiosity, want to learn a little more math theory? what about solving questions like seeing how long your search method might take to search for a value in a linked list of idk 1023456889 items? That's my two cents though. Whatever you pick make sure you keep your mind open to learning.",

If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that. So if you want to learn mathematics in some sense to widen your perspective, a well thought out CS course load and maybe some reading on the weekend can definitely do that. CS isn't really that far mathematics if you look at it the right way.",

I’ve been struggling to land my first official internship and would really appreciate some honest feedback or guidance.**Quick background**:* Applied to \\~150 internships for Summer 2025 → mostly ghosted or rejected* Got 2–3 OAs from big companies (likely auto-sent) → no interviews* At that point, I had no work experience, and my projects were basic* Realized hiring managers probably discarded my resume instantly due to the empty experience sectionSince then:* Took on volunteer startup experience to build a decent work section* Completely revamped my résumé (got feedback from peers currently interning at Amazon and Meta)* Applied to another \\~150 roles for Fall 2025 → still no interviews* Tried cold-emailing + LinkedIn outreach to recruiters/engineers to ask for coffee chats and advice, but mostly get ghostedI'm not discouraged, but I’m stuck. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar position or has advice for getting that first foot in the door.What more can I do to stand out? What can I improve in my resume? Do the work experience section's bullet points look good enough?Also, feel free to roast my resume in general.

With the 2017 tax bill, you basically get 20% income untaxed off the top. And no such thing as free overtime. If I worked 43 hours, I billed 43 hours (well more like 47 because who's really keeping track right?).You have to do it smart though. Lots of shady subcontractor companies out there who pay like shit and take advantage of people. Stay away from any Indian sub contractors, they will fuck you.As for the lack of job security? No such thing anywhere. A W2 job can disappear tomorrow for anyone. It's a weird myth people have that having a \"real\" job means job security. Ask people fired from Microsoft how that works out.Also a really good thing about contracting is you stay out of all the political bullshit. You're there to do a job and that's it. You don't get dragged into the high school clique nonsense. You're above the fray.",

Many redditors confuse the two.There are 1099 contractors and W2 contractors. 1099 are like freelancers and much harder to do if you have no experience. Most companies don't hire 1099. W2 is working for a \"headshop\" or agency. Think WITCH acronym like Baines, McKinsey or Cognizant. You are an employee of that agency but contracted out to a company like Google/Apple. 60%++ of the workforce in Silicon Valley is this arrangement. There are stats out there to support this and in my view, it is more like 80%. W2 is a good way to get in the door. Period. Getting a W2 contract into Apple vs FTE Apple/Google/ whatever is a lot easier. The threshold for interview is easier as the headshop already vetted the contractors. I know people that go into the sidedoor this way. If you apply to Apple as a SWE, it is harder than applying to obscure department like recycling that needs someone to update their internal \"intranet\" private web site on how to recycle. That hiring manager isn't gonna leetcode you. Then you get your door in. And sometimes, maybe rarely depending who you ask, you have a chance of converting. But at least you get experience.I think it is fine for people starting out. The analogy is going to community college. You didn't get accepted to UC Berkeley? Take 2 years at a local community college then transfer.",

Rewriting your CV to be more filter-friendly is probably an easier place to start, though.At the end of the day, if you get a certification, that _still_ doesn't mean you have any professional experience in that language.What you need to be able to do is to back up the assertions you make on your CV. If you are confident you can (honestly) convince an interviewer that you will contribute at a specific level to their JavaScript project, then nothing stops you from asserting that on your CV without a certificate.A course might help you do that, or self-study, or a side project. But the people who are \"beating\" you for these roles are mostly not going to be referencing lots of certificates. They may be making some strong – even boastful – claims about their skills; that's what CVs are sort of for. You get through the initial filter based on what you claim is true, and you actually get hired based on whether you can back up those claims.

Does that mean you're a good SWE? All that communicates to me is that you started on a team that had a really shitty critical operation, and you were able to fix it as a normal part of your job. Does that make you a better SWE than someone who started on a team that actually had good code, following best practice, and didn't *need* any performance improvements? Does improving it by 90% because your app was so awful to begin with make you a better SWE than someone who improved it by 1% because their app was good to begin with?What does \"Saved the company $100k by simplifying the architecture\" communicate, other than the fact your employer had a really shitty architecture? What does \"improved the code base's unit test coverage to above 80%\" communicate other than you started on a team that didn't have enough test coverage?All metrics are that way. They don't say *anything* about you as a SWE. They speak to what the state of your team was when you joined. That's it. They don't describe your day to day, they don't describe your role, they don't describe anything about you other than *a single task you did during a single sprint*.Digging deeper into that, if you worked at a company for 3+ years, why in the world are you listing a single project you likely did in 1 or 2 sprints, when you have *a hundred* sprints under your belt? What happened during the other 98-99 sprints? You're listing anecdotes on your resume, not experience.Remove the resume aspect of this. If I aked you to summarize *your entire life* in 5 bullet points, what would you list? Would you refer to that one obscure anecdote where your sister tripped you and you fractured your elbow? Would you refer to that one time you stood up to your elementary school bully? Or would you give me extremely broad strokes of what you've done in your life over the course of 20+ years?The resume's no different. Your anecdotes, stories, projects, etc are all for the interview. They're for \"tell me about a time when\" questions.Your resume is for broad strokes to provide a clear and concise summary of the technologies you uesd, what your role consisted of, and any domain specific info worth nothing.I understand this advice is controversial, because *all* the advice I see on this subreddit suggests the exact opposite. But I fully believe a good resume should not contain a single KPI, impact, or metric, and I feel very passionately about that. I've personally *never* listed anything like that on my resume. Here I am 12 years later, never had issues finding a job with my metric-less resume.",

It's something we all do as a part of our daily job. Just because the team started at a low coverage doesn't make you a better unit test writer than someone who joined a team that was *already* at 80% coverage.My comment wasn't really saying metrics can be difficult to obtain, so we should ditch them. My comment was saying metrics are meaningless, even if you do obtain them.Focus on your role. You write unit tests. That's important. That's a part of your day to day work activities, that describes what you've regularly done for 3+ years. That makes you better than a SWE that does not write unit tests.Whereas going from X% to Y% in unit test coverage doesn't really mean anything. That percentage increase, while certainly an achievement, was only possible because your team had bad coverage to begin with. It's only possible because your team wasn't following best practices from the get go. Because you joined a team that started out bad doesn't say anything about your abilities as a SWE. You write unit tests, I write unit tests. We're the same. The metric/impact isn't relevant in the context of a resume.",

It takes time to absorb knowledge and I did a quick glance at curriculum and didn't see much in the way of fundamentals (OS/Networking/Security/etc.)I went to a (lower) T25 school for CS and honestly, felt like it wouldn't have made much a difference compared to a state school. It was essentially a math degree and my real knowledge came from self-study. Most of the students were not particularly bright either, I actually find the non-degree people better technically in general.I don't come from money, but unless you're going to like a real top tier school like MIT, Mellon or a top tier Ivy I would just go to a state school. You'll come out with much less debt, get the degree to check that HR screen box, and you'll have time to absorb the information, but also get a more rounded education.",

Phone screen by recruiter, zoom call with hiring manager, zoom tech exercise, 2.5 hour in person part tech part meeting the team. I'm expecting an offer today or tomorrow. Only annoyance was the ask for references. Current job doesn't know I'm on the way out and my prior employer where I worked for over 20 years has this in their employee manual:>EMPLOYMENT REFERENCES >All requests for references for current Team Members or for former Team Members who have left must be forwarded to Human Resources for response. No other supervisor or Team Member is authorized to provide references for current or former Team Members. In accordance with state law, may disclose information about current or former Team Members' job performance when requested by Team Members or prospective employers, but will not provide job references that are intended to mislead, offered in bad faith or tainted by malice. So far I've been unable to get a 'direct manager' reference. However the new prospective job 'requested references', didn't say they require them. I provided a skip/side manager as well as a local business leader whom I've worked with in a volunteering capacity for 3 or so years now.Pretty sure that'll do..",
