Offshoring always ticks up when the business starts dealing with uncertainty in the market or some sort of economic downturn. Many of my previous companies used at least a small cohort of offshore resources and some even had entire teams that were offshored. Eventually the result becomes the same. Either the offshore quality drops due to conditions in their own country deteriorating or individual resource quality drops enough that something triggers a management 5-Alarm fire drill trying to fix offshores output. It’s a boom and bust cycle.The weirdest situation a company of mine dealt with (at least that I was privy to) was we had a group of offshore resources that worked at a shared office location in their country. The main analyst freaked out, suddenly quit, formed his own company, and poached the entire staff of his original team leaving only the “manager” for that team. The guy pretended everything was fine for 2 weeks and told nobody that he was soloing all this work. During that two weeks, he fucked up some report for management that made the corporate metrics look absolutely dogshit which triggered an analytics all hands meeting to figure out what was happening. Offshore “manager” joined remotely and when leadership asked to see the rest of the team, he just said,” what team? They all quit. It’s just me.” The next month or so the analysts across the company were helping do interviews to get more onshore talent.",

        "body": "Let me take a crack at it with a handful of examples:**First Normal Form (1NF): No Crowded Rows**Every row should be unique, and you can't stuff multiple rows into one cell.* **Rule:** Each cell in a table should have only one value.* **Example:** Let's say you have a table of your friends and their favorite colors.**Messy (Not 1NF):** | Name | Favorite Colors | | :---- | :------------------- | | Alex | Blue, Green | | Bella | Pink |To make this 1NF, you give each favorite color its own row:**Organized (1NF):** | Name | Favorite Color | | :---- | :------------- | | Alex | Blue | | Alex | Green | | Bella | Pink |Now, every field in your table has just one piece of information.**Second Normal Form (2NF): Everything in its Right Place**This rule is for tables that have a composite key, i.e. made of more than one part. It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.* **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.* **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.**Messy (Not 2NF):** | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping | | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- | | Sam | Pepperoni | Olives | | Mia | Cheese | Pineapple | | Sam | Veggie | Olives |The problem here is that the \"Favorite Topping\" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day. To fix this, we can split the table into two:**Organized (2NF):****Orders Table:** | Customer | Pizza Type | | :------- | :--------- | | Sam | Pepperoni | | Mia | Cheese | | Sam | Veggie |**Customers Table:** | Customer | Favorite Topping | | :------- | :--------------- | | Sam | Olives | | Mia | Pineapple |Now, the \"Favorite Topping\" is in a table all about the customers.### **Third Normal Form (3NF): No Secret Information Hiding**This is about making sure that the information in your table is only about the main topic (the key) and not about other things in the same table.* **Rule:** Be in 2NF and have no transitive dependencies (in other words, each cell on the row should *only* depend on the key, not on other cells)* **Example:** Let's look at a table about your favorite Disney characters. We'll throw in their first movie appearance for good measure.**Messy (Not 3NF):** | Character | Movie | Movie's Director | | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- | | Buzz Lightyear | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Woody | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Elsa | Frozen | Chris Buck |Here, the \"Movie's Director\" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`. If the director changes, you'd have to update it for every character in that movie. So, we split it up:**Organized (3NF):****Characters Table:** | Character | Movie | | :---------------- | :---------- | | Buzz Lightyear | Toy Story | | Woody | Toy Story | | Elsa | Frozen |**Movies Table:** | Movie | Director | | :-------- | :------------ | | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Frozen | Chris Buck |Now, the director is in the \"Movies\" table, which makes more sense.",

E.g. you have the patient name, age, gender, etc. The doctor's age, name, gender, specialty, license number, job title, etc. You could store all this data in one table, but it's not very efficient and it may end up causing issues later. Imagine what that table looks like, every time person A sees a doctor, you're writing to the database all the data about Person A, their name, their age, their gender etc. so if person A has 100 encounters, you're storing their gender 100 times. Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. Instead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor. Then you just give each record an ID and \"point\" to those records when you want to reference them from somewhere else in the database. It also has the benefit of conceptually distinguishing the different entities in the universe of data.",

For 3NF, consider how it would be difficult to understand the relationship between the PK and the transitive dependency. If you looked at the data of a table with a transitive dependency (TD), you wouldn't necessarily be able to understand how the TD column relates to the rest of the columns.

If you kept that information in one table you'd have to update every single order that customer entered. Now imagine you stored user data in other tables. You'd have to change multiple rows of multiple tables. What if another dev made a take that stored user data like that that you didn't know about? You'd have inconsistent data.f you keep the orders with a reference to the user table, you'd only have to change one field in one table and the references wouldn't have to be changed.

Besides, sometimes a \"test\" is just a trivial function checking whether you can pipe two or three PySpark functions.If you are creating a transformation library, sure, do you unit testing. But if we are talking about business-related code with modular transformations, my take is that not every of them need an associated test.",

Databricks, for example, runs circles around it for real heavy lifting.

DLT is the crown jewel of ADB currently, and it isn’t for everyone. Whilst the features it brings are very handy (schema evolution, expectations, etc.), it won’t meet everyone’s requirements.

Issues: * Fundamentally it's flat files (usually Delta Parquet) on a datalake. i.e. a big data solution that can handle very large data volumes in theory, and that splits out compute & storage, so that one can have wildly variable compute. Cool if you need it, 90% of places don't, and now you've lost all the advantages of a relational db. This is the same issue that Databricks has tho, when it's used in inappropriate situations. * As far as big data solutions go...it's no Databricks. It's several years out from being ready for production, seemingly. Even the consults who implement it, if you know them, seem to think it's still a janky beta product.",

Just keeping going and learning, you can’t magically know everything you need to know at once, like Neo in the Matrix (though that would be nice… opens eyes, “I know Kubernetes”). Do spend the time to learn git though. That is life changing. And always keep an eye out for what best practices are in any given situation, but balance it with real world pragmatism. That’s an art, and really hard to figure out. So anyway, best of luck, and you’re not a fraud :)",

Your bosses don’t want to see you fail - if for no other reason than because that makes them look dumb. Use that to your advantage. If you are not interested in the subject and don’t want to do it, then figure out what pieces you are interested in and lean into those. Then highlight the importance of those and tell your boss that you’re more interested in the other X stuff (figure out a way to make it seem higher value) and you’d like to find a way to step back from the other stuff you’re being asked to take on. Chances are this is being dumped on you because they think you can handle it, and if you can’t then they need to get you support.

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc. But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt. It would have been far easier to have actual engineers build the data pipelines. * In most of the data engineering teams I'm on we also build the platform anyway: all the reusable code, libraries, extra tooling for deploying models, quality-control checks on the data, etc, etc.",

However, that isn't the end of the world at a company like AWS which focuses a lot on working in AWS toolsets. You will learn a lot of the tools on the job if you dedicate the effort and time to it.SQL knowledge will get you by on a large portion of the job but for the specific things they're calling out like legacy ML code is likely going to be in Python or another language. You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. I suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least. Example: build an ETL pipeline to pull data from a public API, shape it, and write it to a database. Then build a simple dashboard for it",

If it's just implementation details for ongoing sprint, then it can be done asynchronously via slack or Jira.So it's not impossible to have \"Self aggrandizing meetings with the higher-ups\", but more likely, it's to vehicle the right decisions at critical times. Been with my current firm for 5 months as a lead architect, and honestly it's better to take time to officialize and rereview certain decisions than to scrap 2 months of dev because \"oops, forgot to include the right people in the input and decision process\".",

They can continue to work as normal if you don't \"drop in\".4) We've also had similar success with \"co-working\" hours a couple times a week which is just a zoom that anyone can drop into and chat or just sit and work but be available for others to ping. If the manager is smart they will ask their Seniors/Tech leaders/wannabe Seniors to make themselves available during this time as part of their demonstration of leadership.Both 3 and 4 are intended to help with avoiding constant interruptions for go-to folks so they can get into their flow state, while still helping those who need it by setting aside time to make themselves available for technical help / mentoring / problem solving / etc",

You need to guide them effectively so the team isn’t overly dependent on you. otherwise you become a liability, not an asset.2. **Drive Technical Improvements** – Being “senior” isn’t just about doing tasks. Anyone can “just do the work,” even outsourced labor. What sets you apart is exploring new technologies and processes, then implementing those that bring value. This continuous improvement is what justifies senior/lead pay over time.You might reach a lower-tier senior role without these skills, but it’s rare and you won’t progress further (lead/principal) without them.The one real exception: niche legacy tech experts. If you master something like AS400 or FORTRAN, you can stay purely technical and still command high pay maintaining old systems.",

Though there are more options these days, and I haven't taken a close look at Soda Core or a few others.What mine typically involve are: * Engine that runs queries organized in database/schema/model folders * Each folder has a manifest file that identifies all queries to be run, including references to shared queries that aren't in the folder, so I don't have to keep writing queries for uniqueness, foreign keys, etc. * Queries are templated to support database, schema, partition and other row filtering arguments, sometimes more if they're shared queries * Sometimes also enable the engine to run python programs * Engine's CLI arguments allows filtering which checks to run: by priority, by type (ex: check, reconciliation, etc), allows filtering which data to run against by giving it partitioning values, etc. * Sometimes this ends up wired into our infrastructure, so it can run automatically, and log to our log consolidation service, send alerts via pagerduty, etc.It takes a while to get everything just right, but it's not terrible. And a lot of the investment in time goes into writing the checks - which would have to be done using any opensource or commercial product I'd go with anyway.",

Pandera doesn't give you that, I think, because it doesn't give you guardrails and scaffolding for consistent use. If I were doing one-off validation, absolutely. but if I were worried about 1000 pipelines I wouldn't want to have dozens of people doing Pandera slightly differently or teams that did dqa different from one another. [soda.io](http://soda.io) or datakitchen might feel less like a pia. I feel you re: NoSql. I had a dynamoDb setup recently that had data quality problems. we did what you said, basically -- created a Pg database, pushed the data there and used Sql tests there.

It does full pulls daily and use hash comparisons to handle updated/new/deleted records. For issues I ran into, schema drift was a big one because my employer loves adding fields but snowflakes schema evolution made it super easy to deal with and track when new columns get added.

Other possible requirements include: * Ability to ignore some columns for the delta * Ability to dedupe records * Ability to generate common dimensional fields: primary_key & primary_key_version, as well as valid_from and valid_to timestamps * Ability to generate five output files: inserts, deletes, update_old, updates_new, and samesI wrote a command line delta program years ago that does all this for csv files. It's in python, so not the fastest, but I did benchmark it with billion row files. I think it took about 15 minutes, but don't recall of the top of my head.With data in a relational database(-ish), I'd probably create the diff using SQL, write the output to tables (except for the Sames), then generate the ids while appending/updating to the original input table. This is based on the assumption that 99+% of your data is the same each time you run this.",

You have to be disciplined about \"coasting,\" but most of us need to spend time operating well below capacity to avoid burnout* Data teams functioning as support can struggle for visibility, which means career opportunities can be limitedStartup thoughts:* Product data roles are relatively rare. I've turned down a few product-based roles and work with product engineers. My impression is that your incentives are very different from internal-facing work* It's probably going to be sink-or-swim. They wouldn't have extended an offer if they didn't think you could hack it, but if you like more support, it's probably not a good fit* There's likely very little structure around teams, advancement, and growth. It's very common for everyone to believe in \"the mission,\" and your major target is less about titles and salary and more about driving the company to IPO / acquisition, so your equity is worth something* If you actually get to work on streaming / near-realtime, that experience is very valuable to a smaller number of employers. Data warehousing / batch processing is much more widely applicableHow I'd think about the decision:* Are you OK with being tossed in the deep end and figuring things out? That's likely the expectation at the startup* Are you comfortable with more than just doing heads-down work? Startups generally require you to be more cross-functional / collaborative since you may not have mature processes (product management, team leads, etc.)* Are you capable of managing burnout? This can be a problem at both places, but your manager at the corpo probably has more experience identifying and heading it off (lowering workload, encouraging vacation / holiday, etc.)* Is working on the latest tech really important to you? If it is, the startup is a no brainer. If you're OK with learning more enduring patterns on an older stack, this is less of a differentiating factor",

I get why Company A feels safe—it’s stable, has nice people, and you’d be in a predictable environment—but if your goal is long-term career growth and building skills that transfer globally, B is where it’s at.Here’s why:1. **Modern, cloud-native stack:** Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift + Spark + Python/Scala + real-time streaming is what the market is moving toward. Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it’s much more “legacy enterprise” skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact—stuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn’t scream “can build product-grade systems.”3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it’s stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that’s exactly where you learn the most. You’ll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines—these are highly in-demand skills.4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.If you want a chill ride and don’t care about moving internationally or building the “modern data engineer” skillset, A is fine. But for leveling up, B is the one that actually sets you up for the future.Basically: stress now → way more options later. That’s how I see it.",

        "body": "I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar. This meant a couple things. You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned). When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table. In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time). Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy. That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts. To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago). The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza). These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.BTW: one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system. While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred. By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash. But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)apologies for rambling on.",

There are a few advantages:* Independent processing: You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. * Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios. There are some disadvantages such as increasing storage of the key, risk of collisions, and being less human-readable.",

Advantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence 1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. 2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users—who are simply analyzing metrics—can't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. 3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. 4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",

So make sure you have some of those user types in your discovery meetings, because too often I've seen them skipped and not able to provide feedback and the catalog turns into shelfware that does nothing but extract metadata from your systems.Like everyone else in the thread has said, open metadata is rather popular and can be self hosted. Alation can get really expensive as you tend to pay per connector IIRC. Atlan has a lot of integrations, but I don't recall if you can host it.

I see plenty of code based ETL orchastration (Dagster, Airflow etc) but less GUI options unless I'm missing something key. The issue I have there is that for bigger places, code based works fine, they can have dedicated DE teams but smaller businesses and onw man band operations definitely get a benefit from simpler to use GUI based tools. I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.One thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.Your package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. Outside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations. Don't think I saw anything for changing the write destination engine type so if I missed that then ignore me. Good work on it though!",

GUI tools might be inefficient and not great at scale but the simplicity and ease of use for non-data professionals can be very helpful in a lot of business uses. Efficiency and scaling aren't that important when the data you work with is <500k rows per source per month but its worth having something to remove the manual task of loading 10+ datasets. Less worth it when things like Dagster take the process and complicate it to hell with lots of new concepts that mean nothing to a business user. And yeah a python script with pandas and sqlalchemy could do it but that's assuming that the team have a python dev. Lot of data teams are basically SQL and their BI tool of choice only. This is where a simple GUI tool shines. They know the data, they know how they need to get it and where to get it but the how might as well be magic currently but a GUI tool to pick, load to staging and then do a series of basic cleaning steps to get it ready and save that as a flow they can schedule allows them a lot more capability and lets them get a lot more value from their data.",

Like I said, I was dealing with tens of thousands of simulation files regularly on hardware that would make you cry. This volume is nothing for current systems.Second. You'll probably have to deal with files regardless. Most simulation software (I'm assuming it's a simulation, Markov chain analysis, probably?) dumps to files, though maybe yours can dump to a db. Doesn't matter.What I would do is let them save everything to a bucket/blob/network drive/whatever then have your warehouse pick it up from there and stuff into a database. You can easily add the filename and other metadata during ingest and then you can serve it up to them nicely from the database. Everyone is happy.As for executing over 30 days, that's a single Python/bash/CLI of your choice script. Since it's an optimisation problem, I'm guessing you're setting up hyper parameters for each run. You can do that with a CSV and a short script to pick up the values for each run.Don't over complicate it. This is a pretty simple exercise.",

Now we have a dedicated snowflake schema for each external integration so permissions are handled at the schema level rather than table level and all I have to do is create secure views when they request more. Another benefit that I have seen is that when you share via snowflake you tend to have more data that can augment the raw platform data. Imagine something like hubspot customer data being joined with product sales numbers. You suddenly have much more valuable context which leads to better insight signals.",

Write each user into SEPARATE ordered extents into S3.Step 3: Run a single historical spark job to rewrite the data into historical logs for each user in the order the tables were designed in. Select where id > 0 && id < step1.table_id_seq. Upload those to each users extents.All queries are now embarrassingly parallel, and you control the data, not Snowflake.If you are under 100TB you can do this in under a week with a handful of spot instances, S3 and just one engineer (yourself).These cloud vendors are literally selling shuffle debt as a service due to SQL destroying physical locality at ingest. Your cost will balloon and you will never get true real time unless you fix the locality problem at ingest.DM me if you want help (free of charge, I have nothing to sell you unlike these cloud vendors :thumbs_down:).",

        "body": "Informatica mappings are actually simple model to model transforms. There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.Thankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.While this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly. Check out [this overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVITxb-HSPQ&t=20s) to see if this is the right thing for you. Hope this helps.",

That way BI teams and analysts are able to query data that could reside across many systems. They then add on additional benefits like governance, optimization, cataloging, and the like. In my opinion their current downside is the number of integrations they support compared to their competitors. Semantic layers really only work if they are the sole entry point, which is only possible if they can sit on top of all the company’s data sources.",

Backend: tables only on the share. Each user gets a local front end with linked tables. Turn on record-level locking, no datasheet edits, and keep persistent connections. Disable Offline Files on the share and use wired only. Nightly copy + compact/repair on a backup, not the live file.\\- Python GUI: wrap inserts/updates in explicit transactions, commit, and log the inserted PKs. Add a CreatedAt and a soft-delete flag to avoid hard deletes. Check for cascade deletes and filters that might hide “missing” rows.\\- Better: move the backend to SQL Server Express or Postgres on a small VM, link via ODBC so Access keeps working. Add a rowversion/updated\\_at for optimistic concurrency. Point the GUI to an API and keep the search hitting a read-only replica (SQLite/Parquet export hourly).I’ve used Supabase and Hasura for quick APIs; DreamFactory helped when we needed REST over legacy DBs with RBAC so clients never touched the database directly.Bottom line: put writes behind a server DB/API and keep Access as just a front end.",

Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)I would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",

This is the story of how search has evolved - how we've been trying to solve the problem of finding the right information at the right time for millennia.We start our story before the written record and race through key developments: library catalogs in the Library of Alexandria, the birth of metadata, the Mundaneum's paper-based search engine, the statistical revolution of TF-IDF, and the vector space model from 50 years ago that lay the groundwork for today's AI embeddings.We'll see how modern tech like transformers and vector databases are just the latest chapter in a very long story, and where I think we're headed with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where it comes full circle to that human experience of asking a librarian a question and getting a real answer.",

The first push tends to be implementing the documentation and catalogging best practices, which allows teams to get the early benefits of a catalog. The challenge comes post-implementation where all of these stuff need to be maintained. This means that after every change to the tables, every new column, every change in team/domain structures, the governance steps need to be kept up-to-date. Someone needs to update lineage manually, change data quality rules, and make this a part of their development process.My suggestion after implementing a couple of these types of solutions would be to either have a very clear post-implementation maintanence process mapped out, or to look for solutions that would already integrate the governance within the rest of the development lifecycle.",

We felt it was at risk of becoming \"shelfware\" if we couldn't automate the upkeep.We then evaluated a few opensource catalogs, including Amundsen and DataHub, but ultimately, our specific needs took us in another direction. A huge chunk of our data is unstructured and lives in on prem resources. The challenge wasn't just cataloging a cloud data warehouse, but getting a handle on this massive, distributed file environment.We ended up using the integrated catalog that comes with our storage platform, DeepSpace storage. It was a good fit because its core job is to manage all of our on prem file storage. Since DeepSpace is already tracking every file for its tiering and archival purposes. There's no drift between the catalog and the storage because the catalog is the storage's metadata. Our resources lean onprom though, we may have gone a different way if we were primarily in the cloud.",

Keep six template variants and route based on a field value.\\- For scale/nightly batches: export via Data Loader or Fivetran into SQL/Snowflake, then have Excel read from that source; I’ve used Power Automate and Zapier for quick file generation, and DreamFactory when staging Salesforce data in SQL to expose clean REST endpoints for Power Query.Net: make Salesforce the source of truth and let templates populate automatically instead of retyping.",

Technical: having snapshots that go a considerable time back will lead you to using up a lot of storage (well, that really depends on the table specifications - number of rows, columns, data types etc.). Sometimes even having snapshots up to 2 weeks back may be too much. Every snapshot will have data files associated to it and I expect that running this query to do trending with snapshotted data will be quite slow after awhile. Eventually you will have to expire your old snapshots to optimize the table and you will lose data useful for trending.Practical/human: writing a query that does trending will be quite messy. You do not want to do trending on data that is \"hidden\" inside some snapshots that do not show up in the simple SELECT *. At the end of th day you should write queries that are simple to communicate to the business and could easily be taken over by other team members if needed. So to keep things simpler you should indeed go towards SCD2. Let me know if you have any questions!",

If I didn’t have a handful of structured courses to follow that explained programming concepts and language fundamentals through some simple projects, I would have given up. Not everyone learns best through code-along projects but they do have value for me. Obviously the quality of the instructor and code they write can lead you to good practices or bad practices so that’s important to keep in mind. If I jumped right into an idea I would’ve absolutely gotten overwhelmed, lost, confused, and put together a shitty project. It’s important to note that you’re early projects aren’t going to be great but you can save yourself a lot of time by knowing what a project structure should actually look like. I’ve been working for a few years now but I owe a lot of my knowledge to educators that took the time to explain concepts clearly. Building a few code along projects taught me a lot about how things are wired together and that was the most effective method of learning for me personally. I regularly reference old code from past projects when trying to do something I know I’ve done before. Having a couple of big project that follow good coding practices at the beginning helped a lot.",

It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)But with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...Work on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey. It builds momentum, confidence and skill so you know what to employ .Your first iteration will suck ass. The first 1000 line of legitimate code will suck ass. Don't try to be perfect. It is better to have something that can be recorded as progress and going from there",

Without a degree you have none of the business background, no math, no probability, no stats, no physics, no engineering, no logic, no years of proofs, no architecture, no operating systems, no systems programming, no threading, nothing.It's my job to tutor all kinds of people. I've been watching people self-study vs university students, and the holes in their learning is immense. All they do is WebDev and LeetCode. They think they know Big O but they don't. They don't know that it's worst case and why worst case is the one that matters because they don't know what p and np are. They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding \"DSA\" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took \"useless\" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.Meanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.Everyone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off. It's ridiculous that people actually think there's nothing to be learned from four years of education, but here we are, defending it again from Reddit.Here's a link for anyone who wants to self-learn: [https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)",

It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality. Not only that, there is also a chain of responsability behind hiring, because hiring is expensive. If the hired person turns out to be someone incapable of doing productive things, some people will start to look at who hired him. Which hiring manager do you think has the chance of defending himself : - \"But look, the person had a diploma for X, Y years of experience, and done projects with Z, how could have I guessed that it was all bogus\" - \"Okay, the person had no diploma and no experience, but they all learnt this by themselve, did all these projects, and had a good vibe\" The first one, you can't really blame. The second one, it's obvious the decision to hire was risky and subjective so you can really blame him for that. A recruiter doesn't want to get bitten back if their hiree doesn't perform well in the future, so they play it safe. They don't owe you anything, they don't have any reason to take a risk with their career to help you.",

That means publishing scientific papers. You don't need a degree for this, but if you want to study it at this level, you will also be reading a lot of scientific papers as well.If you want to be an engineer, like an actual engineer that requires certifications and to be able to code well enough that you're applying engineering principles to every project. If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen. Like it still has to work somehow even if AWS or Azure servers go down. Multiple redudancies and all that.If you simply want to code, you're a developer that mainly works n consumer grade apps. You don't need a degree or even necessarily certifications. You just need a somewhat robust portfolio, personal and volunteer projects, getting your apps into app stores, etc. IF things break down, people are merely inconvenienced. Don't listen to all these others about a CS degree being meaningless. Even if you never work in industry, the benefits of being able to understand parts of society at a funademental level is valuable in and of itself....kind of like how a philosophy degree is a great investment in that it teaches you critical thinking skills",

Like I had tons of friends in college who liked the idea of making software, working from home or making good money, but few of them liked reading docs, trial and error, and learning DSAs. Not saying you 100% have to like all these things, but if you are lacking, you better do them like you love them. Here’s what you need to do, even if you don’t like it.Leetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. Pick a language, and “master it”. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it’s the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. You like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don’t know what you like. I’ll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don’t stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. Since it seems you’re still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. If you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn’t make it and then go execute. Stop saying you like the idea and go become one. Cheers, if you want more specific advice regarding what to do let me know. Best of luck.",

Even a project that is poorly executed *but executed at all,* does wonders for both for your learning *and* for the resume.One I have not tried yet but I bet would be a fabulous standout: a *debugging AI slop code* project. So here would be the steps:- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application. You want it small to ensure you can fight it all by yourself, but make sure the AI doesn’t actually just knock it out of the park in one shot; if so, try again until you get something sufficiently buggy.- Debug the code. You might think that this needs to be fancy, but I cannot stress enough how basic this is. It can literally be just notes to yourself with a date explaining your thoughts. I wager it could say things like: “So, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods….” Etc- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",

Knowing how to open the file, write text to it, and then close the file.At a senior level, you know how to do all of that second nature and you've learned a few things, so now you also know that your string probably should have been converted to bytes because of project requirements and that depending on the language, you may have needed to flush the buffer before closing the file.You learn the patterns. You learn what the OPERATING SYSTEM requires and therefore you know that the language has to implement it in some manner, it's just a matter of finding the syntax.Yes it gets easier, but it's not because you're familiar with the languages, but you're familiar with what they MUST be capable of if you just know what to look for.",

Nobody (paying client or end user) cares what language you use or how clever your code is (or pretty) 3. The only value of code and programming is ultimately what benefit or service it provides Now… there are good reasons why many people would argue with me about those three points—and they’d be wrong :) There a great reasons, from certain points of view, that all of the three things above matter—but please go into all of this keeping in mind that the result (of what you code) have value (usefulness) the code, by itself never does",

It's a useless metric for actually working on code.Imagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.Unless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just \"see\" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.The first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.> I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediatelyThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs. It's for translating doing something into a series of steps that a complete moron (i.e. a computer) can follow and not missing anything in the process. It won't help you with planning ahead. You don't want to plan your programs ahead, neither as a beginner nor as a veteran. It's nigh impossibly hard and the reason why Agile exists.",

No one here has done any of these fire-and-forget cloud apps, and I haven't had a single interviewee with such a portfolio. The problem nowadays is more that nearly everything that one person can do in a reasonable amount of time is already out there as a neatly packaged tutorial, so it's not easy to distinguish whether the person has actually done that themselves or not. It helps, but it's not as indicative as it used to be.> On the job market, you are not a “programmer” anymore. You are someone who is familiar with a very narrow set of tools, and need to market yourself accordingly.Sadly true, but it's a bit more nuanced. There are tons of coders out there, so if you have an open position, there is no reason to not take someone already familiar with the needed stack - and in turn people who don't market themselves as that won't register. But beyond that we absolutely want people with generalised programming skill and not just framework-kiddies.",

For instance, you pick up your first book and learn how to do variable assignment, and print, input, and if statements in some language. I would then spend a month writing text games in Python using only those components. And then I would learn about loops and arrays and write a bunch of better games.

Set a time limit for your project, then once done or time has run out reflect on what you wanted to achieve, what you did achieve, what problems you encountered, how you solved them and what you would do different next time, afterwards, move on to the next project. Repeat until you feel confident to tackle bigger projects.A note on AI, having someone or something constantly tell you solutions to problems, diminished learning results. Your brain just gets lazy and used to it. This isn't even unique to AI, this is just how learning works, reddit can do the same if people wouldn't be so openly hostile towards people asking for help with minor issues. Instead tell your preferred AI that it should never just give you the solution and just analyze your code and point out where an issue might be. Then attempt to solve it by yourself.

It is in part because children aren't self-conscious about trying to talk - they'll just say shit and if they say it wrong, whatever, an adult will correct them. Whereas adults will be hesitant to even try to speak until they're sure they'll say the right thing, which slows learning right now.You really do need to work from the bottom up mastering the basics first. You would not believe the number of students who have convinced themselves they can write production level code, but if you put them in front of a whiteboard and ask them to code a method to remove an item from an array and return a reference to the new, smaller array or something simple like that - they just *cannot do it*.

I feel like AI has made a lot of people think that the struggle of learning should be avoided or is not necessary just because it makes learning look effortless by giving you the explanation and answer, but the struggle is still necessary. Struggle is learning in itself, don't be scared of it. Because I already went through all the struggle and wanting to pull my hair out because my code wasn't running, now I don't even let it affect me because I already know it's normal and that it's just a sign that I have to try harder. If everytime you struggle the first thing you do is go to ChatGPT because it's too difficult then you're not gonna get very far. Being stuck is normal and it is a part of learning, embrace it and accept it and try to solve the problem by yourself.",

        "body": "There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. The idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then \"attach\" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health. All of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of \"system\" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.Typically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like \"has components x y and z, but not a\". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.This is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.This roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.htmlRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_SystemThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).Here are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:C++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratchC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/C# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/Here's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",

But I suspect almost all modern compilers do, it may even be the case that the people who are disagreeing on this simply have a 20 year age gap.I don’t even think you have to increase the optimization level in clang or gcc to make both of these examples dissolve into nothing. (Meaning purely in-place source substitutions, before even generating target assembly.)You could test it by looking at the compiled output of a really tiny program either locally on your machine, or on something like Godbolt’s compiler explorer.",

It's going to replace - at a text level - whatever it finds, *before* that gets sent to the compiler. So if you do that define, any time it sees \"foo\" it will replace that with the number \"1\". It will be like your source file literally says \"1\" wherever it encounters \"foo\", regardless of where that is.If you are worried about the difference in memory usage between a `const int` and a `#define`, you are almost certainly doing unnecessary optimizations.",

This is discussed in The Art of Programming Style by Pike. However for other types like double, it is safer to use 'const'. Now, in terms of efficiency, there is virtually no difference because the compiler will just inline it for both. But with #define it will just put in whatever you typed, say 1.1 but with const it will put '1.1d0', this is just a short hand for 1.1000000000....This kind of thing matters for precision calculations. If you use only 1.1, the compiler will automatically choose the lowest precision for you, so it is 1.100000. Now, you may be wondering how about > \\#define N (1.1d0)The problem can be shown with this:> printf(\"%f\", N)This will work if N is 1.1 but it will fail when N is 1.1d0. The reason is because when it is 1.1, the C standard automatically casts it as float by detecting it as a decimal number. But it doesn't know how to handle 1.1d0 in this context. In fact most functions don't even do casting for you. However with a 'const' the standard knows exactly what to do and printf's templating macro code knows how to pick the right printf to be linked into your program.",

Write automated tests to interact with the ui and simulate what a user would do. Forget the stuff like devops and webhooks and whatever. Just focus on replicating what you do now. Doing this will help you build basic JavaScript skills. That right now should be your focus - just being able to do stuff in the language, it’s a run before you can walk kind of thing. Then you can start going deeper. There’s plenty of courses out there on every subject so I’d say pick a small area and focus on that. As a QA you probably don’t need to know more than the basics about docker and kubernetes, but things like APIs and webhooks could help you test more. So pick like a small subject area then expand. As an example you want to learn about APIs so break that down, let’s say you have a JSON rest api. Ok first look at the definition of rest. Then at api endpoints, each has a http verb and a route and will return a http response code. You don’t need to know it by heart but look at what response codes could be returned, look at which verb each route uses and understand why - then you can build test cases to hit each one, like what data gets you a 200 ok response vs a 400 error response and how can you make each happen. Keep a notebook with everything you hear that you’re not sure about and Google. And ask your team too, a good team will be happy to help you learn more.",

APIs are how systems are made to be interacted with, think the buttons on the remote of your TV. *A Philosophy of Software Design* makes some interesting points about API design, but I think you'll need to progress a bit more before going into it.Webhooks are just a call back address for inter-service communication, the only trip up here is how more complex ones are implemented in code, but I don't think this should worry you at this point - the gist of it is \"Here's what I want, call me back on this number when you have it\".For the rest, there's no specific order you have to learn things in, nor is there an expectation that you will instantly develop a deep understanding of any of these topics, as long as you understand how they fit together. Might as well focus on learning things that will help you be better at automation and save the deep dives for later1. TCP/IP, REST + others, if working in web2. Database basics, lock contention, ACID (if your work has you interacting/testing databases in any way)3. What does it mean to actually deploy something, what's going on behind the scenes (ssh, cp, configs, env vars)4. The basics of your language of choice, most common data structures (arrays, lists, maps)5. Once you're comfortable writing some code in the language you'll be using, go into whatever testing framework you'll be using (selenium?)No one knows everything, so I suggest focusing on things directly related to what you want to do and then slowly expand your knowledge out of professional curiosity and/or to upskill.",

Postman is perfect to start withIgnore Kubernetes, Docker, all that DevOps stuff for now.

Can't remember if it's on Steam, though...Shenzen I/O - Has you build some gadgets - programming is in an Assembly-like language. IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).TIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.While true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.Grey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.Then there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.Another good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.Back in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...It's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",

If your URL contained a space, your `os.system` call wouldn't work correctly because URL would be split into two arguments. It'll also need to pop open a command prompt window if you're using pythonw.Stick with one of either `Popen` or `subprocess.run`. Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions. Using `Popen` directly is useful if you don't want the function to block while the program is running, so it's useful for opening a program for the user that will stay open for some indeterminate amount of time, like opening a text editor, the calculator, etc. (if this is your intention, do NOT use Popen in a with statement, just call it directly.) `subprocess.run` is probably what you usually want for command line utilities because you'll actually be able to see the results. There is also `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call`, these are okay but the docs describe them as an \"older API\" meant for use by \"existing code,\" so I'd probably just stick to `subprocess.run` for anything new*also, `Popen` and `subprocess.run` will let you pass strings as the first argument like you can with `os.system`. Don't do this, because then you're back to that same problem you get with `os.system`. Stick to passing them sequences like tuples or lists, and don't use them with `shell=True`.If you feel like you have to hit the shell, you probably can work around it. One time I thought I had to hit the shell was for a cross platform way to run the \"default program\" for a file, via `start` on Windows, `open` on Mac, or `xdg-open` on Linux. However, the latter two are actual binaries and not shell commands so they can be opened via `Popen`, while the former has a dedicated Python function, `os.startfile`, so in all cases it is possible to avoid hitting the shell.",

[emcc.py](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/emcc.py) from that repo is a pretty good example.As for interactive executables, I can only mumble vaguely something about \"piping streams\" and \"forks\", I'm not sure what the best approach is there.Some executables also communicate via files in tricky ways.If I control both the caller and call-ed executables, I'll pretty often just use good ol' HTTP requests.

Then, the answer is rather \"no\" but not a 100% no, maybe a 50% one.It is generally helpful to learn to implement those algorithms yourself as it will deepen your understanding of them and give you programming practice.> Will you directly use this skill in professional work?Again a rather \"no\"You will most likely resort to the built in Data Structures and Algorithms of the language/libraries you are using and rarely have to implement your own versions, but there still can be cases where you need to.> Will you need Algorithms for Interviews?Unfortunately, yes. As currently LeetCode style questions are dominating the interview process, you will absolutely need solid DSA skills to even pass the interview to potentially get your foot in the door for a job.One thing to not forget is: programming is generally all about DSA. Knowing what to use when to use it and its advantages and disadvantages is absolutely essential.Knowing how to write your own implementation of standard DSA, however, isn't essential.",

Though, some interviewers seem to be looking for that skill for whatever reason.But in an interview situation, it's really hard to tell. Who knows, if I'm the interviewer and I have a fishy feeling that you're not \"up to snuff\" as it were, maybe I'll throw you a random algorithm question and see how you respond. And if you don't get the job, who knows, maybe you'll go off to Twitter or X or something and whine about how company Y wants people to memorize algorithms or something. Really? I don't think it's that simple in an interview situation.Personally I think you should be able to program an implementation of something, given a description of an algorithm. All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The \"Algorithms\" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.For example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. Though even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort. Also how likely is it that you would know which algorithms guarantee stability and which ones don't?",

Intuition is knowledge you don't actively think about. It's implied. It's inherent to your thinking. It silently informs you and influences you. If you watch a master of his craft, any craft, you will see they make it look so easy. They don't \"just know\" better, it's not merely muscle memory, it's a career of lessons learned, and decisions made, and fundamental concepts wholly and completely understood.So a master developer can get cracking at code in an instant, whereas you might have to spend a lot more time trying to understand the problem and design a solution. The master can do it because all that understanding and design work? Yeah, they already did that - same as you, even for this very problem today, they just did the work 20 years ago...So you learn this stuff not because anyone gives a shit whether you can actually implement a binary tree in an interview. RARELY do we implement primitive and fundamental data structures ourselves.

The problem isn't that you are not talented / smart enough - the problem is that computers are a giant clusterfuck of abstractions upon abstractions, and understanding what the hell is going on down to the electrical level takes a lot of time and a lot of learning, hence why coding might look & feel like \"magic\".TL;DR - If you want to *actually* become proficient, then start teaching yourself more about how computers work.

Learning a language is easy but learning how to program is hard the same way learning to use a saw is easy but being a great wood worker takes time. The language is your tool. Being a competent programmer is to change how you think. Which is something anyone can learn. You just have to be patient and be open minded and it will eventually start clicking. Break every problem down to tiny micro steps and tackle each one. Want to move a character? Well how do i read what button to input? How do I set the velocity of the character? How do I animate it? Three little problems from one problem that sounded small in the first place. Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress as a professional programmer i still look at my code and think I can do better. Body builders are never entirely happy with their figure and still want more muscle growth. The same thing happens in our brain with code. Even very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pokémon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will clickAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance. If you have a hard time addressing this i do recommend seeking help and learning to be more comfortable in your own head and getting some confidence",

OS gives programs so many things to do on a computer, like: Reading/writing to files, creating folders Arguments for one time data sharing for invoking a command/process Textual data sharing through environment variables Streams of data for getting input, writing to output and error streams. Sockets for local or outside network communications Queues, shared memory, pipes for inter process communication Heap memory allocation, loading dynamic libraries Registry for storing various settings (Windows only)Creating window and controls for displaying content on a rectangular area of a screen. Getting input from input devices like mouse/keyboard/gamepads. Access to hardware accelerated graphics through shared libraries. And many many things that you don't even know of. When you know the tools that OS provides you see the big picture. And.....good brain in the head helps immensely understanding all of that lol",

So, I’ll answer from the perspective of being proficient.My experience is that becoming proficient in c++ takes longer than it does in Python. A lot of this is that c++ is a lower level language. You need to understand concepts that simply don’t exist in Python. You need to understand pointers and pointer arithmetic. You need a better understanding of memory management. Stack vs heap. Call by reference vs value. So many more. Sure, Python has its own things like decorators, descriptors, etc, but you can be proficient without a full understanding of them.Expect learning C++ to involve some core concepts, not just language semantics and common libraries. I wouldn’t say it’s “hard”, but it’s not a weekend project.",

        "body": "Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says \"I don't know, Professor Smith might know though.\" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says \"I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know.\" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says \"I don't know, try Professor Jones.\" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.That's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately \"Dan? He's on page 56.\" You ask, astonished: \"You just memorized that???\" Dr. Bryant: \"Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \\* 1 \\* 14 is 56.\"4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: \"Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore.\" Bryant goes \"Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!\"5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. \"But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?\" Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.This is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the \"bucket\" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.\"OK, why not make it ordered then?\" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it. So if you're doing a lot of insertions compared to lookups, that may not be ideal.",

So a hash table is faster than a linked list only when there are enough entries that looking outside the cache will be slower. On a cpu, that’s about 100 to 1000 items. Tye point is that a linked list gets slower the more items you have. So, for that matter, does a binary tree. A hash table takes the same amount of time no matter how many items you have. So if you need to process or look up a few million items, hash tables are hard to beat. Plus, who cares about performance when you’ve only got a few hundred item? It’s going to be fast no matter what. Just use a hash table anyway.",

A modern CPU will get through 1000 additions much, much faster than 10 levels of pointer chasing.The reason is that if you're waiting for one pointer to load you can't even start following the next pointer. Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.There just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.If a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.Other points in favor of linked lists* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them. It's difficult to get these chimera data structures to work correctly, the simplicity of LLs helps* sometimes you really need O(1) worst case insertion time (if so you also need to prevent page faults)",

Before compilation you can allocate as much memory in it as you think the program will need for its entire lifetime, like few megabytes (mebibytes). But you need to manage memory inside that buffer by yourself and what if you need more memory during the execution of the program ? Here comes the heap memory that OS manages by itself, you just request memory allocation to it. The C/C++ runtime code now manages the heap memory regions that it controls, you just call \"malloc/free\" in C or \"new/delete\" in C++ and they return a \"pointer\" to this new memory pages. It's just a number to that memory address. Now you can refer to data outside memory constrained \".data\" section and have dynamic data allocations. Each memory section have pages of memory allocated to them, so they all may have access attributes associated with them. \".data\" section is readable, writable. \".text\" code section is readable, executable. So you can't ovetwrite the code that your program is dependent on. C/C++ without understanding OS concepts would be hard to understand cause many APIs rely on understanding them.",

Since u are already halfway through this bootcamp program, I personally think u should finish it.Put AI out of your mind for now. Some people may not be able to afford using AI for many years. Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.Besides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?Perhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.I understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public. Try to think of longer-term projects for your skills. I wish you the best and am happy that u have already accomplished so much. Hopefully u will at least keep me posted on whether or not u decide to continue the bootcamp program.",

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.Though the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future. So from that perspective, there's still a value to learning your craft.As for the market, there's nothing I can say but I feel for you- I hope openings for juniors open up again. I think the decision to stop hiring juniors is incredibly short sighted, but it is what it is. Do your best to network and turn non-leads into leads. Listen to whatever career progression framework your bootcamp offers.As for burnout, take a break if you can- try and think about this from a long-term perspective and try and enjoy learning and making things for their own sake. That's what this career is about at the end of the day and there's nothing wrong with giving yourself space to reconnect with that. Good luck.",

Stuff that you’d find on a blog or YouTube video where you have to assume the viewer knows next to nothing and will stay for 5 minutes.Anything more complicated than that, and AI breaks down. Writes way more code than you need to solve a problem, solves the wrong problem, solves the right problem in the wrong way. It’s important to be concerned about it in the “I should know about this” sense. It’s currently not important to be concerned about it in the “this is going to change my whole career trajectory” sense.At present, AI is really just a better version of intellisense, the automatic code completion. Serves the same function, and that tech has been around for a decade.You can never hurt yourself by having more skills. Stick with it, but I think it’s important to have a source of intrinsic motivation: some project you want to do for you. Maybe that means making a website for one of your hobbies/interests, but being able to be proud to say you built the whole site from scratch. That not only feels good, but it is something you can put on your resume too.It’s probably too soon to think of switching career paths altogether.

Plus W3 schools pretty much had every creative thing covered - so much so that our tutors if they got stuck copied and pasted W3 school code.I kinda burnt out and now restarted with a passion with Python. At the end of the day, AI can walk the walk but you as a professional should know what AI has written and then use your creativity to tweak the code to better suit your needs. An inexperienced coder would not be able to keep re-iterating to an AI how to work a code into a website without breaking it but you with the knowledge will know how to.Whenever AI gets brought into conversation re: industry/ jobs, I always bring up the fact that once Microsoft brought in Word and WordArt - suddenly small businesses didn't need to hire/train to be graphic designers as their basic logos, menus, business cards, etc could just be done via Word. Did it do the job - yes! Would a graphic designer do an infinitely better job than a generic WordArt - Of Course! Just because you gave a tool to layperson, doesn't mean it'll cut out a specialist",

Plenty documentation, plenty tutorials, and a very welcoming community.If you want to venture outside game development, look into *Python* as it is a great starter language, high in demand, very versatile, multi purpose. In that case, start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\"Hard\" is debatable. Programming *languages* by themselves aren't \"hard\" or \"easy\". *Programming* is hard - but by creating things with Scratch you've basically already covered that base. Even though Scratch appears as childish, block based system, it is still real programming. It has every single fundamental concept of programming, only that it is presented in a graphical manner. If you are competent programming in Scratch, you have the programming *logic* down. Now, you only need to learn the vocabulary and grammar of textual programming languages (which is actually the easier part of learning programming).",

Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.Since commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.Branches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.Remotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEADMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.Reverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.Stashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.Other concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.Git is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.Hopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",

They're just doing different things.For example: take a look at what a [\"full adder\"](https://www.electrical4u.com/binary-adder-half-and-full-adder/) logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.But if all you care about is the *result* of the addition, you could get that with a single `ADD` instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level. If you just want to model the *desired* behavior of your CPU, you can just write code that emulates what each CPU instruction is *supposed* to do, and that emulation can be much faster. But the emulator won't tell you whether or not your logic-gate-level design actually works properly.",

A few followups if that’s alright; First note: some of my questions may seem irritatingly dumb and I apologize for that as I’ve just begun my journey into learning programming and computer architecture:>It's not really a \"flaw\" in Logisim, it's just that doing a low-level simulation of logic gates is inherently more expensive than a high-level emulation of the same architecture. They're just doing different things.Q1) When speaking of “higher level emulation” vs “low level”, what do these terms imply?>For example: take a look at what a \"full adder\" logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.>If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, Q2)What do you mean by “iterate over each of these logic gates” (I know what iterate means but not exactly sure what it mean to iterate over a single logic gate)?>fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.>But if all you care about is the result of the addition, you could get that with a single ADD instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.Q3)So the emulator he uses is emulating the logism circuit right? So doesn’t that mean the emulator at some level and up moving thru the same amount of logic gates?>In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level. If you just want to model the desired behavior of your CPU, you can just write code that emulates what each CPU instruction is supposed to do, and that emulation can be much faster. But the emulator won't tell you whether or not your logic-gate-level design actually works properly.Q4) Ah ok sort of understanding like 1/3rd of the way now…so both are emulators - one is on logism, one is a “higher level”, but why does this emulator get to skip over all of the logic gates that logism musnt? Q5) And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?Q6) a final conceptual question if it’s OK; when does an emulator no longer get to be considered an emulator if it’s not actually proving your system “works” since it’s skipping tons of steps that actually need to be tested to be able to say your original circuit works? Are some emulators so far removed that we shouldn’t call them emulators? Like this one? Apparently the guy used the emulator to make it 1000x faster!!! There is no way the emulator acts at all like the logism right?Thank you so so much kind genius.",

Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.To thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.You have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.A real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one \"instruction\" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)Let's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by \"iterate\". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.If instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)I'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.> And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?They're not \"skipped over\". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.----If you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goalSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.Once you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the \"vernacular\"** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.Oftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not \"tutorial hell\".People who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",

You get 80% of the benefit from just picking up heavy shit and putting it back down, and 18% of the remaining 20% from doing the easiest optimizations (alternating which muscle groups are worked + watching your calories).The obvious thing everyone can agree on but gets lost in the argument is that it's pointless to focus on your diet, get perfect sleep, and buy the right supplements... but never actually go to the gym.We can (and do!) argue on and on about if it's optimal to build projects, watch presentations from industry professionals, focus on languages versus abstract CS ideas, learn through integration or building from scratch, if you should focus on learning functional and declarative paradigms, philosophies of state management, keeping up with industry standards...... and the advice of \"go *practice*\" gets lost.Go. Try to build something. It'll be bad. You'll probably get completely stuck at some point. Research how other people solved the problem. Watch some tech talks or YouTubers, read a blog, whatever. Find a library that does the thing. Try again. It'll be better. Still bad. Rinse and repeat.

Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.Here are some things you can try in order:- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic \"Hello World\")- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)- Pushing the button resets the counter.- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).Everything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.Once you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",

Don't jump from one language to another just because you think you understood the basics. Use the basics to build projects that get more complex from project to project.

Don’t use AI to write your new Ansible code, it will stick better in your mind if you do it yourself, the more you write the same piece of code the better it will stick.

As far as understanding code bases, is there no one left with knowledge of the code? That is a bad situation and I urge you while you are learning to code base to create some documentation on what you find. It’s obviously going to be some sort of living document since you are figuring it out but maybe it will help the next person assuming you don’t reach your goals. Unfortunately context around why things are the way they are is some of the most important stuff, if there is a commit history you should be able to start there to see feature additions, which can give you a good idea of what does what. What’s your official role? Deployment stuff might be more on devops side (and I’m not even sure most people would agree) but honestly job titles are kind of meaningless and working on infrastructure/deployment is part of software engineering.

        "body": "This question is so extremely common nowadays that a simple search through the subreddit would have given you more than plenty answers.When you get an assignment, don't directly start programming. **Plan** before program. Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.Code is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.Just *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.Build your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.Programming is lifelong learning. It takes months to build up basic competence, years to obtain some proficiency and a lifetime for expertise.-----About your task:> i had to create a license plate checker which would output valid or invalid.Well, not much information you give here, but still:What do you need for your program?+ You need some form of getting the license plate - user input+ you need a place to store the license plate - variable+ There are some rules that you need to follow (which you haven't told - so, I'm blind guessing) + most likely, you will need to extract each character from the license plate - you will need a way to split the entered data and a store for it - maybe an array - could just as well be that you only need to loop over each character + you need to perform some action with the character - maybe some summing, multiplication, etc. + At the end, you will get some checksum or some indication+ you will need to verify that indication (conditional)+ you need to output valid or invalidThat's the way to break down a problem. The more detailed you do it, the easier it will be to implement the code.-----I'll leave some comment from a [former, similar post](https://redd.it/1mhcd21) here:Honestly, most of it is down to practice. Use sites like [Exercism](https://exercism.org) for ample practice exercises.There are several books commonly recommended:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V.

If you want to do pixel art, aseprite is a very good app for that (on computer), I prefer drawing on ipad so I use pixsquare on it, you can export to the aseprite format so it works great. If you want just 2d art, Krita on pc is a free drawing program that works well, I'm mostly on ipad so procreate is what I often use. If you want 3d, blender is free and great, it has a good community and a lot of tutorials, it can be a bit hard to learn but it's a nice skill to have.",

If you read about [the semantics of a semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29) you'll see that the behavior doesn't depend on what that initial value was. So at the implementation level, the current value is all that matters, and the OS doesn't even bother to remember the initial value.The only purpose of the semaphore is to prevent the *current* value of the semaphore from going negative, by blocking when the value would otherwise drop below zero. Aside from that, it's up to the application programmer to decide what the semaphore's value \"means\" and to increment/decrement it correctly.See, for instance, the \"producer-consumer\" example on the Wikipedia page I linked. In that example, you use two semaphores tracking two \"resources\": `fullCount` for the number of items in the queue, and `emptyCount` for the number of available slots in the queue. If the queue is initially empty, then the `fullCount` semaphore is initialized to zero, but its value can later increase when items are added to the queue. It doesn't make sense to limit the semaphore to its initial value, because it would prevent use cases like this.If there is only a single resource being managed then it's up to the application to ensure that it never increments the semaphore above 1.",

I just used an LLM for the front end (I really don’t care for front end development or JavaScript), so I was able to build the backend quickly. I had an endpoint to read JSON from a POST request body, do some work on it (data manipulation, hashing, etc.), make a new request to another API I had that would respond with random data, then I would respond back to the client with the modified payload and the other server’s data. I then added authentication, a database to store previous requests, and slowly started adding more pieces to it. I learned a lot about how a system works and how to design a program larger than that of “return the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence”. Try looking for free APIs and see if that sparks any ideas",

Experiment by making one change, see what it does to the output, then revert that change and change something else.

Will companies give up their entire global engineering department, or just start shifting more work outside of the US?Not to mention I wonder how much of an impact it would have on remote work to prevent hiring people outside the country. An employer that’s remote first can get the best candidates not only in the US, but also places like Canada or the EU. If that’s just US, then remote work loses some of its benefits.For off shoring in India, I don’t know that 25% is enough to matter. For the above scenarios, it’s too much to be practical.",

I do have a name brand employer, but I am a bootcamp grad with a BA from a known California party UC, not known for CS like Stanford… First year was causal and brushing up on DAS. The start of this year I went all in learning and studying. Now compared to a year ago it is night and day in my interview knowledge. I’m in a similar boat of being full stack but I lean front end. I’ve applied for close to 500 at least. I’ve gotten close to 100 interviews and then cut it in half for each phase after that. None with referral. I’ve gotten to the final Just within this year I’ve gotten 4 offers. C1, Apple and Walmart and a startup. Why didn’t I take them? It didn’t meet my requirements which was a higher position with slight higher TC or at least 20% higher TC. Yes it’s been a struggle but most of those no offers were on me and lack of preparedness. There’s such a large bell curve in learning what I didn’t learn for those that have a CS degree. Looking back at my failures if I had the knowledge now then I would have easily gotten 15+ offers since I know where I fell short. Are there more applicants than jobs? Yes. Are we cooked? Not yet. I’m in the final round of 4/8 interviews I have lined up now and half way point for the other 4. Knocking on wood I’m hoping this is it. If anyone wants me to post a full journey post mortem like this and lmk. My advice for those that are still looking. Be prepared, you may get one shot a quarter and you don’t want to miss it. Once you have your new job work on features that will make you look great. I’ve had a friend with same years of experience and similar background but can’t get interviews because they became complacent with doing little to no meaningful work and now that they became unemployed they have little to show for it on their background.Edit: if you’re going to reac out please say more than just “Hey”. Bare minimum is not going to cut it when reaching out to someone either on here or when trying to get an interview.",

As a person who has been in the military, construction, CNC machining and now currently a truck driver I started getting into computer science 3 years ago and will graduate with a BA next December. By the time I started AI wasn't out just yet and I was learning Python, C++ and Java. Let me just tell you how disheartening it is now that most of my simple ideas and projects are capable of being done by a prompt rather than the hours it takes to study, understand the material, research libraries and cross reference other methods in order to create some code. I fear that the kind of jobs I wanted to have won't exist by the time I get out there. I enjoy trucking but there is no industry that AI will not touch. My employer has implemented a camera in our trucks that already use AI and it's capable of detecting our eye movement to know if we are distracted, drowsy, and tracks our following distance, speed, braking, turning and any other metric you could imagine to gauge the competency of a truck driver. Then gives us a score and compares us to other drivers in the fleet. I dislike it but it's the future. I hope you find the job you are looking for but this is the end of an era and the birth of something we cannot stop nor fathom the implications and what will be on the other side of this. I wish you well.",

Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide \"okay this person is incompetent\" and finally fire him.So hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).This is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???This would be news to me.",

I said screw it and used AI to make it ATS friendly, and wow it looks terrible compared to what it was before but now I have been getting way more hits and it parses a lot better on non quick apply applications.",

I can only imagine that nvidia's culture is already contaminated by the same toxic people who are ruining all the other big tech companies right now.Similarly- Oracle got mocked to high hell and back. Their stock blew up. You'll never guess what company people is asking for referrals for now. As for where I am? I love it.

The work is impactful, the pay isn't the highest but it's decent. 50hrs isn't uncommon, but it also doesn't feel like 50hrs. Management is flexible with how we spend our time, understanding, does what they can do in order for us to get things done.I won't say a goddamn thing where I am because I don't want us to be the next target for vultures.If you want a hint- look at the companies that AREN'T culturally popular in tech.

I'm not saying my kids are 100% the reason why I'm not getting any better and focusing 100% of my work time towards coding and my career in general and being able to do overtime as and when and taking time on the weekend to learn new skills etc.But yeah, trying to do any professional job and improve in it whilst raising kids and trying to be a parent, a GOOD parent, whilst being there for sick kids and not being as work and feeling like you are letting the team down. The fear of the online and offline world judging your every parenting skills and then having the fear of being lambasted because you make 1 mistake out of a million times when your kids usually don't \"misbehave\", its tough.All I can say is, yes being a good developer who can code and everything is fantastic to have. Have you had one to ones with your seniors or bosses recently? One thing that came out of a meeting I had with my boss, when I said I was shocked at how good the new hires were compared to me (3-4 yoe) and my boss remarked that if I felt that way, what the company saw was that I am a really good person to have in meetings, in projects, who could understand the scope needed for a project, who could bridge communication between stakeholders and developers, and people just felt knew that I was like a go to person when there was help needed etc.If you can, do your best and find ways and opportunities to develop your coding skills. Your soft skills from something as simple as communication between teams, don't neglect or underestimate these either, these can also help you stand out as a senior dev or higher",

        "body": "Some companies have a formal process to graduate engineers to senior and beyond as individual technical contributors. But I feel like many go based mostly on feel and perception. If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.I agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.I saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.Just a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.The AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some \"dumb\" questions we all have.I will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time. Don't let people make you think you have to give up a decent work life balance.",

        "body": "I've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned. **As an Ambitious Overachiever:** From my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects. In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** On the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**Something I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**It is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.*****Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**I took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker. I found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.****Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. **Summary/takeaway:**Brute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman. Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). My practical recommendations are 2 things1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. One anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve",

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. There are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.Second is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",

Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.It doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.Regarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn’t teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens. Best of luck to you!",

Your manager probably believed his team lead just because he had no reason not to. But now as soon as actual evidence was required, he's realizing the team lead is scapegoating you. Given all this, I would be surprised if he isn't massively pissed at the team lead now and you are probably mostly fine. If I were the manager, I would not believe anything. The team lead says about you from here on out and I don't think the team lead has a ton of discretion on your career trajectory. That being said, it would be totally understandable if you're not comfortable and look for a new job. I guess the big question is how much of this is company culture, and how much is one jerk?",

I lack formal education and am in a rural LCOL area. Especially reading this sub I have developed even more extreme imposter syndrome and anxiety about losing the job and never finding another tech job bc of competition and industry trends. who knows I could get exited from the industry before I’m fully ready to leave anyway, so I need prepare and plan accordinglyI have personal traits that lead me to burn out, and that’s in any job I will ever have so I need to address that if I’m going to last doing anything. My current plan is to stick it out another 7-10 years in tech. If I can do that, without lifestyle creep, I will pay my house off and be 100% debt free and will have been able to sock away a decent bit of cash toward retirement and toward investments I could potentially draw some interest off of. THEN, I can work literally whatever job I want. I will need to bring in some nominal standard income but I could certainly stand to lose my tech level wage. It’s the plan that feels most plausible and future proof both from an industry perspective and just how long I can put up with this career field. Im pretty tired of it My advice to fellow burnouts, make a goal and an exit plan. Having the goal for me has been extremely motivating in the short term, and you can always continue working in it after if you have a change of heart. Just know if you exit, weigh the re-entry cost if you think it’s at ALL possible you’d ever want to come back.",

I sprinted away from law to keep my sanity and got lucky enough to group up with 2 friends from work/school to cofound a legal tech startup—no, it's not an LLM wrapper—that, while still early, is showing promise as we start to get demos in a few smaller firms' hands. I'm handling a lot of the software architecting/engineering/review and do a fair amount of QA since I have an (limited) inside perspective of what lawyers like/need. Now, as I approach 30 I feel happier than many of my friends in other fields, especially law/medicine where everyone I know seems absolutely fucking miserable. I typically work about 50 hours a week, have ownership in something I believe in, and still have plenty of time to raid on FF14, play tennis, or read. However, many of the people I know in tech also seem happy, and I caution people in the field against assuming the grass will always be greener on the other side. For example, a lot of the complaints people on this Reddit often echo—annoying/incompetent managers, unreasonable deadlines, leadership with no vision, etc.—are present in virtually every industry; I got lucky with the partners and senior associated I worked under in law, but others at my law firm would routinely get screamed at by partners for minor issues.",

        "body": "I live in LES ( a neighborhood in NYC). 120k sounds good very good entry level and fintech is a good space to be. Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub. Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.Its very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.What life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.The biggest cost in NYC is rent. Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national priceTo give oyu some idea what prices are like. Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier3. Fast Casual lunch 15 to 20$4. Street food from a take out only operation 8 to 12$.5. Specialty Coffee from a cafe (6$ - 7$ before tax)6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter 40 to 80$ per person. You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.7. Alcohol 6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars. NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street, 10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.The other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.TLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance. You can basically live your best life.",

The work I do is already algorithmic in nature so studying leetcode isn’t really worthwhile since I’m basically doing it at work.

Then I go back and implement the solution, try to do it from memory from the video and then come back to the same problem the next day. System design questions I paid for hellointerview premium, and used the guided practice. I’d go through the practice first and obviously it wouldn’t be perfect, but afterwards I’d read the solution to see where I went wrong and why. The why here is important since tradeoffs is a big talking point in SD interviews. I think I ended up doing around 75-80 leetcode questions before stopping since i got some offers. I know it’s not a lot but I think going through neetcode courses gave me a solid enough base to figure out questions during interviews, although I only ended up doing like 3 interviews. Luckily only was asked one or two hard questions",

That said, the roles only requiring a Secret or below generally don’t pay all that well and aren’t the greatest for career advancement in general. The real money and interesting work in defense is in the roles requiring a TS/SCI clearance or above which is much more involved and expensive to obtain as a new civilian applicant than a Secret or lower clearance even as a naturalized citizen with a squeaky clean record so many companies absolutely will not sponsor new TS/SCI applications and require you to have your clearance already finalized and active to even consider you for any TS/SCI+ roles they recruit for.",

Those will not be AI’ed away for a long while. Having options is good.It’s gonna be rough but take any job you can to get some experience and get past that 2 to 5 year hurdle.Good luck!",

To me, if I was checking through tons of applications, being able to quickly skim someone's portfolio and see some projects they have made would be helpful to quickly filter applications. So perhaps it's important for getting past that initial stage so that you can get an interview.I come primarily from game dev where it's absolutely vital to see projects you've worked on if you want to get an interview.",

Right now what most people call \"AI\" (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value. There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that \"it'll do everything we need soon\".There's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.Unlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.I would liken it to the \"Dotcom Bubble\". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because \"having a website for your business\" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.I expect AI to be the same. AI will \"crash\". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).I'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. But if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",

People can point to OpenAI and Anthropic not being profitable, which is the same thing as almost every other tech company when they are in hypergrowth phase: you invest money to gain market share. With that said, with AI now the startup landescape is changing.

Stuff like that?I'm pretty self-reliant, I don't need my manager around for that kind of stuff. I can figure out business logic on my own, I can talk to other engineers, I've always worked at places that had good processes in-place so asking my manager for a Jira ticket would be unheard of.What I expect from my managers is to handle politics, handle cross-team dependencies/conversations, planning, negotiating between product and engineering, etc. I want them operating at a level above me, above the individual. They're there to protect us from external stakeholders, and unblock us from external dependencies.So that's why I'm curious what exactly you mean by \"ghost manager\". If I don't *see* or *speak* to my manager in weeks, not a big deal. They're still doing the job I expect of them behind the scenes. But if they're literally doing nothing for several weeks, that's another story entirely.I'd still much rather have that than a micromanager though.

Python is really fast for development and is dynamically typed which can be nice in some situations but not in others. Go is simple, relatively performant, and also has relatively good time for development its just much more verbose or explicit than python, but this has its benefits in some cases too. I have also been using C# for game Dev in Unity, and its fine. its not my favorite language but its not bad.",

Notably that paper wasn't about money, it was about me wanting to go into CS, and all the really cool things I can do with a CS degree. I wasn't thinking about the money.One big difference about my approach, and the approach I see a lot of people on this subreddit taking is I chose the degree *first*, not my job.A lot of people here decide they want to be a SWE first, and then work backwards to a CS degree. This hyper-focuses their career path and job search, which can make it significantly more difficult. Especially early career where they may not land their ideal role right away, and because they worked backwards from their ideal role, they view it as a failure and get depressed, and give up.Whereas with me, I would've been happy with *any* job remotely in technology. I would've been *totally fine* with help desk. When I was in college I was applying to every internship under the sun. IT, Help Desk, PM, SysAdmin, QA, whatever. If it was tech-related, I applied. Since I didn't have tunnel-vision on any specific role, this gave me flexibility. I couldn't get a SWE internship after my sophomore year, but I did get an offer for a PM internship. As a new grad, I only had 1 SWE offer, and that came pretty late. But I *did* have backups. A return offer from my PM internship, other IT offers, etc. If that late SWE offer never came, I was totally prepared to take one of those other offers, and been completely content with it. I got my CS degree, and I got a job out of it. Goal met. It's much easier to meet a goal like that than it is \"SWE at FAANG\".",

One thing I've found that helped me was identifying the reasons for my burnout - it might be different for everyone, but at least for me, I found that I burnt out if I was doing shit work that no one really cared about and created low impact. Any manual, repetitive work or something which just required copying existing code while the effort was focused around testing for regression. Meanwhile, I worked almost twice as much on another team, but because the work I was doing was interesting, made real impact, and I actually found myself being challenged by the tasks I was getting while also learning a whole lot, I didn't even come close to burnout. Nowadays I always work around my burnout triggers.",

They do this because SWE roles usually impact the whole product, and they want to lower the risk of a bad hire. The downside is it makes the process exhausting and slow for candidates even when you’re already experienced. For UI/UX, employers judge more by portfolios and past projects. If someone can show 10 years of design work, it’s easier for hiring managers to quickly see their value. Their work speaks for itself, and companies don’t always add as many hoops for design roles. It’s not really that one career is easier than the other, it’s just that the hiring culture is different. SWE interviews have become standardized around heavy testing, and design and other fields lean more on proof of work and interviews that focus on collaboration and problem solving.",

Every single person who wants to go into CS posting for advice wants to go into it. You also need an MS or PhD to do the real stuff.Or I said fullstack but if you don't know any databases to a decent level, pick up Postgres. It's easy to setup and use and is commonly used. You might be interested in NestJS to be a bit wider.>I fear that I’m competing with a bunch of people with the same stacks. Is C#/.NET more in demand because they aren’t as popular?Basically. Most CS jobs are in .NET or Java but enough work for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript. You can learn .NET but you'll be a in rough position applying for jobs when you aren't entry level and haven't used it on the job.",

Yes, when they list AngularJS, write down AngularJS even if you know they should have said Angular instead.If at some point someone calls you for an interview for a company X, you open your folder with your CVs and you read the technoes you bullshitted into this version of the CV (obviously put X in the file name).The goal is to land the real interview process, and you gotta go through the automatic blacklisting and the non-tech recruiters filters.Absolutely no one cares about someone having 3 months of dedicated non-professional experience in a techno or just one week half-assed.If they are ready to hire someone that hasn’t worked professionally with a techno, they wouldn’t make the difference between having committed a lot of efforts or not. They wouldn’t actually be able to tell honestly.Multiplying the \"amorced\" interview processes by being open-minded is way more efficient than restricting to a different backend language.Of course feel free to learn dotnet, I love dotnet. Tons of companies use dotnet. But it’s just one of the many different backend technologies and its marketshare isn’t even that big. If getting a job is more important than getting a dotnet job, don’t commit to dotnet, add whatever keyword they want on a job-offer basis.",

They can even say \"Great!\" and not be lying, because what a \"Good WLB\" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.So instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use \"tell me about a time when...\" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. \"When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?\", \"How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?\", \"When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?\", \"When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?\", \"What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?\", \"What are your expectations of \\[role\\]?\", etc, etc.There are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.If from any of the questions it sounds like this is a \"work hard play hard\" team, you reject them.I've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's. I joined them *because* of that, it wasn't a surprise after-the-fact. Almost all of my reverse interview questions are focused on WLB/culture. Not all startups will make you burn the midnight oil.",

How many investments outside of the one from January. How are they getting money currently. Ask about history. Are they a 6 dev team that has built a product and now they are expanding? Is this a 1 year old startup that is rapidly expanding to become profitable? Also in my experience with startups- they’ll be up front about overtime. Ask them how much work goes in a given week and if any people are expected to work extra days or hours. Generally I wouldn’t join a 6 engineer startup because they are usually very early stage, the pay is not as good, and there is a lot of pressure to deliver quickly. But there are exceptions.",

I’m at a similar position in terms of experience, and early in my career I FELT the lack of advanced degree holding me back every day from the opportunities and jobs I wanted to pursue, especially trying to break into Data Science. After 8 years, I don’t feel like it matters nearly as much. There’s definitely still jobs that won’t even look at my resume without an advanced degree. But tbh, those jobs probably still wouldn’t look at me with a Masters, they pay super well and can afford to hire just PhD’s.I think if you want to get into management or entrepreneurship, something like an MBA at a good school where you can network with people who have similar goals or mindsets could be worth it. But if you still want to be on the technical path, Idk I just feel like the time and money you’d have to spend getting the Masters could be spent doing other stuff that might have a bigger impact on career trajectory. Like, for maybe 1/10th the time and money, could you make a point of going to 1 or 2 meetups or conferences related to the jobs you want, and just aggressively network, and get to know everyone in the field so when opportunities pop up, you’ll know people who can help you get those jobs/opportunities?EDIT: I forgot to mention, I think the AI wave/hype is largely dying out. I don’t see the Data Science jobs paying any more than software/data/architecture jobs. In fact a trend I’ve seen recently is, a lot of times the Data Engineering positions are paying more money than the DS positions. I think if you want to switch careers for fulfillment or job satisfaction, getting a Masters could put you in a good spot to secure a job like that, which would otherwise be hard to land without job experience. But I wouldn’t expect it to pay more than you are making now, maybe even a pay cut. But that’s just my two cents.",

Your brain is not as \"plastic\" as it once was, so you will need time to get this stuff locked in (and that is OK).The way I'd go about it is to seriously try the Leetcode Easy. Why Easy? Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.Once you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.Once you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.WRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them. And once recruiters find out, they tell other recruiters privately that this candidate used AI. Even if you somehow make it, you'll be miserable. You will have a case of impostor syndrome that you've never believed can exist. You will know inside that you're way above where you are, because the work will be assigned based on the AI version of you, not you. And if you think you can use AI at work... sure, I'm sure people will not mind as much, but you will NOT be happy in that role.EDIT: A lot of ppl have some flavor of what I said. I wanted to add. Please make sure you know basic Data structures (Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Hash tables) and Algorithms (Sorting, Binary search, divide and conquer, BFS, DFS, Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, etc).",

Stop testing yourself on stuff you haven't practiced yet.Learn the concepts and ideas behind \"algorithms and data structures\". Actually make sure you understand what it is about, how things work in principle. Then start practicing. Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.Once you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.There are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize. Dijkstra's algorithm is named after the dude because it is nothing short of brilliant. I know I am not that clever, so I won't come up with that solution to that problem. but i don't have to memorize how to scan an array for the largest value, because I actually understand what is going on, any way, and can rebuild the solution when it is needed.\\*: Fun fact, chicken sexing is one weird exception that nobody has an explanation for yet.

In interviews, I’ll admit ignorance on a topic and then ask the interviewer to tell me more about it. This happened on a recent interview with some real low-level .NET CLR shit. You get the interviewer talking, because half the time they want to show YOU how smart they are, and then you figure out a “oh, so it’s similar to (some other angle / topic that shows you know what you are talking about AND can synthesize new information).” Tech interviewers will hit you with obscure shit for a variety of reasons, and sometimes it’s to see how you handle being uncertain or rattled.

Went to career fairs, even though I had a job lined up, \"just for fun\".My opinion, is that only real way to get good at interviews is to just keep putting yourself in that hot seat. You're gonna fail a bunch, but that's going to help you get better. Same thing with other things in life.As for the the harsh interviewer, either the interviewer is a dickhead, you suck, or he was just trying to see how you would react to criticism. Maybe a mix.",

What happened to you isn't normal or acceptable, and most interviewers won't treat you that way. The key is recognizing that their nasty comments were a reflection of their poor interviewing skills, not your coding abilities.The best way to build confidence is to shift your mindset from \"they're testing me\" to \"we're solving a problem together.\" When you get stuck or make a mistake, verbalize your thought process out loud and treat it as a collaborative discussion rather than a judgment. Practice explaining your reasoning even when you're unsure, because interviewers want to see how you think through problems, not just whether you get the perfect answer. Most good interviewers will actually guide you toward the solution if you're communicating well and showing logical thinking.I'm on the team that built [AI interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations and build confidence for technical rounds.",

Since you already touched enterprise architecture / IT strategy role a bit, this could be a way to stay close to tech decisions without being the one coding. Cybersecurity / Cloud Operations has lots of problem solving, and you can pick areas that don’t require daily coding.

Juniors hyperfixate on the language and that is the biggest mistake.Companies are looking for specificity in platforms even if a certain part of the tech stack (ex. language) is 100% mandatory. They ideally want you to know their entire tech stack at the level required to service it. Companies with a hard language requirements do not expect you to know any of the languages super deeply. Their logic is more along the lines of “If this guy doesn’t even know JavaScript then he absolutely doesn’t know React, Node, etc. and the gazillion tools we use that require JavaScript. We can toss the resume. “",

        "body": "The Computer Science MSc is usually seen as the more prestigious option because it’s broad and shows you’ve done advanced work in algorithms, systems, and AI. Employers in tech and finance especially recognize it. Since it already has stats and machine learning modules, it gives you a good mix of theory and practical skills that you could apply to data science later. The downside is that you might feel like you’re spending a lot of time on modules you’re not passionate about if they aren’t data focused.The Statistics & Data Science MSc is more specialized. It shows that you’re committed to a career in data and analytics. This can help you stand out if you’re going straight for data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant roles. But data science is competitive as many people enter with a PhD or years of experience. So, with just a master’s, you’d want to build a strong portfolio of projects, maybe internships, and show you can apply your learning to real world problems.If you want maximum flexibility and aren’t 100% sure whether you’ll go into pure data or something adjacent, stick with Computer Science. If you’re confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science. Since you’re also open to more human facing roles like data consultant, either degree could work. Employers will usually care less about the exact title and more about your ability to explain data clearly, work with stakeholders, and use tools like Python, SQL, and visualization platforms.

Or something similar? What kind of status updates are you giving?If someone's *asking* me for my status, whether that be asking me if I'm done yet, or if I need help, or if I'm killing it, or if I'm stuck, or if the deadline is still on target, etc.... that's a failure of communication on my part. People shouldn't need to pull my status out of me.If my task is dragging on for one reason or another, I don't necessarily need help, but that is something I'll communicate to the team so they can react accordingly. Sometimes a delayed ticket can have a ripple affect and threaten bigger deadlines. And if I do need help, I don't hesitate to ask. 12 YOE here as well. I ask from time to time, but when I'm past the 6 month mark at a company, I don't generally need much help, but I'm also not dragging tickets.But if you *need* help, *ask for it*.

I didn't have it or any AWS experience and was hired since I used Azure at my last job. The cloud certs are the only ones I ever see and only about 10% of the time. Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.Rest of certs are scams.*How do you stand out more after graduating?*1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.>still managed to hit \\~120 applications. No job still.In 4 months, that is slack. 10 applications a day = 300 a month is still slack.

Your projects should mimic what you would do at a company (designing, architecting, testing, deploying, etc).You need to show employers that you are a low-risk hire that can easily jump on task without much hand-holding. Right now, your resume doesn't give me that confidence because it's mostly game dev focused. If I were a hiring manager and I needed to quickly find someone to fix my shit, I would immediately toss your resume because you sell yourself as a game dev, not a creative well-rounded problem-solver.Also, it seems you're located in Turkey. I've heard the SWE job market terrible there. Are you only looking for remote positions?",

I would say after you have a good resume (hopefully after this recent change taking his advice along with formatting it to be 1 page) it may take a while to get an opportunity but just keep applying, eventually stuff stacks up fast especially if your highlight your language specific experience for a role that it’s critical for.

Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.As the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \\~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).I'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",

        "body": "For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.If you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.EU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more clear roadmaps and step by step guides for both software development and cybersecurity.",

So even if you’re not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.For projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code. If you can also write a short readme explaining what it does, why you built it, and how to use it, recruiters will notice.",

If you can support your lifestyle on your salary (maybe even with savings etc) then you are taking a chance at what might be a bigger payoff down the road vs what you would get at a public company.For example, I joined a D round start up, worked there for one year but exercised my options when leaving, then the company was acquired one year later. So I made 1800% in two years. You're not going to get that kind of return at a public company, though the value of the stock would be available sooner and guaranteed. Personally, young people should take more risks. The really small startups might be such a gamble they're not worth it, but I think going for a private company that has a good trajectory and is well established is a fantastic idea and a risk younger folks should be willing to take. These opportunities are not available to the public and they are what separate capitalists from laborers.Most important is finding somewhere you can tolerate going everyday where your manager has your back and people aren't dickheads.",
