I keep a sticky note next to my desk as a reminder.Also bookmarking your repo. Looks super solid for showing end-to-end flow. If you spin up the Streamlit dashboard, definitely share it back!",

It's okay to trial.b) There is no \"right\" way, in that it's a moving target that depends heavily on context. There are certainly better ways, but you'll never have everything exactly as it \"should\" be. So, keep learning and don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough.c) Focus on filtering out the noise. Some new features or technologies will be useful, some won't. Identifying which ones are worth your time is a great value add.d) On the above, find an expert in the field that you trust and use info from them as a North Star. Don't take everything as gospel of course, but it'll at least give you some direction.",

If it's not you, you have to keep pushing back. If it is you and you're consistently underestimating, you need to change that. There are differences in company/team culture where it's speed over quality (cost is often the third element; ie you can have something quick and cheap, but it will be low quality, or you can have something cheap and good, but will take more time). Again, if this doesn't sit well with you it's time for a change.In short, it has less to do with the job of DE vs SWE but more with your team.

Fast forward 6 months the data team is still trying to get their complex and brittle near real time analytics engine up and running while folks are asking “where is my data?”I don’t think it matters how someone defines a “data product” (really who cares?), what matters more is the thought process that you should first identify “why” someone needs something data related and then work backwards in your data stack to deliver the data to them in a format that makes sense (i.e. dashboard, downloadable dataset, or landing bulk data in a bucket/SFTP)Lastly, there have been a handful of times at companies I have worked at where they realized “oh, this isn’t actually a Data Engineering problem but actually something we need to build into our main application.” A lot of times people confound that just because something involves data, it is somehow a Data Engineering problem to solve, not always the case.",

Add another column with priority (High, medium, low)Take the total estimated implementation time in hours (+/- 20%) and divide it by your total estimated working hours over the next month. That's how many connectors per hour you're required to finish this project. Is it 5 per hour? Is it 3 per hour? Whatever the answer, does it seem reasonable to accomplish knowing your skillset?Meet with the leadership with your spreadsheet, have them identify what is most important. Communicate a reasonable expectation of how many of these you think you'll get done in the next month given the information above.Edit: While the task does honestly seem like BS, this is a chance to get an insane amount of exposure and knowledge around the MS fabric ecosystem and data pipeline building. Document your accomplishments as there will likely be many. Use this opportunity to optimize as much of your workflow as possible and you can leverage into something much better than this. At your next interview you can describe how you were given what you thought was an impossible task and instead of running away from it, you consulted with other professionals regarding the best way to approach it, took away best practices, and implemented a plan to complete the job. Whether or not you're successful at this job, you at least did everything in your power to understand and complete the task.Good luck!",

Hackerrank Advanced SQL and LeetCode’s harder DB questions are solid drills, but nothing matches shipping a mini warehouse: spin up Snowflake’s free tier, pipe data with dbt, visualize in Apache Superset, and wire alerting tests with dbt-expectations. I’ve used Superset and dbt Cloud, and DreamFactory slips in when I want a quick REST layer on top of my practice schemas so a small Flask front end can hammer them with real requests.

Hubspot may have some slower streams which could significantly slow down the rest of the sync if they are the first to run. A general suggestion for API sources (especially when slow) is to deselect any streams that you don't need.In regards to the destination performance (BigQuery), we are starting to roll out our \"Direct Load\" (https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/using-airbyte/core-concepts/direct-load-tables) which may speed up BigQuery load performance up to 2-3x. That said, if the source connector is the real bottleneck, the BigQuery performance boost may not help as much in your scenario. With API-type sources, much of the performance constraint is often in the API itself, but without diving deeper, I can't say specifically if that is true in your case.I hope this info is helpful - and sorry you are seeing poor performance here. Let me know if any of the tips here help, and I or my colleagues will check back again to see if we can further assist.Cheers,AJUPDATE: BigQuery destination connector >=3.0 now supports \"Direct Load\", per changelog here: [https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#changelog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#changelog)",

Sometimes I would stumble on the answer I needed in the results or the actual link I was looking for somewhere buried in the comments 3 links in and apply it as needed. But for the past several years that's become less and less useful as (I assume) the [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) has trended more towards people treating search engines like people, so I've started needing to do the same. Now my questions are more like \"*How do I add X onto Y?\" + \"\"Z language\"\"*.Going to something like W3schools.com and looking through the functions by language/category and applying them to the situation at hand step-by-step until I get what I needed has always worked, though it's obviously more effort than a single result giving you a ready-made answer. So has watching videos related to the subject I'm trying to resolve.So.. I guess my advice is to change your search patterns to be more like natural language (and utilize [advanced search engine options like flags](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) to filter out bad results), look for \"beginner\" type sites to help narrow down your search criteria (or expand it if needed), and try to include keywords that will help you find examples.

You are placing your operational decisions in the context of business decisions.Fwiw, it’s not reasonable to expect an out of the box solution to outperform something bespoke. And your conversation is really about custom in-house versus a customisable off the shelf (often abbreviated COTS) solution. It’s not really meaningful to bring open or closed source into it- some of the slowest, crustiest, dogshit code on earth is very expensive and has a proprietary license attached. And if your thinking is ‘in-house = free’ like open source, you are very much mistaken. Honestly, not even open source is actually free, you just don’t need to pay for a license. We can’t really comment on your particular situation without knowing more about it. What code did you implement your custom solution in, for example? What is it actually doing? Is one solution parallelised whilst the other not? Where are your bottlenecks? In 2025, I’m very suspicious of any process that takes 5 actual minutes for less than a million or so rows, frankly. It suggests a configuration issue. But as a more general thing, software is like a pet- it needs to be fed, watered, and periodically taken to the vet. Eventually, you will need to deal with it humanely. If your org can support a development team to maintain your in house solution, good for you! It may be worth considering how well that dev team scales, what else they do, and what their long term prospects look like. Consider the time and salaries of those developers versus an off the shelf approach, for example. You seem to be operating under the illusion that your in house solution is free, when in actual fact their on-cost will be about 2-3x their salary. Your organisation will need to pay that, forever- or at least ass long as that software exists. And if someone gets laid off, do you have the redundancy, resilience, and skill overlap to maintain it?And yes, training new staff becomes an issue when you have custom software- ask any game dev studio why game engines are essential even though custom code is faster, for example. It’s an ongoing problem for businesses, and the bad news is that it looks like you’re thinking a bit like an architect.",

That's not really \"worth saving\" because your time will cost more.** If it was more, maybe it would be worth it - but this is the logic i would use to decide these things \\- now if you have some **hard requirement,** like data has to arrive by time X, or has to run faster than Z, that could be an issue and that's the moment you look into speeding it up. At this point you could try things like fast backends if you use sql, async, parallelism in dlt. If that doesn't solve the issue, you could write a custom job. Yes a custom job introduces new problems, but that's the price to pay for solving the original problem, if indeed there was one.",

For extra information, this specific pipeline was a glorified select * into our table from a remote oracle db. In this specific case we just 1. Read source table into polars2. Compare with current schema3. Save it into a local parquet file for audits4. Load into SQL Server with csv dump -> bulk insert -> mergewith DLT I skipped the 3rd step, as it was a quick POC. I don't have the exact logs, it was a few weeks ago, but the dlt time distribution was:~10s extract~3,5m normalisation~1.5m insertWhich was weird, since we're reading relational data, and as far as I know normalisation is mostly relevant for nested data. Still, I've tried following dlt optimization instructions, but they didn't help sadly. Here I'd like to note that DLT setup docs for the different sources are top-tier. Even if we didn't end up using it, in a ton of cases we've used their pipeline guides as sources, they're more complete than their counterparts in many cases.Regarding your architect comment - yeah, I feel like I simply don't see all the cost factors, and these are actually quite hard to find. This was the main motivator for the question, currently it seems like I'm one of the main drivers of tech solutions / choices in my team, and I'd like to skip some painful realizations if possible :grinning_face: Regarding cost, you also have these hidden costs with COTS solutions as well, no?1. Integrating these solutions together is usually pretty hard, but the DE space might be better in this regards (AFAIK dagster + dlt + dbt works pretty nice together). Still you now have n systems to maintain, which can break in unexpected ways at the interaction points2. Lower development speed due to worse performance (this could be offset with way smaller dev datasets I guess)3a. You either lock versions -> have to self-code unimplemented functionality -> you have a frankenstein, and the same garden analogy applies3b. You keep up to date with updates -> migration costs on updates, hidden changes can break workflowsTo me, these costs seem to be on the same OOM over the long term. But again, I have too little experience to properly quantify them, so I'm basically talking out of my ass",

The pains you are encountering are normal, and technology maturity has nothing to do with these.There are a few options depending on size of topic and frequency of user requests. If these are low, then I would suggest giving kSQL a try, I believe it is its initial purpose. Otherwise like another redditor said: writing a little spark tool, like a cli with a --sql option can work.But keep in mind this is going to deserialize potentially all messages in a topic at a time.So if this is too high workload for your laptops, then this is the signal to replicate the data to a system made for data exploration. Your parquet attempts with Kafka connect or Spark are good ones. So keep digging in that direction.The ignoring of tombstones is really strange, it's just a null value for a given key, it should propagate. Is it your experience or is this coming from documentation?Then for the Avro->Parquet with Spark attempt you should not have to use Arrow. Just go from reading the topic (and deserialization) straight to `write.options(...).parquet(...)` There might be some tweaking to allow for dynamic schemas depending on which topic you read, which folder you write to, and some tweaking in the frequency of that job to not write too-small-filesEdit: Additionally: for Avro to Json with Kafka Connect try and set `value.converter.decimal.format` to `numeric` there were a couple of issues like this with Json serde apparently:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-481%3A+SerDe+Improvements+for+Connect+Decimal+type+in+JSON",

But what really wonders me, how often that happens. As I said, it also happens in Trino. And Kafka Connect ignores Tombstone, is also documented. There is a property \\`transforms.TombstoneHandler.behaviour=drop\\_warn\\`. It does not write a Null value in a parquet file",

Yes, I am an engineer, and I use Chat GPT as and when required, like most of us. It's just an LLM, just like how you use google, but much faster in finding things what we need. I don't see anything wrong with it. My main motivation in writing this edition was that I couldn't find any working example with the latest Airflow with the latest dbt Core online, and while I was trying to build the setup for me, I documented it for my newsletter, thinking it would be useful for atleast one person out there. Registering for my newsletter to get the code will incentivise me to put out more such articles on my newsletter and to build a community of learners. It is just a small reward for me, that will cost you nothing. If you don't want to register, it's ok, you can dm me and I am more than happy to send the code to you privately. Everything has been done with good intentions, and when you diss my hardwork like this, it hurts fyi. I hope you understand, and I wish you the very best!",

Billing is an operational, transactional process. Don't give it to data scientists. That's kinda like asking a bricklayer to create architectural drawings for a new home. (Not a perfect analogy!)If you have other systems that do things that need to be billed, but none of them can do the billing and you don't have a proper system for billing, you need to fix that as part of your basic tech landscape. I'm surprised you don't have a finance/accounting system - they typically also handle billing.You need a person in your org who knows already how other orgs do this kind of thing, and can work out how to do it at your place. You could get a short term consultant in for this, if permanent hiring isn't an option.Once you have a decent \"destination\" system architecture planned out, you may need data people to help create the data integrations between those systems (if they don't talk natively or if the vendors can't help). Data scientists could potentially help with that, but it's not in any way a data science task. Python would be one language option for this, but not the only one. Fabric is not the right platform to build on, in any case, because ~~all~~ almost all of Fabric's data storage is intended for analytic purposes, not operational ones like this.",

Specifically, your existing process’ dependency on manually copying and pasting data around is something that no technology platform is going to offer an easy button solution for. If you really want to improve this, you need to first sit with your team and do the hard work of mapping out this process end-to-end. Then you need to identify all of the manual bottlenecks and find ways to aggressively stamp them out. Anywhere that you’re manually dropping off a file or copying and pasting data needs to be reimagined to get away from the dependency on someone manually loading or manipulating data. This will be difficult for you to do without some form of logic represented as code (eg Python, SQL). However, once you can do this, the technology can begin to help you orchestrate your code across your test and production environments. Turn the problem on its head: your position is that a software program is “overkill” for this invoicing solution. The CEO of your company would probably be alarmed to understand that the invoicing system is a rats nest of manual process and tribal knowledge. If this process is revenue-generating for the business, it’s worth taking the time to unwind the tribal knowledge and be able to represent this business logic as tested and validated code.",

Sitting at a coffee shop? Take note of the products they offer, the staff they have, any social media presence they have, etc. Then, start thinking about the type of analytics they'd want to do. Inventory management, demand forecasting, sales analysis, sentiment analysis of social media comments, etc. Then, think about how you'd model that data. Put together a schema, maybe visualize it with a diagram, and then test it by writing queries against your schema to address the analyses you came up with. If you can write queries against the schema that achieve everything you're trying to do, then it's likely a sufficient schema. If you can't write good SQL against the schema, then rework it.And as a bonus, you can make it as complicated as you want. What if the coffee shop has multiple locations? What are some likely candidates for slowly changing dimensions, and how do you handle them? What if the coffee shop wanted real-time sales analysis to predict demand at 15-minute intervals?In my opinion, you don't need a website to give you examples of businesses that need data models unless you want validation that your model is satisfactory. All you need is a walk around town and an analytical mindset.",

Also, cost can get out of control with having too much of the logic inside Snowflake. Transformations will be harder to test and patch, debug, optimize, etc. Better, use Snowflake for what it does best which is storing data and querying data.If you just want do tests and DQ you could implement a tool that this job well, like Great Expectations.If you anticipate a growing amount of transformations and interdependent business logic, use a tool which is great at that, like dbt (which can also do unit and dq tests). Also dbt encourages documentation, which can be proagated to Snowflake if needed, and if your project is larger you will benefit from the lineage functionality in dbt.\"No logic in the database\" is a dogma I'm following for almost 2 decades and I have never regretted that.However, if you do not care about the cost, have a limited amount of transformations without too complex logic and rather prefer to have everything in one basket, go ahead.Snowflake & dbt can be a dream team, if you stick to good solution and modelling patterns and this combination is widely adopted.",

You are hitting most of the key pieces for a clean modern data stack.**On the architecture:** Snowpipes + dynamic tables is a good combo for simplicity. Just watch out for costs with dynamic tables if you have high refresh frequencies. The integer surrogate keys vs hash keys decision is smart, easier to manage and debug.**dbt thoughts:** Even with Snowflakes native lineage, dbt still brings value for testing, documentation, and standardized transformations. The macro system alone can save you tons of time. Plus if you ever need to migrate platforms, having your logic in dbt makes it way more portable.**Orchestration concerns:** You are right to be worried. Tasks + dynamic tables work for simple stuff but get messy fast with complex dependencies. At DataToBiz we have seen clients start there and end up needing Airflow or similar within 6 months. Consider budgeting for a proper orchestrator from the start, saves headaches later.**Random tip:** Since you are on three separate accounts, make sure your CI/CD handles cross account permissions properly. That's usually where people get tripped up.The biggest lesson from similar migrations is don't underestimate the orchestration piece. Everything else you can iterate on, but orchestration becomes the bottleneck if you get it wrong early.What's your timeline looking like for the POC? Sometimes it helps to start simple and add complexity incrementally.",

The goal is to use cheap table scans and drop the source data into an intermediate temp file for staging. (Parquet or one of its derivative)Moving data out of the source is sometimes described as creating your \"bronze\" layer. Personally I think that sounds a little pretentious. But there is a lot of responsibility involved. You need to know the source, and avoid burying it with unnatural workloads that it was never designed to handle. In general it should be safe to do table scans on a clustered index in the source database. Those simple queries should go unnoticed (ideally).The next part is loading the data back into a warehouse or lake house. This is called building your silver layer (at the lowest granularity required). Basically this work involves reading data back out of the temp files and then loading it into a star schema.Spark is where the magic happens.My preference for all this data movement involves the heavy use of spark. Microsoft loves spark as much as any other company (besides databricks itself of course). I would learn spark if you aren't familiar. That is where you find as much compute as you need, and is far more important than other decisions you may need to make (like whether to send data to a db, or dwh, or lakehouse... and whether the data will live in fabric or elsewhere)",

This is in line with existing best practices in Synapse and elsewhere - use Entra instead, e.g. Managed Identity, Service Principals, et cetera instead. So when setting up logins et cetera in Synapse, I'd suggest following that best practice. Here's a doc on this - whole doc is useful, but I've linked to the section on disabling local Auth: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/active-directory-authentication#disable-local-authentication* Ditto on SAS keys and account keys- if you have to, use the user delegated kind. But user passthrough is what we support in both and the modern recommendation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-storage-files-storage-access-control?tabs=user-identity* Dedicated can take a fair bit of fine tuning to run at its best. 500 Gb isn't very large by its standards, which is good, but also, means that you're paying its overheads without getting as much out of it. Fabric Warehouse does a much better job that Dedicated did with that sort of volume, generally* Depending on your needs, I'd consider Serverless as well. It doesn't require as much tuning to get the best out of it.Happy to answer questions.Edit: and just to be very clear, I'd generally strongly advise new development target Fabric over Synapse. Synapse remains Generally Available and supported, but isn't seeing significant feature development. Fabric has a lot of improvements that aren't in Synapse, and continues to get more. But it doesn't sound like that's an option here, so the advice I'm giving here is intended to help you make the best of it, as I think it's important we support our customers regardless of platform. Also, this is my personal opinion, not official advice :).",

That shit is dead; and the support was atrocious even when it was in its prime. I think there was even a blog from a high level vp at Microsoft named Bogdan. I'll try to find it. ...Microsoft keeps changing their strategic direction. They are cannibalizing Synapse to try to drive higher market share for their new Fabric. In '22 and '23 I saw virtually no enhancements being made in Synapse, and Microsoft started putting banners in that portal to get everyone to move out to Fabric. That is where they decided to make future investment. Microsoft loves to rug-pull on their data engineering customers. Be careful.",

Also why can't you use snowflake or data bricks? Is it your IT policies limiting them? We work with both in dod and are deploying snowflake. If you wanted to make the investment now you could try to figure out how to get snowflake or data bricks so you don't have to redo it when synapse is dropped for fabric",

Large dimensions and facts will benefit from clustered columnstore compression, saving tons of space which makes the snapshot dimension design palatable. Insert only processing will run without problems. Take care to align distribution columns on facts and most commonly used dimensions and query performance should be fine.For smaller dimensions, use row based storage (heap or clustered index). Avoid replicate distribution like the plague.",

It's very likely that you will change jobs every 2-5 years, or change teams/roles within the same company (or migrations) and you will likely use a different tech stack, data architecture, and/or have a different role within the larger data lifecycle.It's often recommended to learn the fundamentals rather than a specific tool. The good-ish news is that most reasonable companies understand that every data engineering role is different and they will allow some time to ramp up before they throw you into the fire. Also, with enough years of experience you may find yourself removed from the specifics of any one tool. You will be further removed from hands on day-to-day work.",

The access control and governance piece is usually what I find to be missing from the DIY architectures that are posted here, but if this was wrapped up nicely as a deployable unit that could be dropped seamlessly into any AWS, Google, or Azure environment, it could be quite powerful for core data pipeline and interactive analysis workloads, even if missing some of the fancier bells and whistles in something like Databricks. Probably the biggest issue is that it relies on a team having sufficient knowledge of the stack components to maintain the underlying components in production, but this goes back to the packaging and deployment piece. How much of the stack has to be “always on” and how much of it can be spun up and down as needed? The more ephemeral it is, the better it stands as an open alternative. It has to be sufficiently cheaper than something like Databricks while not missing too much core functionality. Can live without Genie, but can’t live without centralized access control, lineage, and on-demand compute.You will also need some kind of interactive layer for this stack, whether it’s Jupyter, Sagemaker/colab, local IDE, etc. Maybe that goes without saying. Very interesting read. Thanks for sharing. I might try spinning this up.",

It lacks features like environment isolation and fine-grained authorization, making it difficult to use in production. In many ways, it's more comparable to EMR Jupyter Notebooks. While EMR Jupyter supports PySpark directly, there are plenty of scenarios where SQL is sufficient for end users.Recently, there's growing interest in using Flink SQL for data lakehouse—and even so-called streamhouse—architectures. Until Flink SQL Gateway offers support for application cluster mode and stronger isolation, I believe Kyuubi remains a strong option for providing secure, multi-tenant SQL access to Flink.Besides, Kyuubi supports multiple compute engines beyond Flink, making it a versatile choice for enterprises adopting diverse data processing backends.",

Give your models tags, use selectors to run those models, then have a script that runs those selectors in the order that you want. Of course it can get a bit more complex than that depending on the complexity of what you’re doing, we have many clients in different data warehouses with multiple dbt projects for a bunch of SAAS applications we make, so there’s a lot of stuff like retrieving keys for dbt users, decrypting, connecting to snowflake with the user and running dbt for their warehouse, and a bunch of other stuff going on in the background. But it definitely makes orchestration a lot easier, I pass various arguments into a single python script and can have hundreds or thousands of dbt models in any one of our dbt projects by orchestrating this single script that calls one function.",

But if you have a volume of data that can easily fit on your laptop, you shouldn't need any tools that can't run on your laptop.Keep it simple. If it's all relational data, you can use a local database. DuckDB, ClickHouse, and Firebolt Core all have native functions for reading from Parquet files you've pulled from IMF. You could even just use Postgres with [pg_parquet](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_parquet). Pick your favorite database, ingest the data into it with a `CTAS`, and if you're already using Metabase, it can connect to all of the above. Throw out the Parquet files once you've ingested the data.From there, use your database wisely. If you stick with DuckDB, create new schemas to separate datasets into logical chunks so you don't just have all your tables in one giant pile. If you need to transform data, you can just use SQL. If you need to do complicated transformations that you don't want to do with SQL, plug in dbt. Name your tables well. Use table and column comments to make sure you don't forget any important context.",

But I’m thinking more from an enterprise use case, where memory needs to do a lot more heavy lifting: 1/Recall with context binding what was said, *why* a decision was made 2/Cross-agent orchestration multiple agents can coordinate with shared stuff 3/Access controls and auditability who can access/edit memory, and when, time blockers?That’s a few layers beyond chat history. Maybe mem0 or zep are headed in that direction, but haven’t seen anything production-grade yet. Curious if anyone here’s gotten this working in a reliable, governed way?",

We do something similar with a ticketing agent at my org, where if a user makes a request similar to a recent prior request, it will ask if it is a duplicate. Whereas that recall is limited to the same user in our case, it can configured to recall enterprise-wide conversions.With that said, we haven't implemented anything like this, but if be curious to hear if/how others have done it.",

I.e. you run at a given point so many tasks in parallel that resources are maxxed out and don't clear quickly enough prior to scheduled tasks timing out. And you get into a cascade. Best process to debug this if you can be confident that functionally, your tasks work is to approach a production scenario from super simple testing. Run 10, 20, 30%... of your typical number of parallel tasks but just to a BashOperator echo. Scale percentage. Then move the executed task closer to prod settings and again, step up from 10% task load. Rinse and repeat, see where outages start to occur and as what % of total. You need to approach this systematically and only ever change 1 parameter in testing to be able to identify a root cause.",

        "body": "The main limitation I've run into using BQ is the trade-off between cost and latency. I suppose this is a fundamental aspect of using columnstore databases, given that updates are computationally expensive.Datastream converts a CDC stream into batch merges (\"background apply jobs\") when writing to BQ. Each time a background apply job is run, BQ will scan the entire table regardless of the partitioning on the table. But, if you don't need super-frequent updates, you can change the \"max\\_staleness\" setting on the destination table in BQ to limit how frequently background apply jobs run. This should greatly decrease costs if you aren't already doing it:[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#cost-best-practices](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#cost-best-practices)As for setting up your own merge ingestion, the cost of each merge is based on the amount of data scanned in all relevant partitions of the destination table:[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#partitioned\\_tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#partitioned_tables)Unless I'm mistaken, this means that the partitioned column has to be included in the merge condition in order for the partitioning strategy to provide any cost-savings benefit. In practice, I found that partitioning on the primary key (or an integer component of it, if it's a composite PK) is the best way to minimize merge costs. And obviously, reducing the frequency of your merge updates will help here as well.",

It performs better if I use DIFY and force just a 1024 char chunk, with 100 char overlap, but even that tends to return the docs header boilerplate fragments, and not specific code that examples or describes the thing I'm asking about. This may just be a hard use case, where you want to ask \"how do I use this cli tool to build xyz\", and have it not return \"to use cli tool for xyz do the following...\" but instead, grab the example code and list of command line options. Probably would be better on a big organization SOP that had clear things like \"policy on internal document encryption is this and that\". In a nice clean paragraph.

When we modernized a steel plant, we started with a shadow pipeline that wrote to a separate lake while the legacy jobs kept running; operators got weekly side-by-side reports, so by the time we flipped the switch they already trusted the numbers. For live dashboards, push events from the line into an Event Hub, land them in Delta, then cache the viz layer (we use Power BI agg tables) so queries never hit production gear. Skip true sub-second unless quality or safety needs it; 5-min windows keep costs sane and still feel instant on the floor. We also set up a burn-down board of manual tasks and let each shift knock one off; that small win loop mattered more than any lunch-and-learn. I’ve run setups with Ignition SCADA for tag collection and Snowflake for fast JOINs, but DualEntry was the piece that finally let finance and ops share one source without nightly CSV fights.

In this local cache, your call is first INSERT so I'd call EL-T.

If you transform the data in any way before storing the data somewhere, then ETL. If you store the data in its original format under the assumption that you'll transform it later, then it's ELT.

You can just read Excel as a CSV and bulk insert into Azure SQL and then do your merge. Why introduce an arbitrary data format and add complications like a whole other platform Databricks when you're probably just dealing with a few hundred rows?[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#bulk-insert-command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#bulk-insert-command)That being said:* ADLS is *not* NoSQL ... it's a storage layer. Databricks supports reading ADLS Gen 2 - that's where your Delta tables are stored in Azure when using Unity Catalog.* Not sure what you mean by \"I'm assuming you can't because ... NoSQL\" - Databricks is based on Spark, it will happily read unstructured data in files from your data lake.And while in your specific case you can't do it because you have multiple sheets, *if* your Excel file was just a single sheet you can just read it directly in Databricks SQL`select * from read_files('/Volumes/my_volume/uploads/test.xlsx', schemaEvolutionMode => 'none')`(You can use an arbitrary ABFSS location if you provide a credential to Databricks SQL's [data access configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/sql/data-access-configuration) but Volumes are a lot more convenient and easier to manage.)",

DMS is overkill when you don't need live replication, just periodic QA refreshes.Glue works well here since you have already got the catalog setup. PII obfuscation is perfect for Spark transformations, plus you can easily sample/subset during ETL.Few things to watch out for:* Make sure your obfuscation is consistent if needed (same customer = same fake name)* Subsetting can be tricky, keep referential integrity in mind, don't just grab random rows* Glue jobs can get pricey if you run them too often, but for periodic refreshes it's usually fineHonestly, if your dataset isn't huge you could also just do Lambda + RDS snapshot. Restore, obfuscate, point QA to new instance. Sometimes simpler wins.But yeah, stick with Glue if you want flexibility for complex transformations. Just test your obfuscation logic thoroughly. QA teams hate when referential integrity breaks or performance gets weird compared to prod.",

I agree that if there are substantial improvements in AI consistency and rigidity that something like this could work out okay, but just based off of your user story, you are skipping the idea that typically these requests flow from:Director: We need X and Y info for our QBRBPM: Gotcha, what we actually need is X and Y filtered for Z1,…Zi for date range Date1-Datei.Reporting Lead:Gotcha, what we actually need is a dashboard of above requirements in various different categorizations & breakouts for data from domain1 and domain2, and include the micro filters that actually make up filters Z1-ZiReporting Dev:Okay, this is a significantly more involved process than the reporting lead believes, we can accomplish about 60% of the ask with given information, an addl 20% is achievable if we go through this 2 week permissions loop, and the final 20% is currently non-existantReporting Dev creates ticket details, Reporting Lead submits ticket to DE team, work is completed anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months from now.The data needs that are now available, are no longer aligned with the pain points the business is trying to get data on, repeat.—-Hopefully that helps make sense. The painpoint is not at the “we have data, lets make a visual” level, its at the “we have x data access, and need y data access, or we need z pipeline built out for our use case” level.Which is what you addressed in your user story as well, but like, the business user will have absolutely no clue about this if that makes sense. They barely understand how challenging the “curated” views sent to analysts are from the jump, although its not necessarily their job to know that.Maybe i misunderstood but i hope this is interesting at least, there is a lot of process automation opportunity I think given an extremely well architected solution.",

The business just don't think in terms of \"I need this report to be a 12 month rolling average that can be sliced by location and drills through to existing reporting with colour coding\", and they shouldn't need to.The communication gap comes from business users having clear understandings of the problem but can't (and shouldn't) be able to solution specifics. But at the same time centralise BI or engineering teams sit outside the business and, having been burned by getting blamed before, want to push the risk and design back to the business as much as possible.So pretty much every place I've worked has done kind of communications barrier between technical and business but when you get right into it, it's really more about the data side being unwilling or unable to think about the business process and do effective blue sky thinking about how to leverage their talents against a shared problem and pushing the business to become data designers instead and come to them with a spec.I reckon there's definitely some value to be had by getting an AI in the loop somewhere to help translating, but I don't think it attacks the core of why people always have this problem and the model you've described sounds like it's trying to remove the need for data development to understand the business world and problems. I think generally the opposite should hold, which is that data teams who want to only do the tech and not the people work are the problem.Not the worst example of a shitty pitch for yet another data AI tool startup hustle in that you've picked a good problem area, and there'd be an audience for it, but personally I'd give a hard pass to anything selling me the idea that the people problem of business/tech culture clash can be solved with a tech product.",

I’ve had had some success and made a lot of duds when testing and deploying AI/LLM solutions for non or semi-technical SMEs in enterprise orgs, so when I read your idea, I recall a lot of those learnings.To me, the communication gap you are looking at is the like, 20% problem that requires 80% of the effort to solve. It’s one of those permutative problems that when solved destroys agility and flexibility of organizations and when pushed all the way in the other direction of giving everyone free reign and no direction can make other orgs look like a barrel of monkeys. So all that preface is to say tools that presuppose that you will be able to solve knowledge transfer between more than like 3 layers of a business of how information passes through competency layers (ex in my prev. comment) is a cursed problem. Because of that, I see problems with a tool that suggests that a Director can cross 5+ competence layers and genuinely get what they need, because to be completely clear: While data is served at a wide scale to many ICs and SMEs, the general purpose of all data is to help teams inform leaders, because all of that data is meant for those teams to make better decisions, and to then show data of improvement to the leaders. So for a tool to cut across all of this and save money or time or both, you would need to create a tool that solve all of these layers based off of a leader level prompt, which is really hard to do, and I think cost/success% wise outside of scope of existing tech. What I personally see as the clear line path for llm products are places where you can extend a sme 50% of the way in the direction of a couple of other domains that require proficiency and time spent learning. Tools that can take a great manager with ok tech chops, and solve the little simple ad-hoc tasks that you would originally bog down report devs / automation analysts in excel, idk the examples arent always great they are niche and reveal themselves through iteration. I think that smart LLM practitioners will not try to replace the human in the middle, not because its the right thing to do, but because its the financially prudent and performant thing to do, and they will support SMEs to become more proficient in adjacent domains. More so, at least, than was previously possible or expectable in the past. That will help solve the communication gap (a bit) in these orgs that prevent end to end technical implementations today.Sorry if this was too long! It’s a really interesting topic. I think good historical cues to take are to look at how no-code / low-code tools have started, been hyped, and where they ended up. Sometimes they do pretty good (Power Automate, Zapier), but they never have a “playing field levelling effect” across all layers of an org. Rn a Director could use Power Automate to already pull and transform their own data, but they won’t. Not to say those loops can’t get better and more accessible, that does seem to be a good use case for LLMs, I just think that it will more often than not require that someone knows something about the field they are using an LLM solution for, even if its an adjacent one (which is the more practical value prop of AI except for OpenAI who get to be the core chatbot, lucky them).",

        "body": "Here's my list of why it's tough to teach yourself.**Figuring out what to learn**This is the number 1 problem. How do you know you are \"learning the basics\"? Which YouTube videos are you watching? There's so much stuff, it's hard to pick. There's even a bit of procrastination. Some lay out plans that will take years to complete which means it won't get done. They will add an intro programming courses, maybe discrete math, maybe SQL, maybe operating systems. The fact is, most people never get much past the first course. Lesson: you don't have to plan that far ahead**Hard to make progress**It's tough to motivate yourself. For a handful of people, learning to program is (kind of) fun. For others, it's boring (yet, not easy). You have to learn syntax, e.g., a for-loop in C. You have to learn what you can do with that syntax, e.g., iterate through arrays.**You fail to learn control flow properly**If you're learning a procedure language, or a language that has procedural aspects, like Python, it becomes useful to emulate the computer, going one step at a time. You want to know what happens at every step. This low-level approach helps you understand how your program behaves.The human mind often skips steps, making assumptions about what stuff does. This is where it's helpful to learn a debugger, or do the poor man's equivalent and print \"debug\" statements.**There's not a lot of material on debugging**As a beginner, you're likely to write buggy code, ie, code that has mistakes. Fixing those bugs means determining *what* caused the bug, i.e., identifying the bug. Then, *fixing* the bug.For as much time as a beginner spends learning material, surprisingly little covers debugging.**There's a lot of advice**Perhaps the most common one is \"build projects\". Here's the thinking behind that approach. Beginners sometimes learn from tutorials. However, many tutorials are too advanced for beginners. Worse than that, they tell you *what* to do, but not *why*.You might wonder why they don't explain things. After all, don't learners want to learn? Here's the problem. How do you know how much the person watching your tutorial knows? If you can barely program, then you'll spend time talking about programming basics, and the part about building what you're building is now a fraction of the tutorial.Even if you know programming basics, it's still not enough. For example, you might be following a tutorial on React (not recommended for beginners). It will tell you to do this and that for React, but not the *design* of React. What was the philosophy behind React? Why does it look the way it does (i.e., why Javascript)? Explaining how React does stuff takes time, and tutorials predominantly skip over it, and jump into using it. These tutorials fail to show you the big picture. Instead, you're in the weeds (stuck in the minute details).Some beginners begin jumping from one tutorial to another, building stuff, but not understanding what they are building nor how to change what they are building.This leads to the common advice *build a project*. Here's my beef with that approach. You need to learn basics first. You need to learn basic syntax, control flow. You need a mental model of what the computer is doing. You need basic debugging skills. You need to do small exercises to help you learn, say, for-loops.That part, to many, is boring. The other complaint I have is you're asked \"find something you're passionate about\". Most beginners have a hard time identifying what they want to build, or they want to build something far too sophisticated, like a 3D game. They struggle with coding tic-tac-toe, and that's far too boring to be fun.The analogy I typically give is learning a foreign language. There are two popular approaches. The academic approach teaches it like an English teacher teaches English, i.e., it's about grammar. The other approach is to learn phrases. The second way is meant to avoid long hours of learning a language's grammar so you can take a vacation somewhere and get by with little knowledge of the language.I liken the second approach to building a project. It only works if the following happen: you have a reasonable sized project (can be hard), you figure out what you need (also, can be hard), you find what you need (also hard). The driving motivation is you're building something you can use. A programming exercise doesn't do that, but I feel it's a necessary prerequisite.Still, some can manage to learn enough of a language by searching for what they need. But the part they leave out is how they search for what they need. They tell you to build a project, but then no one ever shows you how they build the project. I suspect if they showed the steps, a beginner would say \"but how did you know to do that?\". It requires search skills (or you could capitulate and let the LLM do all the work, but then you're not really learning).**Staying motivated**Many beginners burn out. Or they procrastinate and play video games (or something else) or they have family issues that require their time. With no one to motivate you but yourself, many quit after a month or two. It's not fun. It's not easy. The concepts are too hard. It seems like it will take forever to do something simple. There's so much material out there.**TLDR**Many things contribute to self-teaching being a challenge.",

Asking for help finding your stupid bug didn't even seem like an option unless you spend 8 hours trying to find it yourself. On the other hand by the time LLMs came around I already had it ingrained that programming is supposed to be hard, and you're supposed to do it yourself. So I didn't use LLM at all for the first 2 years they where around.",

The beautiful thing about programming is that if you solved it, then you solved it.If you couldn't solve it all, then it means you have to break down the problem into simpler parts. Surely you can solve SOME of those parts. For the ones that you can't solve, you can look for outside help (e.g. libraries, algorithms published, etc.).",

I taught intro computer science at university level once upon a time.The feeling you are describing happens every semester with just about every student at one particular point in intro programming.So, you're not alone :check_mark_button:.In university, it's the point after we teach loops (for and while), arrays, iterating through arrays using loops, and even arrays of different types.Everyone is happy and everything is great... But then...Once we create a \"multi-dimensional array\", ie an array where each element is an array and write a nested loop to iterate through each array, no matter how smoothly I tried to guide students through it (which I always tried new things to build up to it and put significant effort into), just about everyone's' minds break and it's like they suddenly know nothing haha.Suddenly they can't even write if statements anymore. :man_facepalming:It was a problem I tried to solve so many times, but I couldn't.My theory of what happens is the following:A multi-dimensional array is effectively the first ever ACTUAL \"application\" or \"practical usage\" of computer science.Up to that point, students learn just raw mechanics (variables, conditions, loops, etc) but don't apply them to anything...It's never easy to leave the raw mechanics world and enter the world of applying your mechanics towards real-world problems.It's like your first time jumping off the high dive. It's always uncomfortable and challenging! And, that's okay!It's when you start to realize that simple logic can get complex quite quickly. Look at the code for binary search - it's extremely short yet profoundly powerful.My advice: Put your raw mechanical skills in your toolbox, stop focusing on them, and start using them.And, as always, give yourself grace and enjoy the process! :slightly_smiling_face:",

I had my biggest aha moments when my code didn't work and I spent sometimes hours debugging and understanding why things don't work. The more you struggle, the more you tell your brain this is important, so don't forget it when you eventually solve the problem. The struggle is an important part of the learning process.A resource I always recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project which focuses on web development but also teaches you problem solving. The projects are picked by the skill level you should have if you learned everything prior to the project which is great because then if you cannot do the project, you know that you need to go back and learn the topics which came prior to the project.

Don't be afraid to experiment. Play around. Break things. Fix them. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.+ Don't go looking for tutorials for everything. Learn to stand on your own feet. In that line, do a proper fundamentals course and then throw away the training wheels and start building.+ Don't give up too quickly. If you get stuck, go away. Take a break. Do something mundane, something with low brain activity. Go for a walk, go to the gym, take a shower, clean up, whatever. Then, often the answer comes by itself or if not, sleep over it.+ Don't use AI for anything other than explanations.+ Don't put a \"code first\" approach. Code is only the means to tell the computer what we want it to do. The steps before the code, the *algorithms*, the *steps by step solutions* to tasks are what really counts. Sit down with pencil and paper and go through the task. Analyze it. Break it down. Solve it *your* own way, as *you, the person* would do it. Track the steps. Then, once you have a working solution, think about how to *implement* the steps in code. Remember that you can't solve what you don't understand.+ Don't be afraid to ask questions. Yet, when asking, demonstrate your efforts in the line of \"I have researched *this*\", \"I have tried to understand *that* but am stuck at *this*\". Don't just ask \"How to do *this*\" as such questions will not be well received.+ Make the documentation of the language you are learning your best buddy. Make heavy use of it. Learn to work with it.+ Your other best buddy should be good old Dr. Google (or the search engine of your choice)+ Expect to be slow. Expect to run against obstacles. That's completely normal when learning. Only those who do not give up and conquer the obstacles (certain stubbornness is necessary here) can succeed.+ Do not look at how much you have to learn - it is a mountain that you cannot reach the summit. Look at the path, the steps ahead of you and walk one step after the other. This way, it becomes a lot more manageable and less disheartening.+ Be prepared for a lifetime of learning. You will never \"master\" anything. You will become *proficient* and you have to be satisfied with that.**Edit:** something more+ Adjust your approach to *failure*. Don't see it as something negative. It is completely normal to fail. See it as *gained experience*. You now know how not to do something. That is more than you knew before you tried it. It is equally important to know how not to do something as to know how to do something. I've added this point because way too many people despair, are frustrated, are destroyed as soon as they encounter failure and then, they instantly reconsider their choices or directly give up.",

Also, debugger can help you a lot with understanding how code flow works etc. Similarly, your IDE might make your life much easier, if you spend some time discovering its features\\- don't just fix effects of issues, but get to the bottom of them; a good programmer shouldn't just sweep issues under the rug (especially issues like regressions) but explains the root cause, so that it does not propagate further. It's a good practice overall and is good for professional development. Going back to previous point - learning how to use some non-obvious features of git, like blame, and integrating them into IDE, can make a world of difference while at it\\- keep your ego in check; there's much more to be said here, but this is an important one, especially around code reviews. There's two sides of that - one is don't take criticism of your work personally. It's very hard at first and might not be possible at all in some cases, but try to find a way to do it. Second - be kind when commenting others' code. You should point to the issues, but even you're 100% correct to point something out, do your best to use soft language and not make it inflammatory. It's should be just about communication and not making another person's day worse. There's guides on how to professionally do CRs and I recommend checking some.",

If you look at individual method in isolation they look great, but there are serious issues with side effects, global state, or implicit coupling between methods that would make this code really brittle and hard to maintain in practice.[https://qntm.org/clean](https://qntm.org/clean)I think a more charitable interpretation is that Clean Code was very relevant when it came out, but hasn't stood the test of time as well.It was written in response to a popular style of object-oriented programming at the time that was resulting in code that was extremely hard to debug and test. Clean Code had a lot of great ideas to course-correct.However, the example code could have been better chosen. A lot of the example code constructs HTML from strings, which was common at the time but seems really dated now because we all use templating libraries for that which are way cleaner and more general-purpose.In addition, the book goes into gnarly details of mocking in Java and a lot of that content is totally out-of-date today.I'd recommend this book instead:The Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code[https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293)I think it's designed to be more timeless and applies to lots of different languages and types of code.",

Naming conventions, proper separation of concerns and reducing unnecessary complexity are more important if you would ask me.",

There are some weird sideeffects to everything, and throughout the book he seems to think that sideeffects are okay as long as they happen inside the same object. That was kind of the OOP-way of thinking back then, not so much now. And while I'm certainly not a fan of methods just throwing Exceptions without explaining why or where they originated, that is more of a Java thing.But I kind of agree with you, that the entire book seems \"ugly\" - there are a lot of good suggestions in there, but then they are intertwined with crazy \"rules\" that seems made up on the spot, and the strange flow in the text and the small illustrations just makes everything seem \"messy\".",

AI can definitely serve a purpose in a developer's toolchain, but it's not going to destroy programming as a job anytime soon. I've been in the industry for almost 40 years, and the death of programming as a job has been predicted since before I started. Back in my day it was 4GLs (the book _Application Development Without Programmers_ was published in 1981)Even if it did, learning to code can help you learn to think in a more structured way. Those skills can help you in all sorts of roles where logical thinking and problem solving are important. I rarely code professionally anymore. I'm still in IT, just usually doing more strategy and research stuff, but I still tackle problems in a similar way to how I'd tackle a coding problem.**But** programming isn't for everyone. If it's not something that you enjoy, or that fits with the way you think, that's fine. There's plenty of important and rewarding jobs that don't need you to know how to code. If you don't like it, don't keep trying to force it. But don't stop simply because you think development's a dead end job.",

Get a good understanding of javascript first, and I really mean a good understanding.Software developers have a future, but expecting it to always be like it was during the peak phases in the last 10 years is unrealistic. During those times, any low-effort low-skill person with only basic knowledge could get a 6 figure job after a 10 months of starting to learn - that just isn't a realistic state to maintain. Devs who are high-skill with deep knowledge, and are also well rounded overall (social skills, emotional skills, being good in teams, other stuff that is important in basically every other field too) will always have opportunity, and they'll be in even higher demands during peak times.I don't know what I would recommend you to do. I think that anyone who is truly very interested in computers and programming will have a good career, the rest I don't know. It definitely doesn't hurt to learn. Those skills can always be used, even if just on the side.AI doesn't have a chance to take over software developers until it has the cognitive capabilities of a human - and by the time AI can do that, EVERY job is going to be replaceable so there is no reason to even worry about this. Even if AI does get to that point, you will still be better off having spent your time learning than doing nothing valuable with it instead, learning and preserverence are skills too.",

For example when I started in February 2024 learning Web development I didn't see that 7 months later I would work on a project that is now used in the company I work at. My position there is completely unrelated to software development. I also got a company price for it. I also didn't see that now I am working on an app with a buddy of mine which will become a company. This was impossible to see for me when I was coding rock paper scissors in Javascript in march 2024.If this is what you want to do then start and don't stop no matter what. If it makes you feel any better I had times in the beginning where I was close to giving up because I couldn't solve some Javascript problem and I felt very dumb and often had thoughts that this is simply not for me.

And you instantly gave up on the first obstacle. You did not seriously dive into programming. You haven't even skimmed the surface.Did you do the same when you learnt to ride a bike? Did you think \"my body is not built for riding a bike\", or did you continue to try until you got it?Did you do the same when learning to read, to write, math, etc?Why would programming be different? Learning to program, learning *problem analysis and problem solving* is a *process* that doesn't happen instantly. It is a trained and acquired skill.You gave up way too quickly.Start over with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki and this time invest some actual, serious effort and don't bail out on the first obstacle.The problem was not that you don't have the mind for coding. You didn't want to invest the effort needed to *learn*. You didn't have the determination, persistence, discipline to actually pull through difficulties.The problem is not your mind. It is your mind*set*.Read [my comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lzixwn/what_are_top_5_advices_youd_give_to_anyone_new_in/n31ze97/) and take the suggestions to heart.",

        "body": "Possible but unlikelyI've taught several hundred intro level students over 20+ years in college and I've only run into one that I think has an serious incapability akin to dyscalculia that made coding impossible for themThe sad fact is that there are a lot of prerequisites but they're all unlisted and untested and most vary on a continuum, and no one knows which they have or dont have. So everyone starts at a couple different start lines compared to their peers and have no way of comparing their progress with their peers because of itTo make it worse, too many professors assume anyone that fails an intro class \"just didn't have the programmer gene\" and write them off, which i consider incompetent teaching Everyone can be taught the basics and helped to practice the prerequisites, it just takes time. It will be harder for some than others, largely due to just starting with different skillsets Logic, the ability to abstract rule sets, the ability to concretize abstract rules into an example, the ability to strictly read or write rules, being able to hold certain amounts and types of data in one's working brain memory at once which breaks down into both being able to chunk data and also some natural mental skill higher on the scale of the magical number 7 plus or minus 2 etc etc etc it goes on and onSo yes you might be lacking, but you can also catch up, I've seen it literally hundreds of times",

Ok maybe that’s a big thing but in reality it’s a random number generator, a couple of if statements and some print lines. So how do you approach it?First you say well let’s break the game down. I make a guess, computer makes a guess, then it’s scored. Ok so how do I make a guess? I need to enter a value. I need to store that value. There’s probably some console readline function and I can assign that to a variableHow does a computer guess?Well we know we have to store the guess in the variable. And there’s 3 choices. So let’s assign each to a number. Generate a number between 1 and 3. And then say if 1 it’s rock, if 2 paper etcAnd then how do we score it?Well it’s all if statements right? So that’s some basic Boolean logic. If player= rock and computer = rock print drawIf player =rock and computer = paper print loseEtcAnd then you have a basic working game and start to tidy and optimise. It’s less about can I think like a programmer and more can I break problems down to their smallest components",

It's like I understood the concept but my mind didnt understand yet how to use those new concepts and put them together. It took a while for me to get that confidence and that switch of knowing how to actually use what I'm learning and it wasn't really one singular thing, tutorials did kind of help me, and projects DEFINITELY pushed that learning even further, but it was mainly answering programming questions and basically trying to teach everything I learned to someone or something. Obviously I wasn't good at programming, but because I was passionate about the field I would still try to answer programming questions and so I would study the concept and fact-check myself all the time, because I dont want to give the other person wrong information. Basically the Feynmann technique. It works really well for me. Just simple [rubber duck debugging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and answering questions helped me go from not understanding how to put new concepts together to being able to write code confidently. Because I was taking my time and explaining everything like I was a teacher and that helped me slow down and understand the benefits and the reasons for some of the concepts I was using like loops and functions, it opened my eyes to what I did and didnt understand. By answering programming questions I also read a lot of code that wasn't mine and that also helped me understand documentation a lot better as well teaching me how to identify good coding practices. As for when I learned to understand it all? I don't know, it took months and I have no idea when it clicked. I think a lot of it is a gradual process.

I mean, it's literally just reading through text books, and with no accountability at all. This is nowhere near the same thing as taking a course.With that said, you could slog through the text books, and then sign up for 1 semester at WGU or some other similar school, pregame a bunch of the outsourced learning when possible, and then test out of everything. This would get you a CS degree in \"a single semester,\" which basically just means it's a very cost-effective approach if you are disciplined and/or smart enough.Personally, I've taken a more organic approach of just pursuing things when I'm interested in them, and always pushing myself to dive deeper in the why behind things. It takes a lot longer, but is more fun for me. For instance, I taught myself web dev and explored that for a while, then moved onto lower-level things with C++ by making a game engine. Now I have dived deeper into embedded systems and learned to program Arm assembly. This has taught me a lot about logic gates and CPU architecture. Along the way, I have learned and practiced data structures and algorithms whenever I needed to or felt like it.Next up is either going to be learning network protocols for IoT stuff, or learning operating system design to create my own RTOS. Eventually I'll get into database design when I want to, and I think that about covers everything. At some point, I'll probably enroll in WGU or some similar school and get the degree just to make it official and pass the job filters.",

        "body": "Just a bit of a historic tangent note: Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's I only encountered the usage of \"unusual\" characters in passwords that were accessible by keyboard on one computer: The Apple ][e computer! Its OS and built in version of Basic allowed you to press CTRL characters as part of your password. --------------------------------So for example, you could type a password like: monkey123or you could type: m[CTRL-O]nkey12[CTRL-3]Both were completely different passwords. The cool thing about the Apple at that time, was that when you pressed the ctrl character as part of your password, it would do 2 things: first it would register that as an actual character of your password, and then it would next, do the function of the special control character. So if your password had the letter \"g\" and you replaced it with [CTRL-G], well first it would record CTRL-G as a keystroke as part of the password and insert that into the input. But then it would do the function of the CTRL character like ring the speaker bell, or whatever. It was quite a fun and unsual way of handling keyboard input that I don't think I ever seen since. I liked it! --------------------------------ALSO: On the IBM PC at that time, in theory there was nothing really stopping you from doing the same thing... So for example with an extended ASCII character set of 256 characters, including ctrl characters and graphics characters... You could use almost any of it for your password. But... the trouble was the way the keyboard talked to the OS MS-DOS and the BIOS, which was not the same as the way the Apple ][e would handle it. So if you pressed a CTRL character, for example, then the computer would just do the function of that ctrl character, such as ring the bell when you pressed CTRL-G, but not pass that on as an actual input character to the running program. And then as far as special graphics characters go, well the IBM keyboard had no way for you to directly type them, unlike the Commodore 64 for example, in which many of the graphics characters were displayed on the side of the keys, and could be typed with a special function key. --------------------------------Also interestingly: On the IBM PC running MS DOS back then, you could even use graphic characters in filenames which suprisingly as a kid experimenting, I found that out on my own! (None of my other computer geek friends had ever tried that, which surprised them when I showed them.) This would actually add some limited security via obscurity, helping make it a bit harder for people to poke around with your files on a floppy disk, because they could not just simply or directly open or run them by keyboard. --------------------------------ESSENTIALLY: In order to access a file back then with special graphics characters on the IBM, you'd have to write a batch file or Basic program to specifically address those unusual characters. Otherwise again there was no way to type those characters on the keyboard to do what you wanted with it. You could however still copy the files all you want using the command: copy a:*.* b: That would copy them from floppy drive a to b. So it wouldn't give you any copy protection, but still even on the next disk, you had the problem of getting to the files with a keyboard alone. --------------------------------Funny enough: All this to say is that I did use it to build in a somewhat half copy protection security and self-destruct feature! So ya: I was working on my \"big program\" at the time. It was a clone of Macpaint but on the IBM PC. I was using Basic and Assembly language. (It did some of the basic stuff of Macpaint, and visually it looked good! And you could move a pointer around with a mouse or arrow keys.) And so I didn't want my friends to \"steal\" the code (lol! As if they would!) when I gave them a copy to try on their computer. --------------------------------THUS: What I did was make all the files with special graphics characters only, except for the file which you could type to run the program. Next, one of the weird graphics character files was actually a pure text data file that just simply had a single integer. A run counter. So each time you ran the program it would just update the counter, from say, 0 to 1. And then the second time you ran it, it would update to 2, etc... When the program ran, it would check and see how many times you ran it. And if you exceeded the limit I put, it would then perform an \"Erase *.*\" on the floppy disk, and then next start a full reformat of the disk, LOL!

I don't say this just to be contrarian, but because this comparison leads to what I think is actually quite bad advice right here in this post. With spoken languages, yes, focusing on precision is a bad idea because they're usually vast, highly contextual, meaning is frequently ambiguous and it can be achieved through other means. For example, in a great many languages a question can be achieved either through the structure of a sentence. \"Am I going\" vs \"I am going\" but it can also be achieved through tone. \"I am going.\" vs \"I am going?\". We talk in language learning about something called tolerance for ambiguity, learning to accept speaking and listening without fully understanding everything, because the scale of what you need learn is vast and you're trying to actively fire up a part of your brain that will start working on what currently sounds like gibberish and start building meaning out of it. Programming *isn't like this* and, I think, one of the major mistakes learners make is thinking it is, or should be. You are correct that in programming you don't need to know everything, or understand everything. Limiting your toolset is, in fact, a strength, but you do actually have to know the pieces you're using well enough to put each after the other in a purposeful way because there is no other party trying to infer your meaning in good faith. There is only the ruthless obedience of the computer.",

I.e. the activity of writing, debugging, testing the source code became \"coding\". As a shorthand of \"source code\" a lot of people just call it \"the code\" as well. Technically, though, all of the code is code, including the \"binary code\" understood by your computer's CPU or GPU.I grew up in the 1980s and people always said \"programming\" to my recollection from 1980 until 2000. I don't think I heard people talking about \"coding\" until 2005 or thereafter.There are some colloquialisms and vocabulary that only work with the word \"code\". For example, we often say as programmers \"let me code this up\" meaning something like \"let me write a quick and dirty program for this\", or \"code autocomplete\" which means \"let the computer predict the next likely thing that you want to write\".",

And some stuff from analysis, linear algebra and trig might also help.- Do you know what is an algorithm? and I mean rigorously, not just a hunch. you need to be able to atleast surface level analyze them to explain them.- Do you know how digital electronics operate? You need just some surface level stuff, but again lot of stuff is basically impossible to explain without at-least a bit of understanding.I would recomend you read some books about the topic, my recomendations are:- \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\" by Niklaus Wirth- \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" by H.

Sussman.You don't have to read them whole (tho I recommned you do), but atleast the first halves or so of each.Going through the MIT CS101 MOOC might be worth it as well...Then you have to pick a language/enviroment and just try to teach them these concepts in it...The interesting options there are:- Scratch - Some people think it's great, I think it's difficult to teach some fundamental stuff in it and I think grade 8 student might have already outgrown it... Plus 14 year old me would probably think it's the lamest think ever- Flowgorithm - similar to scratch, better at teaching some fundamentals, but more tedious for the students- Lua - Lua is imo extremely underated as a teaching language, it's way more powerfull than the above, actually usable in the real world, plus you have a great resource in the \"Lua Reference Manual\" by Roberto Ierusalimschy, you can then throw a in library like LÖVE into the mix and have a great fun enviroment to teach in.- Pascal - Pascal is also awesome teaching language, maybe not suitable in your case, but once again way more practical, makes it very easy to teach more advanced concepts, and \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\" uses it for it's examples. Lazarus is really nice modern enviroment to learn pascal in, and once again gives the student way more real world applicable knowledge then something like Scratch.- Racket - again great teaching language, you might find it easier to teach if you are particularly mathematically inclined.- Python - it is an option, I don't particurarly like it as a teaching language, but there are some great books and is actually very practical in the real world.",

There’s a huge global system (the Domain Name System) that manages the mapping from domain names to IP addresses, and your computer relies on that system to resolve any domain names to IP addresses.URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators, are strings that can be used to specify the locations of resources. The host name portion of an URL can use a domain name or an IP address to specify a host (which might actually be more than one machine), but each scheme (the first part of the URL, e.g. `https:`, `mailto:`, etc.) has its own rules for interpreting the rest of the URL. For example, the `tel:` scheme is followed by a phone number rather than host name.There’s no real difference between accessing a machine via IP or domain name; the sending machine resolves a domain name into an IP address using DNS as part of establishing communication. The actual connection is made using the IP address. So, yes, hacking is also done using IP addresses, but no, that’s not really a basis for hacking — it’s just how internet communication works.",

        "body": "Let’s be a little more specific on what happens. IP addresses are routing addresses assigned to an internet endpoint. They work like mailing addresses and just like mailing addresses have nothing to do with whether there’s a locked door or even a building at the site. Also, just as a large building might have an internal mailroom, computers connecting to a local network like your WiFi router will have a local address behind your internet connection’s public one. They usually start with 192.168 or 10.x. These local devices cannot be reached directly unless a forwarding rule of some kind is set up. They can only receive responses to their requests and this affords them a lot of protection from attack. The DNS system is an aliasing system. You can buy or really rent with the right to renew a domain like mysite.com from a trusted registrar. They’ll have a portal where you can specify that mysite.com should direct traffic to a certain ip address or forward it to another domain. There are other entries for email addresses using that domain and several options. Browsing to the site involves using DNS to do a destination lookup and then sending traffic to the final ip. This also allows those IPs to change if needed. The second part of this is traffic encryption using a ssl cert the registrar sells you and verifies on the fly. This addresses most DNS breaches other than the authority itself because the traffic recipient must also have a copy of the cert.None of this is actually securing your computer. It’s just addressing and impersonation prevention and traffic encryption. That’s more the realm of firewalls that block suspicious traffic and anti malware that disables suspicious programs.",

It's beginner friendly and incredibly versatile. You already know what you want to do and that alone will get you far. I would stick with Python because there is little to no downsides to learning it for programming since it's easy and plus you already bought a course for it. Of course there will never be a perfect option but for learning programming and making desktop apps, Python is fine, especially if performance isn't your main goal. Which I don't believe it should be if you're a complete beginner. Focus on learning Python, as well as important programming and computer science concepts like data structures and algorithms and after that every other language will be a lot easier.",

Here’s my take:Java - if you want that corporate bag :money_bag: - Enterprise companies LOVE Java (banks, insurance, big tech) - Spring Boot is everywhere in backend roles - Salaries tend to be higher for Java devs in my experience - More structured, forces you to learn good practices early - Job security is insane - legacy systems aren’t going anywherePython - if you want flexibility and faster learning curve - Easier to pick up, more beginner-friendly syntax - Django/FastAPI are solid for backend - Great for startups and data-heavy companies - Opens doors to ML/AI if you wanna pivot later - More “fun” to work with imoReal talk though - market demand wise, Java probably has a slight edge for pure backend roles, especially for freshers. Most companies have existing Java codebases and need people to maintain them.But honestly? Pick whichever one doesn’t make you want to cry while coding. I’ve seen people succeed with both. The fundamentals (databases, APIs, system design) matter more than the language.If you’re really torn, learn Java first (it’ll make you a better programmer overall), then pick up Python later. It’s way easier to go Java → Python than the other way around.Also protip: whatever you choose, get really good at ONE framework. Don’t try to learn everything at once - you’ll just confuse yourself.Good luck with placements! :crossed_fingers:",

The sheer scale and complexity (legacy code, service variations, completely different deployment strategies between versions) made bash scripts impractical. I had to learn Ansible. The pressure drove me to pick it up in a month, become proficient by six months, and complete production migration within the year. Now I use Ansible everywhere. That's automation born from necessity.More often though, automation springs from fixing daily annoyances. I hate tracking my hours, so I built an iOS shortcut that logs my ins/outs and generates a weekly spreadsheet for my boss. When I used to distrohop on Linux, I created an Ansible dotfiles repo to streamline setups.The key is to identify what genuinely annoys you, then ask \"how would I automate this?\" The search for solutions naturally follows.",

While people who are starting new projects from scratch might be more likely to use Rust now, most existing C++ projects are not going to rewrite.Even places that use Rust for all new code use a lot of code written in other languages. Rust programs often call into libraries written in C, C++, and other languages, and sometimes you'll need to read, debug, or modify that code too. So knowing C++ is pretty useful.Another reason is that experiencing the flaws of C++ will help Rust make a lot more sense. Rust was designed in particular because it just wasn't possible to write memory-safe code in C++. There's no better way to appreciate that than to try to write C++ and to see how an error can cause your program to crash or corrupt memory, then to experience how Rust prevents that code from even compiling.",

You could then customize your home control depending on what products you actually have, like import IKEO.Table import IKEO.WindowBut not import the IKEO.Door package that you have no use for.

This means less space is taking up on disk. This really doesn't mean much for a desktop but for an embedded environment this can be very important.Additionally when you run a program the contents of the executable is loaded into memory. If you are running two GNU programs at the same time then each has to be loaded in to RAM. With the BusyBox single program only 1 copy is loaded into memory and both programs can use the same code, thus reducing memory usage. Again great for embedded environments, not so important with desktops.Since as you might have guessed people who use BusyBox don't have much disk space or memory, if you don't need some of those programs then you don't compile them into the single executable. This means the program takes less disk space AND less RAM needs to be used to hold the executable in memory.",

I used to be quite competitive during bachelor's and put a lot of effort into staying ahead, but in the masters, I just realized that having a more nuanced and focused skill set is more productive. Webdev, on its own, is oversaturated, and maybe you need to find a specific thing in your field that is special and make you really stand out. That skill might not be used to the employers but showcase that you are smart.In my case, I have a degree in ai, and I got a job offer not because they needed an AI spesielt but because they think that makes me smart(i dont know about that tho :grinning_face_with_sweat:).Someone with a deep understanding of a topic that they dont teach in uni will be better prepared for the industry than someone with good leetcode stats.",

What I’m getting at is it’s not your fault, it’s pretty overwhelming. You’re not really going to be hired for just knowing HTML/CSS/JS, so you gotta keep up and build up that skill set. But you don’t *have* to master everything, and imo uni alone was never going to get you there. At least when I did my CS major we learned almost nothing related to the field (how to make modern web or desktop apps). The real way is to learn by doing, whether that’s personal projects or an internship. Have an idea for a website, use what you know and learn what you don’t to get it there. Even if it’s bad, you’ll have learned something in the process, whether it’s connecting your react front end to a backend, figuring out web hosting, DNS records, setting up a database, etc. So don’t worry too much and just keep learning. It’ll get easier with time, and much more fun since you’ll be able to pick up new things way more quickly.",

What system you use, flowcharts, pseudocode, bulleted lists, prose description doesn't matter. Develop *your* (the person) solutions before attempting to program. This will considerably reduce the barrier.Partly the above paragraph is the reason Harvard's CS50 starts with *Scratch*, a visual programming language designed for children learning programming. It loosely resembles the graphics of \"Nassi-Shneiderman Charts\", another approach to drawing algorithms. This approach helps focusing on the actual *program*, on the *steps* to solve a problem without getting tied up in programming language syntax. Personally, I think that this is a great approach to learning programming - especially in the beginning stage.",

Explaining procedures that involve branching (\"conditions\" in non-techie speak) to non-programmers is also often done with a flowchart and \"not\" pseudocode, by the way. So in some way, flowcharts seem to be naturally are intuitive to all audiences. Personally I think it's due to the uses of little arrows that can point in whichever direction. And I think it's been shown that most humans have a sort of \"spatial memory\" of sorts, so if you're following such a diagram you can think of each box of the logic as a little room in which you are standing. Following another arrow goes to another room, and so on. Also you can add little pictures, colors, etc. to such a digram to make it more fun, if you want.However, when you're actually writing out code, a lot of people don't like to draw that much (at least I don't). If I'm thinking about how to do a problem on a whiteboard, or on paper, then I prefer \"pseudocode\".One time I \"do\" prefer a diagram, though, is whenever there's a \"state machine\" in the code, or if I'm implementing a data structure that has a natural graphical or tabular representation (e.g. lists, trees, matrices, etc.). In such a case, I like the graphical representation but I will heavily abbreviate it in writing. But in the code I will use clear labels at each state for maintainability/\"greppability\" purposes.So in summary: you should ultimately aim to learn to read/write all forms of these ways of expressing a program. The flowchart and/or pseudocode are intended to be \"programming language\" neutral and to be read by a human. You are supposed to read them and then implement it in a natural way in whatever programming language happens to be your favourite (or the one which you happen to be using).",

How you do algorithms, how you solve problems, how to be efficient, how to have a clean structure and style. After you learned with your first language you can jump into most other language pretty fast. I started with C++ and when I had to use Phython I read the documentation and boom. You really only need to learn programming once, the languages are just a tool and you switch tools for different purposes.That doesn't mean you shouldn't specialize. All languages have their own merrits but the thinking you have to do while writing stays the same. Specializing is something you should think about after learning your first few languages.And honestly with languages like Python there is not much to specialize in. But others like C++ people who are really specialized to that specific language are very valuable to some companies. But we are talking about really expert level technical knowledge of a very complicated language. It is dry and the work isn't very interesting, at least for me.My starting recommendations are:- C++I started with this one so I am biased and you need to know that you probably won't ever fully grasp everything about this language. It can do everything, it is used for everything, C is the backbone of programming. If you are good at C++ thats a real thing to be proud of and from there on you will tackle every other language. Still very hard and frustrating to learn. Some even start with C and I think thats also a really good starting point. C doesn't offer the same quality of life stuff that C++ does but that just means that tackling the hurdles that language presents really teaches you that \"logic\" that I talked about earlier. Tho I'm not sure how much that will help in real-life since you will most likely use a more user friendly language anyway. I'd say C++ offers almost the same experience while beeing way more beginner friendly.- Python If you have trouble with C++ (wich is totally fine, as I said C++ is a real challenge) Python is amazing. It is fast to learn, it is convenient and most of all Python is really really fun to start with and that is super important while learning. For real don't torture yourself with C++ too much, just switch to Python and try C++ later!2. What branch?Honestly just try out a few different things. Maybe there are projects you really want do do yourself. You could get into web development and create a cool website. You could try something simple like making Minecraft Server plugins and hosting a server.",

But also \"action\" games, mostly simple shoot'em'ups where you move a spaceship around and try to shoot or avoid oncoming enemies - and of course 2D 'grid'-games like **sokoban** and various **zelda**\\-clones.If you are not into games, and want to write something that runs purely textbased, that can also be fun and simple. Some small projects that I still occasionally enjoy are programs to convert numbers like 123 to words like \"one hundred and twenty three\", or to/from roman numerals. Also just silly little experiments with inputs and branching, like a stupid chat-bot that doesn't really understands what you are writing, but just looks for keywords.I like to think of it as being creative with LEGO bricks - you have a collection of sets, with instructions, and you've seen how you can use the bricks you have to build those sets. Now if you take all the sets apart, what else could you maybe build with the same bricks? Could you make a spaceship or a western town or a ghost train? Just having some vague idea, and trying to connect bricks will get you a long way - and the cool thing about programming is that you never run out of bricks, but you sometime have to learn just a tiny bit more (add a few more bricks to your collection) to build exactly what you want.So start with assessing your collection of \"bricks\" - what kind of problems could you solve with what you have?",

The first stuff I did wasn't coding from scratch, it was playing around with other people's code. I learned in the pre-internet times, so my first code was copied from Gardner's column in Scientific American. I also dissected the sample programs that came with QBasic on MS-DOS (and hacked out the sound so we could play it in class without the teacher noticing).The real blast was when I found a Connect Four implementation written in Pascal on a school computer. Came with a fully functioning game AI. The code was absolute arcane voodoo to me then.",

Knowing that applications, and more importantly your written scripts, can expose themselves to a specific port in your PC so that other programs may interact to your program using APIs through that port made everything connect.",

My first project was, I own a lot of movies and series a combination of DVDs, and Blu-Rays. When friends came over they would go, can I borrow this i'd love to watch it. Then maybe 2 weeks to a month later I would get it back. I didn't mind this, but my memory is bad due to an illness, bad enough that I have purchased a movie twice before, because I thought I had lost it only to get it back from a friend later. So I made an app in PHP + MySQL database my preferred language to keep track of my movies, what medium it was DVD or Blu-Rays, actors/actresses, directors and whether it was lend out or not, and who borrowed it from me. Later I found jreklund/php4dvd on Github. It's much much better than what I did, with IMDB integration and a fancy layout with covers and all. But I still appreciate what I learned making my own.Another project I made was my own version of [https://pinboard.in/](https://pinboard.in/) Both of these is something I made to use myself. I did share my movie database thing on Github because I made it before I was aware of php4dvd.I haven't put the bookmarks PHP script on Github because why would I when something like Pinboard exists. I easily could I think, I am honestly not sure, I just tried to code and replicate the features to have something to do, to keep coding and remembering PHP. If I don't code for a while I get very rusty, do we all do that?Anything I make that I think might be useful i put on repositories like Github or Bitbucket with a GPL open source license. If people find what I have made useful, I would really enjoy that. If I made something people can learn from by reading the code even better. And I just like the GPL idea, from enjoying Open source in general and using Linux.I hope some of this is useful to you.",

Was playing this online game that let you make your own servers and script your own stuff.It was all JavaScript, basically, but I just played around. Saw what worked, what didn't. Saw something and thought \"ok how can I make that?\" And gave it a spin.Circumstances in life enabled me to abandon programming/coding for many years, but then I started doing it on my breaks in a call center job. I went through some python tutorials but really found better success just using REPL and playing with stuff trying to take things from my brain and bring them to life.I think once you have a decent idea of data types and structures, and at least a rough idea of how you might approach certain things (whether it's the right or best way doesn't matter), you get more value diving in.I got a job working on a team building stuff in PowerFX (low-code) but have integrated Python and TypeScript as well to do different things and am working on some projects to build up some confidence to eventually move up my pay scale (either at same company or elsewhere).As a side project I'm starting my first foray into Kotlin to build an Android app. I did a few free things on codecademy and instantly was bored. Instead, I decided the approach that would be better is to open the docs, dog through the sample project to see how some things interact, and just dive in.After 3 days (about 45-60min daily) I'm getting an idea of how things interact, and tonight I'm just gonna start coding and see what happens.Typing this, I've actually learned most things in life this way. Working on cars, doing things around the house. Just have something you can reference to figure out why something works or doesn't work, you can do the rest.",

You want to be confident about what you know, and know well. If you don't know .NET well enough for this job now, you won't learn enough in a week, and you risk picking up some shallow knowledge that you can't back up which will make you look like you're bluffing. You're applying for a junior position, that *should* mean they're not looking for direct working experience. They want to know that you can code, that you aren't lost as soon as you're pushed on something, and that you'll be able to do the *kinds* of work they do if not the specifics. If they set you a technical challenge of some kind, just don't overthink it. Break it down to its simplest form and write it one step at a time. At the end of the day, being able to explain what you're trying to do and why is often more important than succeeding at the challenge. They want to know you can be taught, not that you know everything already.",

They might just want to know how you would break down a problem and see what your thought process is or give you some code and just ask what you think it's doing.If you know Java already, then the jump to C# isn't bad. The way you tackle a problem is very similar if not the same. The languages just give you a couple of different tools to do it but in my experience, my strategy for tackling a problem would be similar whether I did it in Java or C#.One thing I'd offer as advice is that if you're asked to solve a problem and you get stuck, think out loud. Tell them what you know, what you think you know, what you're trying to figure out, etc. It's easier for them to evaluate if they know what you're trying to figure out and they might even ask you some questions that might trigger something to help you solve the problem. You're not expected to know everything but if they feel that you're teachable then you might be what they're looking for.",

        "body": "Start going to hackathons in your town. Particularly at universities. Show up, join a team, and build a solution in 48 hours with your team, and present it to the judges. There are a few benefits of this approach: 1) It raises the stakes. Suddenly, you're not just completing an exercise to get some course's Certificate Of Completion. Suddenly, there are prizes involved, and team mates who rely on you (and who you rely on). It makes it much more exciting. As a result, you'll be driven to learn things you wouldn't have expected to, and end up with a richer learning experience. 2) It will boost your confidence. You might be competing against people doing PhDs. And you'll suddenly realise that even though you're 14, your project is could still beat theirs (and in some competitions, it will). 3) It's the most fun learning environment. The real purpose of going to a hackathon is to learn a new skill. Often, hackathons are sponsored by someone who has invented a new technology of some sort and who wants to promote it among the software community. By doing a hackathon and learning that skill, you become among the first one in your town who gets experience with it, and you find that a few months to a year later, there are job ads for someone who knows that skill (and of course, no applicant does). Knowing the newest technology gives your IT projects a big advantage, because new technologies tend to make your projects better. Hope that's useful. Good luck!",

They last only a day or so, which isn’t enough time to become intimately familiar with even the simplest technologies. New programmers may not even realize that they haven’t even been exposed to the difficult parts of programming yet—architecture, scaling, and maintenance. Hackathons will not expose any of those issues.In short, a hackathon is no better than spending a comparable amount of time on a personal project, but with the added bonus of a cash prize (or similar).",

Now, take it to the next level. Add a multiplier that can be bought for X clicks, and add more multipliers to the shop. Add a rebirth option for 1,000,000 clicks. Add a automatic clicker that farms clicks for the user, Etc.

Hope you like Vim or Nano!* Some languages are going to be a lot less fun than others. I had a Scala class, and lemme tell ya, `sbt` is really, really slow on a Chromebook. C++ can also be brutally slow to compile.* If you have a desktop machine of any kind at home, you will really appreciate the ability to `ssh` into that machine to compile larger things.* Back when I was using it, Crostini had a ton of subtle, annoying bugs in it that made the system kinda unstable. It wasn't particularly fun, and I finally ended up installing custom firmware on it so that I could put a mainstream Linux distribution on it.* My particular model of Chromebook was really poorly supported by the upstream Linux kernel for a long time and required a patched kernel to get things like the keyboard and touchpad to work properly. This sucked.",

While Python is great at data-wrangling scripts and ML, it's a fairly sub-optimal for enterprise applications due to lower runtime performance and no support for data encapsulation. C++ is blazingly fast for compute-intensive algorithms thanks to your ability to allocate just as much memory as you need on the page-level, but I'd rather shoot myself in the foot than build applications with very high IO throughput. But whatever you choose to start with, **do not start with JavaScript.**",

Like be able to write it in your sleep down cold.Then work your way up bit by bit to make more and more complex projects, writing it all from scratch. Alternate that with trying to really thoroughly understand the more advanced concepts in your language of choice. It'll take time - probably a lot of it - but move slow and learn it all thoroughly.I think most of the time when folks get stuck like this it is because they moved faster than they learned, and ended up creating things without mastering the fundamentals.

Explain exactly where you're stuck as best you can, so the AI can help you better.Then, when it doesn't work, go to Reddit and ask r/learnjavascript , there's lots of posts people make whenever they get stuck there as well. Also try your best to explain what's confusing you, and explain if you need a metaphor or analogy to understand it, or if there's just 5 parts to a snippet of code that you need broken down and explained better.",

If you're able to handle yourself during an interview, your chances grow dramatically. You don't need to know all the answers, but it's important to communicate honestly about what you know and don't, and to seem like a good addition to the team. It's a very good idea to, for example, instead of saying \"I don't know.\" say \"I'm not that familiar with this right now, but I'm actually very interested to find out more about it first thing on the project\" etc. Be able to say basic stuff about most reasonable areas during the interview, even if it seems trivial (like, if you've only heard a few words about contexts in react, do say it's a way to pass data between components, but you had no chance to use them yet and you're very interested to become more familiar with them the first chance you get). Don't expect to do too well during your first interview either. Don't sweat about any practical challenges either, I've been mostly interviewing senior engineers for the last couple of years and you'd never believe me how they generally struggle with relatively simple coding tasks. If you need some more help feel free to reach out, in some future I'm interested in potentially reaching out for help from some junior devs in Poland, so I'll save your post too.",

The work inside the loop is the important part.Generally, if a problem requires that you do something a specific number of times, use a for loop. If it requires that you do something an unknown number of times but until a certain condition is satisfied, use a while loop. If you want at least one iteration always, use a do...while.There's the SSI way of viewing programming languages if it's helpful to you:Statements: These do work. (e.g. `return a + b * c;`)Selection: These select which work to do. (e.g. `if, switch, ternary`)Iteration: These repeat work. (e.g. `for, while, do while` )",

For loop expression has three parts for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { //this part gets executed 10 times }The first `int i = 0` is what gets executed once before the loop starts. The second one `i < 10` gets executed before every loop iteration, and terminates the loop if it evaluates to false. The third one `i++` executes after every loop iteration. Exactly the same code can be written as int i = 0; while (i < 10) { //this part gets executed 10 times i++; }It should be fairly easy to understand how this works. The for loop just saves you two lines of vertical space by allowing you to put your code for initializing your iterator and incrementing it into the same place as loop condition.",

Obviously, the more you know - the more you have had experience with - the better you can be at knowing approaches to take - what is possible, for example. There is \"knowledge in the world\" and \"knowledge in your head\". There's a ton of knowledge out there, and it's impossible to have it all in your head. Plus what you need to know changes over time, with different jobs, different projects, different situations.If you sit me down with a task, I will probably not know the approach to take straight away. But I'll be able to not only work out the approach but also implement it. That is what you do day in and day out in a software development job, at least if you're not just cranking the same code out over and over.The \"always manage to screw up in the end\" is the part to work on. Figure out how you screwed up and take that forward by not doing it again. They say an expert is just someone who has already made all the mistakes. Every mistake you make - if you learn from it - is a step along the path to becoming an expert. :)",

As a result, I can fill the niche of someone who can do both the design and implementation of industrial controls as well as all the analytics work and modeling. One of my more recent self directed projects(company gives out bonuses for lean/Six Sigma work if it saves time or money) was implementing a machine learning vision QC system because I was annoyed that they kept bringing up materials waste and false failures as well as false passes at meetings without anyone coming up with real solutions.Wasn't too tricky because it leveraged both of my fields of knowledge - with vision stuff being a core part of automation engineering and ML being a core part of data science. I 'acquired' some high definition cameras from the stock room because it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission and set up a test station to work with. Stupid thing was the company already had some kind of setup like this but it was automatically failing everything and they didn't know how to fix it, so I wasn't working from scratch and had a *lot* of data on hand to work with.The current process as of 9 months ago now is that instead of each part being inspected manually with microscopes, which is slow and has a lot of human flaws due to the product being high grade optical gear, it gets placed in a fixture, the operator presses a button to activate the program which then snaps a photo and scans it for flaws, highlights anything outside of spec which is then passed on to a quality technician, and is otherwise cleared for use down the line. The machine learning aspect mostly applies to parts that are less easily measurable by humans. I can't really go into more details.My boss thinks I'm highly motivated and hard working but mostly I'm just easily bored and irritable.",

I have a bafflingly wide variety of skillsets just because my first job after graduation required me to learn how to fix stuff as an electrical technician in a factory. Came out of school knowing the bare basics of PLCs, electronics, and robotics. Then suddenly I had to learn how machinery worked and interacted with other sections, service lasers, look at code far more complex than anything I'd ever seen before, solve physical problems without actual pre-determined solutions, reprogram stuff completely outside of my realm of expertise(like vision QC) because there were no engineers on my shift at night. A lot of the time it really sucked but the mindset I was able to form out of it, which is to say being able to take a wide overview and draw on many different areas to look for solutions to problems, has been invaluable. Some of the stuff was much older than me, basically nothing was uniform, and a bunch of the programming was in German. I do not speak German. Actually only met several of the engineers at the current gig because while I was testing out some equipment I overheard them complaining about a camera system we had for measuring extreme temperature variance on the products and how the guy who does it is on vacation. Poked my head in and went \"oh hey you guys are looking at Cognex? I know how that stuff works\" because at my first job I had needed to configure a ton of them and work within the software more than a few times.

It allows for the lower level control of C but the ability to do higher level programming. The performance is a plus. I’ll get into Python again when I give into AI/ML and GPU programming.

Three reasons:1. Language similarities: JavaScript works similarly to Python. You don't need a compiler to convert it into binary machine code, you just write it and press run. Like Python, it's also a dynamically typed language:. //valid JavaScript code var x = 5; x = true; x = \"hello\";Other languages, like C# and Java are *statically typed* languages, which means you'd have to do this instead: //valid Java code //x can only be set to int values int x = 5; //b can only be set to true/false boolean b = true; //s can only be set to null or a String String s = \"hello\"; //Object can be set to anything Object anything = null; anything = 5; anything = true; anything = \"hello\";This is one of the main differences between Python/JavaScript vs C#, Java, and other statically typed languages.Continuing my comment in a reply to myself down below",

Laravel uses PHP, so even though I wasn't a big fan of PHP syntax, I learned to work with it. In your case, if you want to build a 2D game, is Pygame enough for you? If so, stick with Python since you already know it. If not, what tool would be best for your project? If Unity seems like a good fit, it's time to learn C#.",

I should be doing it right now instead of writing this, but I need a break from all the documents I'm currently reading.Software engineering moves quickly. Things change daily.

Yesterday I was looking into some errors with third party software. Tomorrow I'll be learning something else. That's the job. Or at least a large part of it. People think writing software is mainly typing. It is. If you're a programmer. If you're a software engineer then the job is research, learning, thinking, designing. Then 20 minutes of typing. Be a software engineer.As an aside. If you're trying to learn something like cancellation tokens then spend a few hours designing your own cancellation token. How would you do it if someone asked you to? It's actually not that hard. I mean it is, but the basics are fairly simple. Designing it to production level quality is significantly harder. But you don't need to do that to learn the raw basics.If I had a junior engineer who \"wasted\" a morning building their own basic cancellation system to learn how it works I would be impressed. And I'd give them the slightly more complex work to do and nudge them in the right direction. As a junior your current job is to learn. Not write software. You can write software once you've learned how. Part of that is writing software to gain experience. But all of the job is learning. You're not currently productive enough to be useful. You will be. But your job isn't to be productive yet. It's to learn to be productive.",

If there's no interesting problems that you want to solve, how about a game?In high school when we were learning c++ we made a number guessing game. The rules of the game are as follows: 1. Generate a random number from 1 to 100 (or whatever range you prefer) 2. Prompt the user for a number guess3. Read user input 4. Convert user input to a number so you can compare it to your secret number5. Tell the user whether their guess is higher or lower than the secret number6. Loop steps 2-5 until the number is guessed, and then exit the loop and print a victory messageIt might not sound the most exciting, but practice is good even for simple ideas. Games can be an engaging way to learn. They can also get way more complex than most \"real\" software for business. If you try making a few simple games and then go for something more complex (maybe use the ebiten engine to get some 2d graphics) you'll become vastly more skilled.That is similar to my path, except I had Java 7(?) with basic swing graphics and later lwjgl engine. I love go now, though! It's not the best option for building a game client, but it's fun to work with. It is better suited to making a game server. For your learning purposes, it should be perfectly fine.",

Are you looking for work and think it won't fit in? Want to work alongside others and worry your code will be hard to read or poor, or is it primarily just a feeling you're doing something wrong? It sounds like this is mostly personal projects for your own satisfaction? If that's the case, looking into other ways of structuring code and principles can be fun and interesting, but at the end of the day, you're the boss. If the way you're working has fundamental issues affecting how your program works, you'll find out for sure when it either breaks or becomes impossilble to work with. And then you've got something clear and direct that isn't working to learn from.It's hard to learn from an abstract sense of what you should and shouldn't do.",

Not to hate or anything, I love the Cherno, but he goes really hard on the code reviews and it makes me uneasy about my code.There seems to be a lot of debate in the C++ community and some prolific folks that are really adamant on a certain style being correct and everyone else is a fake C++ programmer (hell even Bjarne lays out a very specific way in which he thinks C++ should be programmed in all of his books but even that is now labeled as wrong).

If you haven’t dug around a well maintained Shadcn/UI project on GitHub I recommend you do so.Oh also having to look up documentation/cheat sheet… have you installed the tailwind extension in VS Code?

It will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right?Correct, dereferencing a pointer after the end of the lifetime of the object it points to is [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and technically, the program is allowed to do absolutely anything from that point on.This doesn't just apply to memory allocated with `malloc`. It also applies to local variables, whose lifetime ends when at the end of the corresponding function or block.> Is there any downside to always using this macro, rather than always writing 2 lines manually?Well, the C preprocessor is just a dumb text substitution engine. So in terms of the compiled code, using your macro is exactly the same as writing the statements directly. (The [`do { ... } while (0)` construct](https://c-faq.com/cpp/multistmt.html) is a trick to make the macro behave correctly as though it were a single statement.)The biggest issue I have with your macro is that the name is misleading. It's not really \"safe\" because it doesn't prevent the underlying problem. In particular, if you ever pass around copies of a pointer (which is common) then just setting one copy to `NULL` doesn't affect the other copies. So if you're uncertain whether an object has been freed, then checking whether the pointer is `NULL` is not reliable on its own, unless you also know that nowhere else in your program is calling `free` on a copy of the pointer.And likewise, calling `SAFE_FREE` on a local pointer variable is not *necessary* when the pointer variable is going out of scope. If the variable is disappearing, it doesn't matter whether you set it to `NULL`. (In fact, the compiler would probably optimize out the assignment statement.)If I were reading your code and I saw something like `SAFE_FREE`, I would have to look up the macro definition anyway to see what it was actually doing in terms of memory management. Writing `free(ptr); ptr = NULL;` directly is clearer, in my opinion.In general, C is a language that *demands* you constantly pay attention to memory management at all times. This is just a habit you need to develop. Other languages provide better tools to assist you with this. For instance, C++ has \"smart pointers\" that act as an abstraction layer above regular pointers. The smart pointer is responsible for knowing when it's safe to call `free` on the underlying pointer.",

You are correct. If you incorrectly try to resuse something that you alread \"freed\" then there is no rule that says that your program will crash. It is however undefined behaviour, so the technique you are quoting here is a fine one, and many programmers do that. It is a well-known technique that is commonly used, which is probably the reason the LLM is giving it to you as if it is something special.As mentioned elsewhere, the benefit of using a macro here is perhaps slim to none. When I've seen this done in code, it's normally just done without a macro, by using an explicit assignment of NULL to the pointer after the deallocation is done. free(my_ptr); my_ptr = NULL;The same thing is done when programming in C++, when using new and delete (many C++ programmers will assign the pointer a value of NULL or nullptr after delete'ing it).Clearly, setting the pointer to a value of NULL should not be needed, but the reason it's considered \"safer\" is because it \"almost guarantees\" the behaviour later if you do make a mistake and try to reuse that pointer. For example, if you \"accidentally\" call free again on that pointer again down the line (I don't know why you would), then free is guaranteed to do nothing in that case.The more important mistake that you want to catch is if your code accidentally deferences that pointer later on as if it were still pointing to valid data. If it's a NULL pointer (because you are using the \"safe\" technique\"), then on all systems I've seen, dereferencing the NULL pointer will crash the program. Formally speaking, though, derefencing a NULL pointer is either undefined behaviour or \"implementation defined\". But for all practical purposes, you can rely on a derefence of NULL being a fatal event on most systems (at least on all Desktop systems). It's a bit funny that we consider crashing the program to be \"safer\" than not crashing, but it turns out it's much easier to debug a crash caused by a null pointer dereference (i.e. \"segmentation fault\" on Linux) than it would be to debug accidentally dereferencing a \"stale\" pointer that was pointing to some old data.",

In the second SAFE\\_FREE, you're setting the passed pointer to NULL, and it goes away as well. The pointer that matters is the outer pointer, which is *not* set to NULL.I'd say that, unless you're legitimately writing lots of free/nulling pairs, the macro is not only going to not help, but it's going to give a false sense of security. You need to set pointers to NULL in a meaningful way, and that often means NULLing them some place besides where the *physical* free takes place, happening more where the *logical* free is occurring (e.g. destroyFoo being the logical destruction point).Only you can say whether it will help you or not. It may be a less verbose approach. But I wouldn't consider it a *safer* option if it stops you from actually thinking about who is owning memory and making sure that state is handled consistently, not just looking locally at the point where the actual memory freeing occurs.Edit: if you had a function like destroyFoo, you could make it take a Foo\\*\\* (pointer to the pointer) and then NULL the outer pointer out at the end. That just pushes it up a level though. You'd still have to be careful to apply it to the primary held pointer and not some copy of it.",

In C everything is passed by value, so if I pass a pointer to a function and set it to NULL later down the same scope it was called in, the function won't see it.I guess this can be overcome by passing pointers to pointers instead of just pointers? Changing all my methods that have \\* parameters to \\*\\*? Or is this messy and not good practice, and I should just learn to be vigilant to make sure I'm not using any pointer after calling free on it and setting it to NULL?",

        "body": "I think that learning python is a journey. No one course or class will get you to mastery of python. I have seen many students believing that doing a course gets them there. I think going through some beginners books or courses like you do is certainly a good start. I like this book which is available on GitHub for free and you can work on it directly in Colab: [https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)going through some texts gives you \"muscle memory\" and usually helps. Once you have done the course and worked through a book, it should be much easier to see where you are going. Especially for Python there are lots of great resources. When people speak about \"advanced Python\" it is not a specific course, but rather some ideas/concepts/approaches that you do not see in a beginners course. These could include iterators and generators (e.g. yield), decorators and content managers (with, wraps), typing and packaging (type hints, virtual environments, concurrency (async, await), metaprogramming (metaclasses, \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_, descriptors), performance and memory (profiling, understanding how NumPy works).I think that consistency is important. It is a matter of working 1-2 hours every day. After 3 months you should be at a good beginner level. 9-12 months might get you closer to being ready for a job. Of course, everybody is different and times depend on the individual. Using AI to help explain code or comment on your code. If you use it wisely it can act as a personal tutor. (It can also solve most of the beginner exercises, but then you don't learn much.) There is also material you should learn like a web framework, databases, testing (pytest) , git, docker, basic deployment. I would think of this as an ongoing task. There is much to learn and you should continuously expand your skillset. In fact there is so much that each software engineer or programmer develops a rather individual profile as you cannot learn everything. For a new project you might need to learn a new tool or a new skill, which is why after many years you become a more rounded programmer. By the way, it turns out that employers often like experienced programmers at a level that early graduates/beginners can hardly achieve. It is a good idea to work on many different projects of your own, and put them on GitHub to develop a portfolio of projects and skills to show off. This is a great way to learn and show off what you have achieved.",

        "body": "C++ is around but it has changed a lot since then, it might be unrecognizable. Look up C++11 . There's been C++14, C++17, etc standards too. Programming is simultaneously easier and harder. It's easier because the newer languages like Python and Javascript are easier to get productive in and easier to learn. It's harder because it doesn't punish bad coding habits so your projects can become hard to maintain. Also there are a lot more frameworks and libraries to learn if you want to build bigger apps. The frameworks make coding easier because you they abstract away implementation details, but there are so many around that it can become overwhelming. There's also more online development platforms nowadays, so you can start to learn coding online without installing anything on your machine. The barrier to entry is very low, but the skill ceiling is very high. I would say if you want to dip your toe in, go with python or javascript. Javascript is better for web programming, and python is better for general automation and machine learning. Or you could even dip your toes back into C++. Online compiler/editor to try out a few coding languages: [https://www.onlinegdb.com/](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) This one is for python, check out a youtube video on it. It's very useful: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)",

If you're into lower-level stuff, Rust is a really popular one. Newer language but has a lot of momentum. Definitely recommend.

Every time a manager schedules a one on one meeting with me, I'm nervous that this is it and they finally figured out that I'm dumb.The thing is, though, that to be a good programmer, you have to get really comfortable with not knowing stuff. People naturally get very defensive about not knowing things, but learning about any one thing takes time. For a programmer, there are far too many things to know about any given situation, so your time to learn things is always very limited. You have to budget. \"Do I need to know more about how this platform works, or do I need to know how this one library works, or do I need to know how HTTP is meant to handle this, or do I need to learn how to use that new AI thingy to debug this, or...\" You have to pick. That means you have to get comfortable not knowing some things and planning out what you need to learn.The more senior you are, the more this is true. You'll eventually need to start delegating work to others, and the whole point of that is that you don't need to come completely up to speed on all of the details of what they're doing. And in meetings, the new kids will have even worse imposter syndrome than you do, and they'll never want to admit they don't know something, so it's your job as the senior engineer to ask clarifying questions, sometimes even when you know the answer, even if you think it'll make you look dumb, to make sure the junior devs don't have to ask on their own.Some developers solve the imposter syndrome by cultivating a giant ego. \"I can't be an imposter; I'm a programming god, a 10x hax0r, I look down on fools who use (vi or emacs) instead of (emacs or vi).\" Don't become that guy. Just get comfortable with feeling a little like an imposter.",

If you get lucky, the boss will understand the value of custom solutions and you might cause a new role to be created at the company where you identify something that is difficult to do with spreadsheets and give them a proper database solution.For example - I heard from an associate in the medical industry that there were some old documents they needed to reconcile. Data was spread across multiple pages and they were tasked with building 1 unified document by cross referencing names and other data between the documents. I offered my scripting knowledge and we figured something out that did all of the work in a few seconds - for a task estimated to take many weeks of man hours.But bosses can be resistant to change or stubborn or complacent with how things are.

At least consider this.And don't waste a lot of time on lua. It's OK for concepts, but if you want to develop programs for people you need to learn C# for Windows users, or maybe python.",

(you've introduced a very slight bias by using mod rather than a number generator that properly produces from a range in the correct proportions) Thirdly, try to separate the responsibilities of your code. as it is you've mixed what you want displayed with the business logic of generating the cpu's guess and with printing out things. ideally you'd likely do these separately so that you can test or change them independently. so you'd have a function that evaluates who won based on the two selections. that allows that function to operate (or be tested) without randomness to ensure it's correct. Similarly by separating the prints from the evaluation you could check you get the correct message by feeding the function the game result. This would also enable you to reuse the same logic for PvP and PvCPU by just swapping how each player's move is generated rather than having to modify the entire function. fourthly, you probably want to use std:: flush or std::endl In a couple places to make sure the buffer gets flushed. Otherwise it's possible the user is left there with a blank screen because the flush isn't neccesarily triggered. overall though it's challenging to say too much since it at the end of the day works, and that's the main thing. plus it's quite short and a constrained scope so some of the stuff about testing is probably overkill.",

This won't work for you, because your frontend will be served from `something.github.io` and it will need to make API requests to `somethingelse.vercel.app`.In order to get around this, you will need to use the appropriate [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) headers on your backend. This is how your backend tells the browser that it is \"opting in\" to receiving requests that are triggered by your frontend domain. However, if your app handles any private information (including authentication credentials) then you need to be very careful with this. Make sure you're only allowing the access that you want to, from the domains that you intend to. There are a lot of terrible tutorials that will tell you to use headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` which is very insecure in a lot of cases.(The same-origin policy won't affect things like cron jobs that are making requests to your backend directly. It only affects browsers, because it affects the situation where a browser is making requests *on behalf* of a user, initiated by domain A, and sending/receiving data to domain B. The policy is needed to prevent the browser from accidentally compromising the user's data in situations where either domain A or domain B is untrustworthy.)",

I had a guy sat at the same table in a Beni Hana's, got into a conversation, mentioned I was a software engineer, and ended up working for him for a short time.Money rained from the sky. Almost literally. Investors would BEG to invest in a startup.I almost feel as though this is payback for the working class having it good for a time. Having power. Back then we had power in salary negotiations. Recruiters calling for real jobs.That's what I miss. The belief that workers were valuable and you had to work to get the good ones.",

Within 2 weeks of having it on it on my linkedin I was getting offers from factories all over for conveyor/sorter programming. It's obviously a very different job than traditional SWE as my day started in the maintenance \"crib\" with a bunch of physical laborers, talking about what areas of the facility need work and adjustment. But I would walk around with my laptop on a sling hooking up to conveyors and scanners, checking read rates and making adjustments to timings based on failing motors or air pneumatics. It felt good to see direct influence from the changes and the goal was simply to keep the facility running which felt really gratifying.",

Off the top of my head:\\- Very similar kind of job, different application field: PLC. Someone has already mentioned it, and I think is worth looking at it.\\- Architect. It comes in two flawors: IT architect in the stile of Amazon / Azure. Basically is a more experienced developer. Not sure if that is what you want. But for someone that is fresh of programming should be easy to get the certifications. There is the second flawor, which is Enterprise Architect. Keyword here TOGAF certification. Good career prospect in big corporations that have to enforce standards across various department and keep in the IT (and shadow IT) in check. Very little, if no, programming in this case.\\- IT Service Manager. Basically the guy that ensure that the IT landscape is up and running in an economical way. Keword ITIL certification. Very little, if no programming here.\\- DevOps. Still a good portion of programming, but more focused on scripting and testing. \\- Legal for IT. This probably would require more than a simple certification. But there is a lot (I mean a lot) of request of people with IT skills and knowledge of the legal aspects associated to contracts, licenses, privacy aspects and their implications. Probably a bachelor may be required to work in this field. No programming needed to do this job though. In any of the previous companies I have worked for (all big corporations), this was usually a very very difficult position to fill.\\- Security expert. Keyword ISC square certificate. Is a mix of enforcing standard guidelines for cyber security in big corporations and cyber response. Probably would require a good deal of reskilling, but getting an entry job in this field should not be impossible.Last but not least. Get your burnout in check! Good luck for everything",

        "body": "If you want to leverage your background in software you could: - go into QA. The kind of QA where you develop software to test the main system but that software never gets released elsewhere. Tools that do test setup, stress tests, volume tests, etc. This isn’t necessarily a forever job but one that will let you reset. - find a field far divorced from what you’ve done; if you were in banking go work at a transportation company; different problem set; different vibe. ————Ask yourself what you really mean when you say your ‘work is disappearing into the void’. Describe out loud or in writing where you’d want your work to appear: I would: - loved to have worked on developing the iPhone- been responsible for part of SpaceX program - written the program that detected fraud or cyber attacks - …Now ask yourself what you like doing and whether there is a need for software in that industry. Another thing is to take a few weeks off and then look back at what went wrong at your old job. Write down phrases that capture the culture or how you felt: - too many impossible deadlines- always picking up for other people’s delays and mistakes - sales over promised features; they got the bonus but we got the work - all the tech was over ten years old - no one would embrace new ideas - always got blame if something went wrong but never got credit for all the things that went rightNow ask - what could you have done differently. This is a great opportunity to learn from your mistakes. —————-Personal recommendation regarding getting laid off after all those years: take some time. Add up all the weeks, days, months you worked rather than taking vacation. You’re long overdue. Take a few weeks to disconnect. But first - let a few industry contacts know that you’re available but will be out of touch for 2-3 weeks. You’ll reach out when you return. Of course, you can time the emails release when you’re about to return as well. Just don’t burden yourself with job hunting and interviews while you’re decompressing and handling the change. My best idea for disconnecting was camping around an area I’d never visited. Left the phone in the car so I didn’t look at it all day. Did some fishing, swimming, hiking. Lots of physical activity - very little mental activity. Before you start to feel guilty that you’re not chasing the next thing immediately you should realize that you’re:A) still thinking about the old jobB) stressed out & might leave a poor impression C) dealing with some financial uncertainty All of these are stressors that could affect your demeanor during an interview. ——————-Now that you’re back put together your search plan: 1. Who do you let know you’re available 2. What type of work/environment do you want 3. Has your experience changed the relative importance of ‘things I want in a job’? —- some people realize that stability is far more important to them than they realized—- others see this as breaking chains that held them to a location 4. Consider doing some short term tech consulting - not necessarily programming. During one break I did network installation once the wires were pulled; I did database maintenance and reorganization; did some sys admin cleanup work. Things that were tech related but not development. I always found lots of little things that organizations never got around to that had big impact. Did a full database backupRan the purge routine for old data Re-orged the database Rebuilt the indexes Suddenly the system is 10x faster. Customer was happy; salesman was happier. ——————————————————Set up your daily schedule: 1. Manage list of current jobs being pursued2. Identify new opportunities3. Network with people about the jobs listed in both 1 and 2. 4. Network with people ‘without asking for a job’; just catching up; things have changed; just talking to people while i figure out what’s next; …. Let them suggest others to speak with & prompt them 5. Get some exercise; burn off tension; 6. Take advantage of any programs whether financial or search related ( unemployment insurance, job placement boards ) ————————-WRT wanting out of tech: Think about leveraging your way out. Had a colleague who worked to develop a risk management system for derivative trading. In doing so he learned as much about derivatives as any of the traders. Got an interview and got hired as a trader at a smaller firm. So have you developed any non-programming skills while developing a system? Anything in which you’re interested and can be competitive? Would you want to run a small consulting firm? Lots of other things required other than software development: marketing, sales, contract negotiation, project management, resource management, payroll and other admin. Frankly the repetitiveness of that caused me to dislike that role so I hired someone to run the firm. What’s your personality like? Could you do software sales? Or software sales support? Often ex-developers are an asset to a sales organization because they are more believable due to their experience ( and they tend to tell the truth about what’s possible and what’s not). ——————Best of luck.",

Leetcode becomes the gateway through which developers must pass, similar to the CPA exams for accountants or the bar exam for lawyers. Regulation would take this de facto regulation away from leetcode and companies and make it the responsibility of an industry body. The pros would be never having to sit these leetcode test during interviews - if your accreditation is up to date then you are a software developer. The term \"software developer\" might actually carry some weight.",

They are trying to kill OpenAI in a war of attrition and stagnate progress in the AI arms race so that they can catch up and inherit everything OpenAI would’ve been developing. To preface this, meta is notorious for poaching talent from competitors just to have them do nothing of consequence. They literally pay people to not work for their competitors. This happened a bunch during Covid in the metaverse era. It happened a bunch more before then as well when hiring was cheap. Hear me out. Meta is poaching all the top talent responsible for the creation of all the top of the line benchmark models and techniques from OpenAI. What do you do with all these people? I don’t legitimately believe that they will achieve anything more than what OpenAI and Google have already managed to achieve. I definitely don’t think their progress will be faster. There’s a limit to how many top people can work concurrently towards a goal. Not going to allege these people have an ego, but a kitchen full of chefs will not operate properly. You need some dishwashers and floor cleaners as well. All of these are chefs.Furthermore, $100M salary is literally more than most pro athletes will ever touch. I can only think that Meta anticipates these people will take the money and eventually retire. These outrageous salary figures don’t make sense for employees a corporate setting. Corporate budgets are lowkey designed so that people will keep working and spending money and work harder so they can spend more money. Paying that high of a salary in a few years is beyond effective to incentivize people to keep working. People will call it a career after they retire with handfuls of millions, let alone hundreds of millions.It might seem outlandish what I am alleging, but none of meta’s moves make sense without ulterior motives in my perspective. OpenAI is burning money at an alarming rate, still not profitable as a software company, and can’t keep researchers as they transition from a non-profit research org to a traditional corporate hierarchy. OpenAI is nothing without its researchers. This is a perfect time for Meta to try to accelerate OpenAI’s spiral into bankruptcy.TLDR; I am alleging that Zuck is paying insane salaries for this AI superteam to basically not work for his biggest foes (OpenAI and Google), and then basically have them retire or lay them off. Furthermore, he is ok if they don’t produce anything consequential because what he gains from his competitors dying (mainly OpenAI) is far beyond what he’s paying this superteam.",

I had one team member who was technically excellent but quite a bad team player and clearly didn’t meet certain Netflix values. The values are written out in a public memo and there’s an internal version with plenty of extra context, and the yearly 360 cycle plus management training emphasize them constantly so there’s no way to be ignorant of them. This team member was given a 3 strike policy by the manager to improve and he clearly kept failing (I personally witnessed 1 of these strikes happen in a small meeting) so he was exited. Managers are trained to be very clear about expectations and you are given a chance to improve if you don’t meet them. And it’s supposed to be a regular conversation, not just a quarterly or annual thing.Honestly the sanest and most transparent and fairest process I’ve experienced in my 16 yoe. But as always things are team/manager dependent.As for workload, depends on team but my personal experience has been 80% 20-30 hours per week, 15% 30-40 hours, 5% 40+. This completely depends on the team/project, it's changed for me as projects have changed.",

Some people love it and others, not so much. Like everywhere else, it depends on your team and your manager as well. I know people who have been there for over 10 years and don't plan on leaving.I often call Netflix \"the highlight of my career... so far\". I got to do awesome work, build something used internally that is so cool that it could literally be a separate business, and I had fun. Plus, for a movie fan like me, some of the \"perks\" were heaven. It was \"Hollywood meets Silicon Valley\". 10 year old me would not have believed what was in store for him.If you have an offer from them, take it. If it doesn't work out, it's not that big a deal.

I started a new workspace, pasted the prompt to AI agent mode, and let it code away.What it created was not code I'd ever allow to pass code review.Did it work? Probably - I didn't try it. But my god it was awful. Abstraction that made zero sense. Repetition to tedium. Same function sometimes written 3 different ways. 10 files to do what should have arguably been done in 3. I binned it and I was thankful that at least my own work was better than that, even if not superb.

I have seen huge boosts for some things like getting to write boiler plate and also one-shotting medium-complicated stuff that could have taken a long time to get right. Especially big speedup if you are not an expert at the language.BUT, I have also seen the opposite that it goes well in the beginning and then the LLM introduced bugs it cant find (even latest models and different models). You are then left with a huge body of unknown code you need to understand and find the bug in. Sometimes the bug can be complicated both to find and solve because the whole thing may not have been structured as you would have done it. Even if you are a senior developer you can become dragged into the mess, essentially becoming a 100 percent vibe coder. You get locked into the solutio space the LLM made, and it becomes harder to imagine how you might have done it. There's a temptation to go along and have the LLM fix its own mess rather than taking the plunge into it, creating an even bigger mess. That can waste a lot of time and leave a bad result. Just to be sure, I think LLM-generated code is not usually bad. Often it is very good about naming, error handling, best practices, reuse... Things many humans suck at. But when it gets stuck with something it can't solve it seems to mess the whole thing up again. So you really need to use it delicately. Have a feel for what it can do, when it is on the right track, when it is really understanding an issue and where it is merely guessing. Carefully review and roll back anything that doesnt work. Use dedicated sessions with minimal context for specific difficult problems, to help focus. But it is not easy - something the LLM might do well in one context, it can screw up in another (e.g. using wrong arguments etc. even though it clearly knows the right arguments in other contexts).When building larger systems of lasting value, build it all as you would yourself in smaller pieces one at a time and with unit testing... rather than hoping you can one-shot it all. Try to make good design decisions and it follow them, rather than the opposite. Review what it is doing. All this will eat into the benefit of course, but I still think there IS a net benefit, unlike examples of overuse which can be net negative.",

You can grind LC and get a job but tbh, in my experience jobs dont want to see if you can solve it quickly, they want to see that your critical thinking is up to par. That's why they say think out loud. I used this guide on DSA: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)It links videos by cracking the coding interview author who explains all DSAs.

But short of any good metrics to gauge for, a lot of companies use this as a method to basically test what a lot of people consider the 'fundamentals of engineering'. While you may not use a B-Tree IRL, understanding Big(O) and fundamentals of how algorithms work, and how you approach breaking down problems is something that's good to understand.Problem is that then interviewees started memorizing the problems and optimal solutions, and it kinda became an arms race between interviewers and interviewees. There's an entire industry around helping people prepare for interviews with the FAANG companies, and so much resources out there on YouTube and so forth that teach you exactly how to do all of these things, so the standards got pushed up so high that if you \\*can't\\* do leetcode questions, you just look bad compared to someone who can.

The fact that it constantly has to make these \"AI doesn't do anything useful\" type of posts/comments betrays a real discomfort at the way software development is changing. It's essentially an attempt to convince itself that it won't change (e.g. copium).But technology is always changing. Even programming itself has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Computer programming literally used to be done on [punched cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). And then programming languages came along, and over decades, it became more like English and abstracted away to the point where we now have Python.I think we are seeing something similar with AI in software development. It will become literal natural language being fed into a processor (LLM) to write a program. From punch cards to pseudo-language to natural language sounds like a reasonable evolution of creating computer programs.My advice is to ignore both the AI hype and the AI naysayers who call it a \"grift\". There is a real utility for AI models. It won't be a perfect solution but it doesn't have to be perfect to make an impact. It just has to do enough.If you are worried about your job being taken over by AI, you can avoid that by learning how to use AI tools effectively. So maybe try Cursor or Claude Code. Or Windsurf. Whatever tool you like. Be a productive developer who can use AI effectively rather than disavowing AI and calling it a grift. You will be the one that companies will want to hire.",

It sure does help a lot and saves my time. I would probably need hours of Google search and multiple blogs to understand what ChatGPT teaches me in 30 mins.Just because AI cannot solve every programming problem, doesn't mean we need to completely dismiss its abilities.

Each program increment, we have a long ceremony where everyone participates to come up with a plan for the next increment—the next six sprints. It’s structured, and imperfect as far as Agile is concerned, but it does a decent job at helping us set expectations with our stakeholders and between teams.In this sense, our sprints are a means to track the work that needs to get done. And since there’s always more work, there’s always more sprints. If we ever don’t have more work and more sprints, we don’t have jobs anymore.In any sort of a scrum methodology, you want your sprints to be a specific length, as this will help you find metrics by which you can track the performance of your devs. Granted this *also* isn’t strictly Agile, because according to Agile, the main metric of worker productivity is working software. But managers will be managers and suits will want numbers, and when scrum is done right, it makes the job of delivering software under a manager’s scope less bad.I’ve never heard of “unlimited short sprints” before, and I have many questions and concerns.",

Any minor blip in metrics or anytime someone gets concerned you get paged and have a million people asking for status updates every minute.I left my first team because we were a core team and eventually all I did was fight fires and support other teams that were creating new features. Plus I had to deal with the annoying \"?\" emails from Jeff too often.I left my second team because the PM kept changing requirements right up until releases, some of which just completely changed the entire project, but we still had to make the deadline. My day was basically fully booked with meetings, and when I told my manager we were at risk of missing the deadline because we don't have enough time to work with all the meetings, their solution was to schedule a weekly meeting to discuss that. My final team swapped managers right after I joined. I was tasked at developing a major feature by a prime day, we were a month out and they didn't even have the basic feature requirements ready. I didn't want to deal with that and left. I've dealt with some similar issues at other jobs including my current one, it's not nearly as bad though. Amazon has a ton of bureaucracy. And you have to navigate that while designing and building software quickly. Corners are often cut to meet deadlines, and then you have to deal with all the tech debt on top of that. You can find great teams, but you can also land on a bad one and have a terrible time.",

I quickly hopped jobs and if I went back knowing what I know now - it'd be an absolute gold mine. I'd be confident in my abilities to actually start something, and I'd know that I have the confidence and skills to learn anything I don't know.I think you're in that latter group since you already held a position as SDET 1. Sure the office isn't hot, but agency wise this place can be a dream, and you can get some serious generalist experience here. Don't checkout and shoot yourself in the foot.

As everything started hitting the fan after COVID and companies started looking to save money they couldn't actually figure out who or what department was at fault or to blame for whatever. That's why we first saw the engineers get cut. The dev owners and leaders get more face time and essentially blamed the engineers. Then after that didn't fix anything the started cutting middle management who told them it was the engineers fault. Now they don't know why to do so they're bringing in consulting forms and offshoring work to fill in the gaps. From what I can tell these consulting firms as really leaning on the specialized/clear cut responsibilities by telling the businesses it's impossible to higher one expert who can respond to a wide variety of issues and software in today's specialized tool environment in a timely manner. The way to fix that is using consulting firms to bring in say an architect for a month, then bring in a cloud designer for a few months, once the architecture is setup bring in the engineers. Meanwhile now you're no longer paying an architect salary after the main chunk of work is done. I actually tend to agree with it but it's going to suck for us all around people",

As a junior , your salary comes out of team budget so you're doing real work that matters to the team (and company), but it's a very small part and someone has made most of the design decisions for you. As you progress, you take on increasingly larger parts, make more design decisions and even start deciding what other people should work on. But you write the bulk of your code as a mid level or senior engineer and then the code you write starts to taper off dramatically after every level.My direct impact is really hard to measure in $$$/user terms.

A lot of people let it boil over and ditch the entire industry because of itFor future reference, there's a middle-ground between sacrificing your mental health and burning out, and quitting cold turkey: Establishing very clear professional boundaries, and sticking to them no matter what.I value my WLB very much, it's literally the most important thing to me about the team I'm working on. If I somehow ended up on a team that had a bad WLB, I'd start looking for another job. I know I won't change that teams culture, it is what it is.Instead of quitting though, I'd make my boundaries very, very, very crystal clear, and I would stick to them. I'm available 9-5. Hard stop. That's not negotiable. If I'm asked to do something at 5:30, I just won't respond. Or if things aren't terrible and I still have a decent relationship with that person, at most I'll give them a courtesy: \"OK, I'll take a look first thing tomorrow morning\". I don't care if deadlines get missed, not my problem, that's a planning problem. I don't care what insane committments my boss made. I work 9-5.Boundaries are what let you escape work mode. I don't work after 5pm, and I've taught my brain that same boundary, so it doesn't think about working after 5pm. If you lack that boundary, you can't escape \"work mode\" *because you're always working*. Your brain knows you're always working. You taught it that, why would it let you turn that mode off?In the same vein, sounds like your boss was an ass, but I also don't let feedback get to me. I do my best, 8 hours a day. If my best isn't good enough, not my problem. They hired me, that was their mistake, not mine. If my boss hates my guts, thinks I'm underperforming, or using AI? Tough. I'm not thinking about that after 5pm, and I'll just smile and nod during my 9-5, without changing a thing.The reason boundaries like this are so important, and so powerful is it lets you keep your mental sanity, even when you're at an aggresive, fast paced, toxic company.If these boundaries aren't acceptable for your employer, guess what happens? They fire you, and you're *exactly* where you just put yourself voluntarily anyways. But the hidden truth people aren't talking about is it can takes months, sometimes *years* before a company decides to pull the trigger on firing you over this kind of stuff. So you just bought yourself a whole lot of time to search for another job on the side, all while staying sane.Keep these things in mind for your net gig. Props to standing up for yourself, but at the same time remember there's usually a happy middle-ground hiding between the 2 extreme options of quitting vs burning out.",

We are so much more than a paycheck. And wayyyy more than just our jobs. Someone below mentioned establishing boundaries, and I do agree with that. In this case, you were working under an aggressive (and frankly unrealistic) timeline:\\- Boundary 1 is not putting all the blame on you. Super-tight timelines? Hmm...maybe you could do something more, or maybe your boss overpromised to his customer, or maybe you're incredibly understaffed and asking to do work that one person alone shouldn't be responsible handling. \\- Boundary 2 is knowing when to switch off work when you log off your computer. It shouldn't keep you up at night. We are not surgeons, where one wrong mistake means that someone dies. We write code to make products. Like...the world will be ok. And so will you.Last thing is that people don't quit jobs; they quit managers. Your boss lacks the emotional intelligence that I would expect from someone managing people.

Any time I did anything that wasn’t different from how he would do it he would DM me and lecture me and we would get into an argument. When I left I found out he was actually really sad about it and actually really liked working with me. I had no idea - he certainly never showed it.",

So depending on the work and scope, this may not be a bad thing. A question to ask the smaller company would be the extent to your role. Will you have the ability to design systems then implement? if so, that can provide a ton of great experience. Typically at smaller companies and if you have a good manager, you will have more opportunities to lead initiatives even if your title or experience doesn’t match that.",

Hiring someone off the street is risky, because a lot of people are really, really, really good at hiding their red flags during interviews. Then 6-12 months after they get hired, those red flags start surfacing. Not a lack of technical ability, but rather just being a *bad employee*.The value of referrals for a company is it's no longer a rando they're interviewing. It's someone that another employee, one they already like and trust, is saying is a good employee. It's not instantly getting you past the technical part of the interview or anything, that's why they still give leetcode interviews to referrals. It's just vouching for your character.All employees are able to refer people to SWE roles. John Doe in sales can refer a SWE. Betty Jane in marketing can refer a SWE.Don't hyper-focus on meeting people from tech. Focus on meeting *people*. Period.With that in mind, any hobby that involves more than 1 person. Join a social sports league, become a regular at your local dive bar, join a meetup group that tries out new restaurants every week, do *anything*.If you make genuine friends, your network will grow.",

Most jobs don’t care about passion. Accounting? HR? Business? No one gives a shit about your passion.However don’t go through school half assing things. I did that the first time with a degree in accounting back in 09. Graduated and couldn’t find a job. Ended up working at a front desk for 10 bucks an hour. Took me 3 years to get into management and even then I was making 35->50k. So 7 years to go from like 15-50k in my 20s. It sucked.My advice no matter what you do it’ll suck. A lot of posts here complain about work and corporate culture and most of the time people are just not used to working 40 hours a week. You just need to find the least amount of suck. Tech is good because at least you get paid well (but only if you can land a job…)Most other business degrees get paid much less and suck even more. Don’t look for passion. Look for something you can put up with.",

        "body": "I love programming, but I find that getting quick feedback really helps me stay focused even on long term projects. I mostly do C++ and usually work pretty close to the iron. Each class I'm working on right now, I know approximately what it needs to do in my grand scheme of things, and usually write unit tests as I go. Usually at any point in my project I can either build my code and run the tests to verify that everything I've built so far builds and works as expected or I'm within an hour or two of being able to do so. There is no \"I'm going to work 3 months on this before I know anything about whether or not it works.\"The projects you see in CS are not really the projects you'll see out in the industry. They've probably already told you that most software projects are maintenance. You'll very rarely ever see new design, just because on average most projects' lifecycle is 80-90% maintenance. The skill of reading someone else's code and understanding what they're trying to accomplish is not really something I picked up in CS. I had to learn that as I go. I'm not saying wait and see what industry jobs are like if you don't like CS, I'm just saying don't expect anything you do to look very much like anything you've been doing.They may also have told you that programming languages are as much for communicating with engineers as it is with computers. They didn't go into a great deal of detail about that when I was in school, but a decade after I got out of school a computer program was like a book for me. I can read it and I can tell you things about what the guy who wrote it was thinking. Probably things not even he was really aware of. Comes in handy, and it kind of feels like a superpower when you get good at it. Not saying you should do anything in particular except keep that in mind if you make a career out of this.If you enjoy doing this for a living, there is never an end state. It's impossible to know everything that there is to know about computers at the moment, and has been since the '80's. There's a lot of arrogance in the field because a lot of people seem to think that they do know everything there is to know, but it's far more important to have a pretty solid idea about what you don't know. At least as it pertains to what you're doing right now. The landscape is pretty much infinite here, and far more similar to the math landscape than I realized up until surprisingly recently. You probably can find something to explore there that's interesting to you. How easy that is or whether you even want to try is of course entirely up to you.Whatever you decide to do, *you* ultimately set the direction in your career. This is as true now in your academic career as it is in your professional one. You can decide to stay in academia somewhere and explore the frontiers or old problems there. You can go off to the industry and solve math problems for stabilizing fusion reactors or something. You can go grind out enterprise communication code at some company and probably make a lot of money. Long's as you have the rent by Friday it doesn't really matter all that much. But you decide what you're going to do with your life, or you can try to float through it without much of a plan at all. I think a lot of people try to do that. From what I've seen, that path leads to regret sooner or later. Maybe all paths do, but if I end up regretting anything at least I was the one who decided to go that way.Hope you find a direction you like. Good luck!",

I've heard we might be moving to a software on demand model, where people just describe what they need and the AI will just generate the software for the user as needed.

If you've been practicing software engineering, these kind of tests will be strangely difficult at the start, and it's going to feel SUPER weird.

It doesn't mean you're bad at engineering, it just means you're a little rusty on the syntax for that specific test, and you got unlucky. You absolutely should not treat that as a problem with yourself: it literally happens all the time. Especially people who are more senior, has taken on more management roles, a lot of them will absolutely fail coding tests because the problems they've been dealing with a lot harder and a lot more important than FizzBuzz.

CloudSec, DevOps/DevSecOps and AppSec would be the most natural jumps, security automation engineers could also be a good fit.

I'd contacted my recruiter with maybe a week's notice and let them know that I wasn't feeling well and they were cool with letting me reschedule for a month later. The recruiters tend to be fairly forgiving with moving it 1-2 months out at the very least, although I'm not entirely certain about whether that looks the same for 3-6 months.As a side - If you want to run mocks, I'm happy to do so! Feel free to send me a dm, I'd been notified that I'd passed the loop - definitely down to try and help others with the same.",

All you really gain from trying to avoid the cooldown like this is the opportunity to APPLY to Meta positions again during the in-between period after you’ve finished your prep but before the cooldown would have ended if you were to continue with the interview and get rejected. That period is max 6 months, based on the numbers you’ve listed.Some people on this sub would give their first-born child for the opportunity to do a full interview loop with Meta or any other FAANG.That being said, only you can really discern where your mental state fits into all of this, and you should always prioritize yourself and your safety first. Failing an interview loop after spending significant time cramming for it can be mentally devastating.For me, the regret I would feel from not taking the interview loop when I inevitably have a several-weeks/months long period with zero interviews would eat me alive.",

The fact that you're questioning whether you'd even be happy there makes it an easier decision imo.That said, you mention system design feels solid and behavioral is manageable with prep - those are two major components. The coding rounds are definitely the wildcard here. If you do decide to withdraw, be upfront with your recruiter about needing more time to prepare rather than making excuses. Most recruiters appreciate honesty and might be more flexible about future timing. You could also try reaching out to coaches on platforms like prepfully who've been through Meta interviews recently to get a realistic assessment of your readiness in a mock setting.Either way, don't beat yourself up about it - better to interview when you're genuinely ready than to rush it and potentially hurt your chances for months.",

Even if you're not fully prepared, you have some solid foundations - your system design knowledge is valuable, and behavioral questions are definitely manageable with focused prep over the weekend. The coding rounds are the wild card, but you already passed their initial screen, which means you're not starting from zero.The reality is that most people don't feel 100% ready for these big tech interviews, and there's something to be said for getting the experience even if you don't nail it. You might surprise yourself with what you can pull off under pressure, and worst case scenario, you get valuable interview experience and feedback that will help you crush it next time. Plus, if you're already questioning whether you'd be happy at Meta, going through the process might give you clarity on that front too.

If you just say \"hey, im a developer and would like to volunteer with you\" your going to get blank stares because people either won't care or they don't know what they could use you for.Also, don't just limit yourself to non-profits. Look around in your area, maybe you've got a mom and pop trash guy in the area who runs a trash route with little to no tech usage, see if you can build him a notification service so he can let out schedule changes to his customer base.Maybe you've got a neighbor who runs an etsy shop but has no way of managing their inventory.Point is, get creative, think about whats around you and see if you can fill any gaps, don't just offer your services...offer a solution.This is the route i did back in the day and I was always asked why I didn't just get \"a job\" or was told to \"just go get a job\" either related or unrelated and my view was at the time, i could either get experience or i could get money but at that point in time with how the market was i couldn't get both and only experience was what would lead to a career.Been at it 14 years now. If this career is something you want to do, just stick with it, stay hungry, find ways to provide value to people...don't just offer \"software development services\"....figure out a way in your area to offer solutions.",

Even when content is fully AI generated, it’s not always slop - in some fields there are very strict standards around quality control and ensuring accuracy, like with some kinds of AI reporting and AI translation, and for companies there are generally very specific rules around disclosure of what content is generated using AI.

If you're having trouble even reaching that, doing some over time ont he days when you can is a great strategy, both of my last jobs (both remote) had unwritten rules that if you needed some time off during work, no worries, just make it up when you can. You can definitely do it, and with remote work being more common in our industry than most it's probably even more possible than in other industries, just make sure you take care of yourself first, and most importantly, find a good company that isn't run by sociopathic assholes.

If any colleagues mentioned the possibility of switching to different projects or if there are upcoming ones that seem more hands-on, it’s reasonable to ask. Just frame it as an interest in growing your skills and contributing more technically, not as dissatisfaction. You could also ask around to get a sense of what other teams are working on. That can help you make a more informed request.",

My advice is to try to get involved in any aspect of the project other than the GUI stuff. You say there's no SDLC but there must be a deployment process, testing, etc. you can get involved in these and may be able to write tools that integrate with the GUI instead of just clicking buttons. Maybe the GUI generates bad code sometimes and you have to tweak it or learn how it works under the hood. I don't believe what it generates is unreadable, you just don't know how to parse it.For interviews, minimize your experience with the GUI and talk up any actual coding you did.",

This call took place on July 2nd, I was ghosted. I used the same thing with another interview that had the same results.So then I tried that I was looking for a role that better aligned with my career aspirations in terms of fulfillment and a more modern tech-stack, but I also haven't moved from that phone call.In my mind, these two reasonings have faults, what if the family issue re-occurs? Or, why did the applicant leave their current role while searching for jobs?I have thought about just putting presently working, but I don't want to entertain going down the route of lying. I know corps aren't honest themselves, but Idk, just because someone else is doing something bad, doesn't mean I should i guess.And to address your latter part, I completely agree, I have been in the slumps, but lately, I really feel that I have processed most of what happened and been more proactive about picking up new tools/ frameworks.",

There's two competing views of automation: the first, is that it causes layoffs and lower employment, which is the luddite view. The second, is that innovation from simpler tasks frees us to do the more complicated tasks. 1000 years ago 95% of us were farmers: iron, then steel, and coal freed us from a life on the farm and let us build cities. Change is never comfortable, but historically it's been an economic good.> With software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ?No one really knows, but we haven't hit the ceiling yet. The CS field is boom or bust, but there are still market dynamics. Eventually, the surplus of trained and experienced devs will leave the market through attrition or promotion, and it will be much healthier for grads.

There are physical limitations to how much food any one person needs, so it's easy to see how we don't need too many farmers. You can make the same case about doctors or lawyers or accountants or architects. Their demand scales with the number of people on the planet: Demand ~ PopulationHowever, software is fundamentally different. There's always a new idea around the corner, some service that could be digitized, some new feature to be added, some code to be optimized. The amount of software scales both with the number of people *and* the amount of digital services each person is willing to adopt: Demand ~ Population x Digitalization.Furthermore, there's an idea that digitalization actually enables such a boost in efficiency that it's still a beneficial allocation of resources. For example, suppose you're playing Economy Manager 2025 and you have to decide what to do with 10 college grads with the goal of completing auditing companies. One way is to train all 10 to be accountants. However, if you were to train 1 software engineer, that one SWE could develop tooling to boost efficiency so that even if you have 1 fewer accountant, the remaining 9 accountants could double their speed.This is why many people view the demand side of software to be much more flexible than traditional occupations like medicine or law. However, even if the demand for software is more flexible, there is indeed a limit. Software doesn't defy the laws of supply and demand, and yes, more supply is inevitable going to cause salaries to drop and hiring to slow.",

But the “next big thing” has traditionally come out of down markets. Also, there is something to be said about communication and culture fit. It’s generally easier to work with someone face-to-face who speaks the same language as you and is from a similar culture. Yes, there are exceptions to this, and sometimes people decide saving money on compensation is worth any difficulty in communication. There are a lot of subjective factors at play. We’re at a period of time where there is more demand than supply. It will likely shift at some point, but there are no guarantees. For some companies in the west, they can leverage cheaper labor from other countries.

Focus your cramming session on the major changes since Angular 2-4 era - things like standalone components, signals, the new control flow syntax, and how dependency injection has evolved. Don't try to memorize everything; instead, understand the core concepts and be ready to draw parallels to React when you get stuck.Your best strategy tomorrow is radical transparency combined with demonstrating your learning ability. When you hit a question you can't answer perfectly, explain how you'd approach it in React and ask about the Angular equivalent - this shows problem-solving skills and genuine curiosity. Emphasize that you've successfully made framework transitions before and that your recent React experience has kept you sharp on modern frontend practices.

So getting a BA will not bar you from working as a SWE. However, why do you want to make the switch? I didn't study CS -- my degree was in Math -- but iirc, the BA option for math had less Math course requirements than the BS option. I think it may have had less physics requirements as well? I graduated a long time ago, so I am not completely sure. I assume a BA for CS probably has less CS requirements. Are you wanting to take less of these courses because you are trying to double major in something else that the BA will give you space for / possibly overlap on requirements? Getting a college degree takes a lot of time and money -- my personal opinion is that since you are spending all of the time and money, you may as well get the option that looks better on paper (which is probably the BS) unless you have a good reason not to. Having the BA won't stop you from having a career, and it may have no impact at all on your career, but since you are studying anyway, you may as well pick the option most likely to give you an edge. If you are just getting the 1 degree-- I would get the BS. If you are trying to double major to be a more rounded human and / or give you skills for alternative careers and getting a BA makes that possible - get the BA.",

Companies hiring senior engineers want someone who can think through complex problems, mentor junior developers, and deliver quality software - skills you've been developing this whole time.That said, the market reality is that many job postings do mention cloud and AI, so having some basic familiarity won't hurt. You don't need expensive certifications or months of study though. Spend a weekend playing with AWS free tier, build a simple project, and you can honestly say you have hands-on experience. Same with AI tools - use GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT for a few coding tasks and you're ahead of many candidates.

If you only worked with Java before you might not get hired for a C++ role for example.I think your best bet is to have multiple sets of resumes where all your projects align with the specific role you are targeting. So if you’re doing web roles, have a bunch of web projects listed, etc.You should list your startup experience as real experience, but maybe just put Software Developer. Lead developer with no experience is a red flagIf I were you I’d be spam applying to both internships and full time. Some companies will hire interns for a year after grad",

Yeah, sometimes contractors get stuck with maintenance and tech debt cleanup. But I've seen plenty of contract roles at Metana grads end up in where they're building core features and making real impact. It really depends on the company and how they structure their teams.The downsides are obvious, no benefits, less job security, and you're usually first to go if budget gets tight. But if your current company is forcing 5 days RTO and the pay sucks, might be worth exploring.I'd say go for it if the day rate is significantly higher than your current salary (like 20-30% bump minimum to offset the benefit loss). Just make sure you save extra for taxes and health insurance.The boring work thing isn't always true btw, some of the most interesting projects I've seen people work on were actually contract gigs where companies needed specialized skills fast.",

It's not going to make me money.I found what I did was look for things at work that were awful. Certain services or processes that sucked. I made it a goal to make those better and leveraged it for promotions.Over time I met my financial goals. Afterwords chasing money felt a little empty. Because I spent time at work I had little social life outside of work. I'm slowly trying to get to know people and I attend therapy to talk about barriers holding me back. I think if I could do it over, I would tell myself there's no rush. Sets goals and try to meet those over time vs stressing out in the moment about how I compared to other graduates. It would have likely lead to me making more friends and having free time to possibly learn the new skills I found interesting. Most important, do not neglect your health for your work. See the dentist and get a yearly checkup. Use your insurance. Set goals to get those done. Make yourself accountable.",

You'll only really need a fairly basic, 2-weeks worth of learning, to make what most 2.7GPA CS grads can do right now.But CS will become much more specialized requirements (like a real engineer). Roles that are for software engineers will be heavily leveraging the education you got in school, rather than just during the technical interview and then you never think about data structures and algorithms until the next interview.Operating systems, at-metal, embedded systems, extreme performance and reliability. These are the things you'll be making, rather than \"plz change button color to #FAAB1F\".Architects will drop off the face of the Earth, because EVERYONE in CS will need to be aware of and thinking about architecture from day 1. This will only be a dedicated role in the most extreme companies.It all ultimately depends on what the business majors decide though. If they decide that they have no reason to keep you around because LLMs are \"good enough for government work!\" then you won't have a job, even if the manager at the organization is being a complete dunce for thinking AI can do everything when it can't. Because often times, customers don't care if the software works ALL the time.

So my advice is to learn to make full stack apps, but your mileage will vary. Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and a database, then, do your best to make a CRUD full stack app. Use a framework like Angular for front end and Spring boot for the backend. You can use something like MySql for the database.",

Rewriting your CV to be more filter-friendly is probably an easier place to start, though.At the end of the day, if you get a certification, that _still_ doesn't mean you have any professional experience in that language.What you need to be able to do is to back up the assertions you make on your CV. If you are confident you can (honestly) convince an interviewer that you will contribute at a specific level to their JavaScript project, then nothing stops you from asserting that on your CV without a certificate.A course might help you do that, or self-study, or a side project. But the people who are \"beating\" you for these roles are mostly not going to be referencing lots of certificates. They may be making some strong – even boastful – claims about their skills; that's what CVs are sort of for. You get through the initial filter based on what you claim is true, and you actually get hired based on whether you can back up those claims.
