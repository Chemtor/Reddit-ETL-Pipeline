It seemed that I was just being thrown the scraps, and to them, I was.Then I got to do some CRUD app development that they were all doing - and I hated it. I much preferred all of the performance and scaling considerations I had to keep in mind when doing the data-related development. General business app development was extremely boring to me by comparison.Spent the past 20 years doing data engineering/data integration work - and while I’m sure the app development space has changed - I can’t see myself ever moving away from data - the problems still interest me to this day.",

Yet, none of them really solve the core data issues like nulls, duplicates, redundancy and many more. The simple and old school style of sql, bash scripts and crontab jobs can do much more than fancy tools. It makes feel like we all should go back to roots using pure sql for most part for pipelines processing and maybe little bit of Python here and there. I hate how much noise Databricks makes using the term, \"medallion architecture\", which already been in practice for more than 3 decades even in traditional warehouse environments. They just used fancy marketing tactics to sell their product.",

The position is unlikely to go to anyone who is external. Direct competitor has a chance if they are beyond stellar. You are competing with applicants who have connections plus are experienced plus have direct knowledge of the domain.Another company I know put up a fake job posting for DE (the position was already hired, but needed to repost due to a migration to a new hiring systems). They purposely only posted the position on their public website and did not post on any job boards. Received 300 applicants in less than 1 day.Sad thing was, their automated rejection email says: “we have reviewed your background and qualifications and determined that we do not have a position for you” pretty fucked up considering that not a single applicant was reviewed since it was a fake posting.This position did go to someone who needs training though, that person had alot of experience in DA, but none in DE, and since high DA salaries are in-line with entry level DE, they know the applicant is capable and will stay. The company received many stellar applicants, but didn’t have the budget to pay for their asking salaries. Also, they wouldn’t lowball someone experienced since that person will quit the second the market improves.",

Nobody would hire me. The company that finally did hire me were one of very few willing to take someone on with little hands-on experience, but a capable brain and decent skills in Python and SQL. I thought I kind of fumbled the interviews, but they offered me the job and told me they liked how I approached solving problems.",

I think a data engineer is already a kind of specialist backend engineer who can get good positions because they are not easy to recruit, at least in my experience. Some DEs are also good at devops and web development, which opens them more opportunities.Another point is that I feel that those titles are overlapping and that a well-rounded DE can apply to multiple of those. I do understand it is impossible to find perfectly independent categories for this kind of studies. Namely, in the same order as the diagram: - big data specialist- DWH specialist- data analyst- data engineer- database professional- BI analystThe fact that big data specialist comes before DE, although a DE is in general considered a big data specialist, may just show how the DE title still lacks recognition. At the opposite, surprisingly DA and DS are put together whereas there could be a giant gap of skills between an SQL DA and a DS expert in ML. Overall, I feel this study or this result is too unclear to draw much conclusion.",

However, it’s also able to “connect” to other sources besides its own duckdb stored data file. For example it  can access and query parquet and csvs as if they were tables. Even more interestingly since it’s “in process” it has full access to the memory space of the process. What that means is that it can actually connect to a in memory pandas or polars dataframe and run queries on it as if the df was a table and it can write the results back to pandas df.

DuckDB being a column based storage database. Build an on-prem VM or cloud VM, for a Snowflake-like DB with it, for 0$ monthly usage fees. Speed will be whatever power that VM has for I/O and CPUs.

My manager then was a profoundly inept MBA who got pawned off on the burgeoning data team after one too many fuckups on the finance team, so he was a big sucker for the jargon that MBAs like.One thing that I missed at the time, and only realized years later, was that they never even showed us images of the interface.

Having that cash cushion is sooooo important. All this to say, my backup plan has been to stash cash during the fat times, and use up as little as possible during the lean times.

I had to involve our CISO to make an org-wide push for switching over to SSO and even then the pushback, especially from engineering, teams was hard! I would have expected engineers to be fully onboard considering how strictly they followed the security and access best practices for their own software development, but they expected more “lenient” and leaky standards when it came to data access.

In my job because of the misuse we have forbidden creating infrastructure if there is no architecture approval and the creation is not done by the cloud engineering team.

If he still gives you the feedback that you need to ask for help less, don't ask for his help at all for a few weeks to months.

It should, should, execute in the time, a full table scan completes, so on 500mm rows, maybe 5-10minutes, dont know the hardware setup.Reasoning behind that statement : Variable length string, that is just in the table meta data. Actual data is written to data pages. So EXPANING the length, should not cause a full page rewrite of a given page, since nothing needs to get rewritten. Already existing page splits, are not effected either, its already a pointer to another page.So, it should be rather harmless, to change the variable length, as long as it gets increased. Decreasing the length, I'd be a bit more careful, but should functionally behave the same. Not having a clustered index... it should not affect that change, since if I know how mssql works internally, it will check every row, if it complies with \"new column meta data\", so a full read trough of the entire table. It doesn't matter in reality, if that table is a heap or a clustered index for a full scan.I'd say, plan for a couple of minutes of outage, and go for it. Take a full backup to a testing stage, run the change, to get a good idea of how long you got an outage. You will have a short outage, since you will have a full table lock, and any application trying to write to the table, will wait for that lock to be released. Depending on the isolation levels, you will have read queries do the same.TLDR:Shouldn't be a big issue, should be 5-10 minutes of downtime./edit: Its gonna be a schema lock, so whatever isolation level, read queries will be blocked as well.",

That way, your pipeline knows to wait X minutes before finalizing a window. Spark Structured Streaming supports this but tuning gets tricky. Flink or Kafka Streams handle it better. Confluent Cloud and Integrate offer simplified options if you are okay with microbatch intervals and less real time granularity.For schema drift, landing raw JSON or AVRO into a semistructured column (like VARIANT in Snowflake) can help. Then handle transformations in a way that tolerates missing or new fields. Don’t let one new sensor field break the whole job.MERGE issues in Snowflake would mean too many small writes or unoptimized clustering. Try splitting late events and ontime events and processing them seperately. I think you are almost there.",

Certainly there are better and worse choices to make but trying to squeeze the square peg into a round hole is gonna suck. Putting unstructured data into a structured database is going to be painful no matter which way you slice it.But the real game is winning the organizational battles required to begin actually addressing the root causes of the pain and bringing everything into a unified stack. Iot has changed, when it first started it simple scalar data like temperature and there was only a couple of things going on. These days there are much higher expectations on what the devices need to do. They expect always on at the edge monitoring of complex sensors and it takes a fundamental change in the org to get that done. You need your ml or data team to get in the drivers seat and make the pieces fit all the way from the firmware up to the customer UI’s and tying it all together. Wanting it to be simple of easy won’t help. Look at the most painful problems you have, and start identifying what the true technical root cause is and then begin working to make it better. If you don’t have a person or people with this sort of cross stack powers to actually drive the platform as a whole towards success it’s just going to always be an underpowered brittle mess.That’s my 2c anyway. But concretely it’s important to figure out what needs streaming to meet sla’s vs what should be done batch wise for streaming. Companies tend to commit hard to one approach or the other and then struggle to make everything fit that paradigm. You will need both and you need to comfortable with that. Same with structured vs unstructured. Some of your data just isn’t structured today.",

We used a parsing library to extract those source tables from sql code of the queries (super nice and we got it working FAST. I really thought it would be very difficult). We even got manager-employee hierarchy into the mart, so we can use BI tools now to show things like \"which tables are queried most often by people under director X?\" or \"what is the total attributed cost of running those queries?\"\"... for direct subordinates of X?\", \"... for all subordinates of X?\", \"... for all subordinates of X, who are not managers?\"And since we did good modelling in the data mart, PowerBI, does not need any extensions, or fancy DAX to answer such questions.",

Then made a vector equivalent value of the theme and the chunks,applied a roll-over technique aswell to merge adjacent chunks which cosine similarity beats a tested threshold. Then persisted this data to my database, with every single chunk having its appropriate time-window, from where it was cut off from in the YouTube video.I then created an interface with streamlit where I could see the data-breakdown, their theme, the video thumbnail and the time the video was cut off from, (so this also works as an automatically created YouTube chapters as opposed watching the video and titling sections by hand)I also created an input field where questions relating to any part in any of the videos are asked and the top 5 chunks which are most relevant to the question are retrieved and displayed on the UI.The videos fed into the pipeline could be a playlist or multiple channels with batch extractions.I personally use this now to get to the most relevant part of an information I'm trying to reach out to in the news. Or help properly index tutorial playlists to find the most relevant piece to my problems.Built this with kestra, postgres, open-ai,flask and docker",

Use widgets and `dbutils.widgets.get()`. • **CI/CD**: Databricks CLI or REST API + GitHub Actions (or Azure DevOps) work well. Keep tests fast—mock Spark contexts where needed. • **Data**: Stick to Delta + Unity Catalog for governance/versioning.

        "body": "I think either could be good for you. Normally internships are structured these days with some kind of project to work on and at least some guidance. I agree with the comments about consulting mostly, but I doubt they would put you on client work or at least throw you to the wolves like they would with an employee. Having worked both for telcos and consulting, I will give you some thoughts:Consulting: you will probably work on one or a few projects. They are looking for prospects to hire when you graduate so it's like an extended evaluation. Consulting is good because you get exposure to different industries and projects, so you learn skills and approaches you might not pick up working elsewhere. One other thing that's maybe overlooked is that you learn how to sell and explain your work, which is valuable in companies later when you need to justify a project or hype it up beyond just explaining the technical side. Working there as an employee though can be grueling not just because of the hours, but because you need to build your career often with little help. They assign you to some client and expect you to pick up the skills you need. They usually do give you some support with a mentor role, but they might be good or just suck since they are assigned. So it can be a stressful experience depending on your personality and resiliency.Telcos: this is a good option because you will get exposure to a lot of processes with a lot of data flowing. It's mostly structured though, but really teaches you how to deal with high volumes. If we are talking a bigger telco like AT&T or whatever then they tend to have all the tools and applications so you aren't looking at a kludged together mess like in some other companies. There is data stored around all the different processes that go on in a telco, so while the product isn't the data platform, it's probably as close as you are going to get. There is usually some pretty high-level analytics work going on as well around customer retention and upsell.",

Dagster does the orchestration for me, as implied, then dbt does transformations after data has landed in Timescale, also orchestrated by Dagster.I can't really speak to how the performance would be with loading data into Snowflake via Sling, but it backfilled about 300GB of data on the initial run in under 6 hours and every 4 hour incremental loads take around 20 minutes (though this could probably be optimized much further). All hosted on ECS Fargate containers.If we had no budget constraints, I'd probably look at a SaaS offering to do the extract and load for me, like Fivetran or equivalent.",

Might need to work for a smaller team in that case, though. The best would be a liaison role between IT and the business, but usually that's a people manager. Just show interest in the business and push to learn more. If your boss isn't gatekeeping you, you may be able to get on some calls with the business.",

You’re not chasing prestige—you’re chasing consistency. Platforms like DataCamp have career tracks that walk you through Python, Airflow, Spark, dbt, cloud, and testing *with* hands-on projects baked in. That kind of setup might be just what you need.# What to focus on next:Sounds like you’re solid on Python, Airflow basics, and batch stuff. If you want to move from “I adapt what’s already built” to “I build and improve,” aim for:* **Advanced Airflow** (custom operators, sensors, etc.)* **dbt** (great for modeling, testing, and habits that scale)* **CI/CD** (even lightweight GitHub Actions can go a long way)* **Cloud skills** (pick one—AWS, GCP, whatever your team might grow into)* **Streaming with Kafka** (even small local projects help)# Make it stick:If you tend to fall off self-paced stuff (totally fair), give yourself some structure without burning out:* Pick one portfolio project and let that guide your learning.* Show up at the same time every day—even 30 mins counts.* Use tools that track streaks (DataCamp, GitHub commits).* Find a learning buddy or join a Discord to stay accountable.# Are certs worth it?Only if they *help you finish*. If a nanodegree or structured program keeps you going, it’s 100% worth it. Just avoid collecting shiny badges without building anything. One finished track with a solid portfolio project beats 10 abandoned ones.",

A transaction is intended to be a single large block of rows. To wit contention is intended to be low.Taken together, that you think iceberg is a transactional database is your main problem. The design desire of iceberg is to be able to have atomic writes to disk from ephemeral stateless writers for the purpose of retaining and accessing large amounts of data for long periods of time. Any alternative not involving optimistic concurrency necessarily involves a single stateful system that needs to be on for as long as the data needs to be accessible which is absurdly dumb and massively expensive. The only reason databases and database servers exist is to literally provide a lock. To the degree you can avoid locks you can cut massive cost by making the computer independent of the retention process. Don’t get me wrong iceberg is very rough around the edges and leaves a lot to be desired but that you neither understand why it exists or what it’s good for wouldn’t be something I’d publish this widely on the internet.",

The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.I'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.---> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).Iceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.> Putting the burden on the clientThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealingThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.Iceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?This section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.In fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work! ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict A section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.First of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.And yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.> \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\".Complete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?Absolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.What you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a databaseThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?This is ridiculous. I'm out, and I'm barely half way through the article.",

You might find yourself seeing a pattern of what sector is hiring.>Are AWS certs (like CCP or DE Specialty) worth it?Only the free ones for me as it showed some sort of proactivity which one out of about 7 interviewers have commented on.>What helped you the most in getting your first DE job?Having an interesting story followed by interesting projects. I lost my job during the pando, taught myself and have only ever wanted to DE seriously.>What would you *not* waste time on if you were starting today?This pops up a lot and I honestly hate this question. The idea of \"never wasting any time\" is akin to not enjoying anything. Before you know it, you end up becoming a leetcode robot. And, by the way, this is the perspective of somebody who was literally jobless and paying all living expenses for two people through rapidly dwindling savings so stakes were extremely high in my case.To answer your question, if you want to not waste time, then learn concepts and only concepts. Skip putting a lot of time into specific tools. If you want to \"learn Airflow\", you're much better off understanding orchestration and building something with some kind of orchestration in it. This is the equivalent of building a table instead of learning how to use a hammer. If you can understand common problems and patterns with orchestration, all orchestrators have tons of overlap. On the flip side, Airflow will have features not in ADF which may, or may not have features listed in \\[insert name of wanky orchestrator here\\].Build projects and ignore everybody who says they don't matter because projects are a lot more about getting you in the right mindset and having something to talk about during the interview.Get off the internet and write code. Do not follow influencers. Do not track the state of the job market. Do not give yourself space to fall into a negative mindset. Code, learn, apply for jobs, have a break, repeat.At the end of the day, there are a lot of DE jobs out there and even more people who just whine about the job market being hard. If those people took the time they spent complaining and doomscrolling and applied it to learning, they might actually be on par with the people who just cracked on in the meanwhile.",

You are doing a Masters in CS - honestly you can pick up a lot of good skills towards DE by working first as a software engineer and working around data systems. People tend to get into DE either down a software engineering route and specialising in software or as a data analyst/scientist transitioning into more pipeline and modelling work.The main obstacle I see to a new entrant into DE is just the breadth of technologies and tools out there, for mid level roles we can find candidates who have worked on our tech stack and junior jobs are incredibly competitive as its a hot job title right now. We are in the middle of hiring a DE and we had over 250 applications for one open position. I've been doing DE for just over 3 years, after 5 years as a software eng after doing a PhD in Engineering. To answer your questions:How early to start applying? If you are doing something super data based then maybe a year or two after starting your first position. This would allow you to get in and really get to know a specific database and understand how to operate in a development environment. If you're also doing personal development and learning on what you're interested in then it could work.Are certs worth it? I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.What helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.What would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation. There are technologies and prototypes which were a waste of time but there isn't really anything I would regret.I appreciate this might not be the sort of feedback you were wanting to get, I am only one person and there are different thoughts around how easy it is to break into DE. Good luck!",

They typically have large data sets you can download and then can work on your scripts to get that data loaded into your database of choice.As others mentioned, ELT is more popular than ETL these days. That just means with ELT get the data loaded into the database before transforming it. Vs the somewhat older method of manipulating (transforming ) the data before loading it.The advantage of ELT is you can quickly compare data between the source and your table (row counts, data types, etc) and not have to figure out if you transformed it wrong before loading it.Once loaded, you typically only need SQL but could also use Python to read the data from your “raw” tables and write it back to an “intermediate” or “analytics” table.

        "body": "ETL vs ELT is a form of shorthand.Rather than neatly dividing data processing into two types; it encourages you to think about the steps.Extraction, is typically \"given\". You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.Loading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.Transformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.Moving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...T1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in \"raw form\". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.T2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.T3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.None of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in \"big data\". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments. That's where you'll see the real implementations and it's never as clean as ETL vs ELT.",

Like if your SCD type II dimensions were blown away, how would you recreate them from scratch? For instance, I add a new column and want to backdate the values to what they were when the data came in, so ideally want to blow away the type II table and rebuild with all the history. You can't easily do that unless you use snapshots on source data, which is what we ended up doing. Most dbt literature of actual snapshot implementation in real life situations basically said use snapshots as sources to read from. Once we did that and handled type II SCD's ourselves by interpreting the dbt snapshots, our problems went away.",

If there’s a way to add an automated check on traffic levels prior to pulling the data that’s probably the best solution imo.Job logic:1: Check traffic to see if API is available2: If not, wait 5 minutes and return to step 13: Else pull the data.If the data doesn’t pull in time for some sort of downstream dependency that’s another issue.Each job should have some sort of check that its upstream data is up-to-date.

I have seen few customers who built their own custom system similar to this but it usually involves a custom middle layer managed externally where the queries are triggered from. Like a python code that fires up series of Data Enginnering jobs in a round robin style on to different warehouses. Havent seen anything that receives a query from an external tool, interject then routes it to different warehouses. It would have to also route the resultsets back to the client so not sure how that will work.Part of the Snowflakes major appeal is the security and scalibility so unless the solution runs fully within Snowflake, the security may be an issue for some as well support if things stop working.I guess hard to say w/o knowing how it is architected.",

I'd steer anyone away from the academy for sure.A trap laid in the agreement to join the academy is talk of a refund but only if you did every bit of course work on the timeline they set up. So if you're stuck like OP you might miss deadlines, meaning they can deny your exit request. The agreement also states all issues are to be handled via arbitration.

So if there is push for ASAP delivery and some of that needs to be sacrificed, we will not put the production tag in it, it might be out in an experimental way, and this helps us with our process while still providing value at a timely manner, while still being \"agile\", but it's very hard to not allow experimental to be treated just like production and tech debt to pile up as everyone needs everything ASAP.Edit: About the process, the process is there to help you, not for you to follow it, so if something feels off, encourage changes and iterations on it.",

It's an unfortunate side-effect of changing jobs every year or so to keep my salary competitive.**2. How do you gather and translate business requirements in your teams?**Varies a lot. Either meet with a department head or manager who wants something done, or meet with an individual who's been asking for something to be fixed for months. I prefer working with individuals, they typically use the data daily and know exactly what they need. Managers tend to have lots of lofty ideas and designs that end up translating poorly into implementation details. **3.

You have some DAG running hourly and some running daily. Do you rerefresh the client id DAG on each run ?

The pro subscription is a fixed cost per month (quite low), so if you have numerous job runs per month, it approaches 0 cents per run.* There are no details on the configuration / connectors being used for loading the TPCH dataset. CPU usage can vary quite a bit depending on the connector, and underlying driver. Furthermore, it could be mis-configured or not using the most optimal setup. Overall, users are quite happy with the performance.* Many useful features are omitted, such as [VSCode extension](https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/vscode), [transforms](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/transforms), [runtime variables](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/runtime-variables), replication tagging, [python wrapper lib](https://docs.slingdata.io/examples/sling-python) (which is quite easy to use compared to dlt), [global connection system + dbt conns support](https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/environment), [column casing/typing](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/columns#column-casing), etc.* Sling reading APIs will come out soon, currently in private beta.What has become clear, at the end of the day, it is a matter of taste. Users prefer sling over dlt (or vice-versa) due to the type of overall UX and flexibility they each respectively provide.",

We also do engine agnostic transforms, runtimes, code generation, workspaces, runtime variables, dbt runners and generators, support for other orchestrators, pii lineage, etc and more, we're a company with big goals, wouldn't be a fair comparison. Just trying to make interesting discourse, there will always be something to nitpick. If you want to submit a specific correction i'll take it. I'll ask our writer to add connector detailsregarding UX, it could be, but from my research, users talked about distribution (dagster) as being the main reasons they like sling, some mentioned speed compared to airbyte (which was weirdly slow in people's descriptions) and nobody mentioned interface (but yk how people justify after choosing so who knows). IMO for people's choice it's probably the short path to trying that matters, which is distribution and interface. I haven't heard sling mentioned outside of dagster context but you probably know more about that than me.",

You all may not like it but he is your boss and unless he's willing to see the light, it's not a democracy so you have to use the tool provided.Trying to go behind his/her back and work around it will only come back to bite you at some point.Best of luck",

One thing that helped us a lot was their fallback cursor option - basically, if your primary cursor (updated_at) is null, it can fall back to another column like created_at without missing rows.They added this feature recently in response to this exact scenario: PR #403 (https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/403)We’ve been syncing to S3 buckets using it, and it’s been stable so far even on large tables. You don’t need CDC or any schema changes on the source DB, which was a big win for us.Might be worth checking out if you're still exploring options.",

        "body": "I’m admittedly more familiar with batch-based processing as that’s how my shop rolls, but I think the use of Pulsar indicates an event-based architecture for a services/integration layer. If that’s the case, there’s something missing between the REST API and Pulsar to periodically poll the API and produce topics for Pulsar to ingest (that may be in the microservices). However, from both a compliance and support perspective, it’s good practice to retain a “raw” copy of the data on ingestion so you have a recovery/fallback point that can also be used for audit and lineage purposes, especially if your source doesn’t retain data itself. I’m a bit unclear on how your PM role fits in the mix and where your engineers are, but speaking as someone who has platform strategy responsibilities, I would recommend focusing on confirming the required/desired business and tech capabilities, then working with your engineering leads to determine the right tooling to fit and the appropriate design. Good luck!",

        "body": "A REST API is a pull-based request/response interface (kinda like using HTTP to query a database). My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. Unless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow. I’ve not heard of Aerospike before but a quick skim doesn’t look like it’s for this requirement. I asked about the role as it sounded like you were scoped to design the solution, which engineers tend to get a bit twitchy about PMs/POs doing :grinning_face_with_sweat:. But understanding how it works so you can help steer/prioritise is a whole ‘nother thing of course. SInterestingly though, my place has this type of architecture managed by an “integration services” dept and my data engineering crew are downstream from that… unsure if that’s common across companies.",

If you're very strong in all aspects of SQL (Joins, CTE's, order of execution, etc), then you're solid for a DE role. Now focus on data modeling which is very hard skill to get good at even after years of experience and many fail interviews even at senior levels, it's unfortunate truth but it is what it is. Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. Since you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. Learn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. Pickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across. Google cloud isn't very popular compare to the other two. You can also pickup cloud related skills on the job, doesn't have a steep learning curve. If you're aiming for FAANG, then you'll need to learn DSA (Python works). I hate this part cuz even though much of what is asked in interviews is not used in the job, it's still required to learn coz big companies use this technique to eliminate bad or not so good candidates. DE sometimes feels like a multi-skill role, but even today, lot of heavy lifting is done using SQL. Ignore all the loud noise about AI. It's good to have it but won't replace DE role anytime soon. Our team DE's are using the paid version of copilot for GitHub, VSS code stuff to make their life easy, faster, detect issues early enough.",

Is it a boring stack? Yes, absolutely. Every job will feel the same as you're likely going to be propping up a load of packages somebody else built. That being said, you can get paid a lot.Alternatively, working with newer, more modern tools is really exciting. You get to feel part of the news sometimes, although it's a very competitive space and takes a lot of energy.So, my advice is really set out what you personally mean by career growth and also what your goals are.

Or can you alter the prompt to generate those columns (and then monitor for malformed JSON where the prompt forgets)? If so, maybe your postgres table could have those core columns, then you have an \"additional data\" json field that holds the rest of the response. You then create a view / table that extracts the additional metadata into its own table with a common key. That solves the ETL side, IDK about meta base but hopefully it could lazy load some of the data from the view?",

        "body": "A \"data perspective\" btw - another guy wrote about the messaging part, also valid.SCD is slowly changing dimension, and there are type 1, 2 & 3 - then hybrid variations depending on how old the design was.In modern times, we simply use SCD2 or SCD Type 2, which is row-based tracking of the business key - what makes a row unique and never changes, and tracking changes to the data portion, what does change over time.A good example is a credit score, ship to address, customer address.Some ERP systems have SCD2 tables labeled as \\_HIST or \\_History, but for DW purposes, we break down information from top-down, then bottom-up, then build what is missing in the middle as layers of transformations.So if you tie sales to geography and your customers are the general public, they move a lot, so you need to track at-that-point-in-time where they lived. A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.So the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.So... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.This is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.If you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.So you'd have a DIM\\_PRODUCT\\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.You have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",

        "body": "Agreed. The actual terms come from distributed messaging systems and are “at least once delivery”, “at most once delivery” and “exactly once delivery”. The emphasis is on the “delivery”. Given that messaging systems are designed to send messages between two different systems, this puts the onus on all of the receiving systems to do some sort of dedup on their own side. But it is impossible for the messaging system itself to do that on their behalf. The fact that you can deduplicate in the receiving end doesn’t change the fact that it was delivered twice. Hence “exactly once DELIVERY” is considered to be impossible.",

In truth, I haven't tried out the Free Edition so I couldn't vouch for it but in terms of Scala and Spark as others have pointed out it's not getting as much attention as Python.By far the focus is on PySpark and SparkSQL and perhaps some R. It seems like they're moving away from Scala. I mean it's still Scala 2 not even Scala 3 so one can only wonder...The Databricks Academy doesn't even offer any trainings on Scala Spark from what I can see. You're best bet is to look for some course or book on O'Reilly (I've done the same) or online free materials.",

You’ll face a hard problem and learn more and more about it. All the nuances, edge cases, similarities to other known problems, etc. Eventually, new problems have similarities to problems you’ve solved before. Practicing and being obsessive about learning is the superpower for getting good at building software. Thankfully, the majority of documentation is free, and learning resources exist for the curious, even if it costs $40 a month. What an investment. A few hundred bucks in a year to learn from industry experts?! So much better ROI than college.",

Apart from the underlying programming concepts, there is not that much to learn. Most langauges (inside of the same family) behave more or less the same, and even when switchting between web frameworks for example, there are just so many different ways they can work, while still doing the same. I am also not shy about using documentation all the time, I even make a poiint of downloading all relevant documentation to my laptop so I can work offline, while still looking stuff up. There really is no need to \"keep up\" with new languages, frameworks, patterns etc. They might technically have an advantage to the way I am used to doing things, but I am productive now. If I keep chasing the newest trends, I will spend a few months to years learning the new way of doing things, while not really being as productive as I could be. And when I'm done, there will be a new thing and I might as well start over. The only time I will learn something new is when my current tools have an obvious weakness in dealing with my current problems, or I need to coordinate with a team that is using a specific thing.

I don't know what's your skill level but I recommend making a coding portfolio first, then adding projects to it.4.

Take a carpenter for example, he has a set of tools that may include a hammer, saw, chisel, etc. He isn’t excited about those tools, he’s excited about the product he’s making, whether that’s a chair, door, etc.Same thing code for programming, the language you pick is a tool I.e. python, JavaScript, C++, etc. Each has their advantages and disadvantages.You want to build something that you love and enjoy, then use programming to build that. You probably have no interest in how dating websites work etc. That is the likely reason you are not excited about it.Pick a subject you enjoy in real life, like Football, cooking, rugby, gaming, etc. Then think of a little idea. Take football for example, you could build a simple hard coded Stadium displayer. Which shows you the top 10 largest stadiums in the world. It can then display facts about each stadium. Keep it real simple, nothing fancy. Make sure you write the project idea down too and break it up into small objectives.For example:* Create array of hard coded data* Create stadium card to display name, image, stats like capacity, facts like famous matches played thereThen once you have a basic version, have a look at it and see what to improve. Things like add a database, authentication, better styles, etc.If you don’t relate programming to what you are actually passionate about and enjoy then you’ll probably just eventually drop it.The people you see that are passionate about programming and love it are actually passionate about the area they’re building in rather than the idea of programming itself.",

Maybe that means spending time mastering DSA using Leetcode, or building a bunch of small projects with different architectures (helpful for systems design), or just focusing on acing your classes.How much time you put into your studies and projects is going to be the biggest factor her under your control. Chasing money is a bit of trap, and don't worry if learning X will help you get into FAANG or not, but worry that learning X will give you the skills to be excellent and building software.Making it in this field is a lot more than getting hired at a specific company or two, and requires continual learning and growth for your entire time in industry. The skills you need to do well as a junior, are only part of the skills you need as a senior, and on top of that it's extremely common to switch tech stacks or even sub-fields (like infra to backend, or product eng.) Be more ambitious, and find a goal that you can both work towards today, but one you won't achieve even after 20 years.It's not a game of inches, but one of miles, and you'll be playing longer than you can see into the future.",

Be on top of all your assignments and when you have nothing that needs to be done just code shit up or get ahead of the readings. Don't leave before 5, the more you code the easier it is. You can do leet code, making your own app, it doesn't really matter, what matters is you are staring at code so your brain gets better at it.If you do this you will have a bunch of free time and be ahead of everyone. If you don't do this you will be in a rush all the time and that SUCKS. Luckily I got this advice early so I only did like 1 or 2 all nighters in my entire degree.Also make friends with your tutors and ask questions, it might take a few months but figure out who the smartest people in the year are and try and get into their study groups.Also exercise. You will probably be able to take advantage of free classes at the gym and it does wonders for your mental health. To clarify join the classes as they will teach you how to exercise correctly, don't try and figure it out on your own.If you want to get a partner / find a fun social group join the evening student dance classes. There's usually like salsa or something. If you have some social anxiety this will help MASSIVELY!If you want to code in the evenings too see if there's some kind of competitive programming stuff like capture the flag teams. You get to travel on them and it's a pretty wild experience. You will also become friends with more experienced programmers who can give you great advice.Just to highlight again, 9 to 5 every week day you are studying.Good luck and have fun!",

That’s where I started years ago. They have 2 tracks, Ruby and JS.

This website doesn't deal with finding a job, but is great for knowing \\_what\\_ to learn in many technologies and career paths: [https://roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python) . If you don't have direction, that gives you it. Also join smaller online communities where daily discussions happen, so you can see not only what's in the tutorials and curated content, but how things work day-to-day.Skill itself is not enough to find a job. Yes, the market is much tougher than it was 5 years ago, but programming is still the right choice if you have the brains for it. It's going to take hard work to get a job, but the value/effort ratio is much higher than that for other jobs. The best case scenario is to know someone that can introduce you to the right company: trust and a feeling of community are valuable to companies that know what's good for them. So see if you, your family, or your friends know someone like that. Even if they don't have an opening, they may introduce you to further connections of theirs. Listen to their advice and don't take anything for granted.If you can't find that person, it's time to polish your CV and hit the job boards. If you're not at all comfortable with your skill level, aim for \\*\\*PAID\\*\\* internships. You might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. It's going to feel like a slog, but it's worth it. Be respectful, definitely don't let AI write your application or emails, the lack of effort is noticed. Many companies won't notice a presence of effort either, but you're better off without them. When you see a company you really like, try to prototype an open source project in the same domain as their product, and put it in the application. Best case scenario they see the effort and dedication, and they'll know you can be valuable to them, worst case scenario you have one more small project in your portfolio for the next company you apply to. There was a period where being disruptive and extra casual gave you a leg up, we're no longer in that period: be respectful (don't confuse this with submissive) and professional. Remember the people on the other side are people too, and if you can make their life easier by being honest and not making the interview/email tough for them, they're more likely to want you as a team mate.Best of luck, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",

If you don't know anything, even the best tool in the toolbox is useless. While learning, stay clear of AI for anything other than giving you deeper explanations on things you don't understand, but always double check the explanations of the AI with *proper* sources, e.g. with blogs, with the documentation. AI is known to lie.The technical barriers are not lowering. That's a huge misconception. If anything the barriers for getting a job will rise, not fall. AI has potential to take over large parts of the entry, low skill job market, so the barrier is not going down.As for languages and technologies in demand: only the local job advertisements in your area, preferably from larger, established companies, not from startups, are the only thing that can tell what is in demand.Yet, the traditional languages, like Java, C++, C# will always be in demand and are quite safe bets. Python is on the rise. JavaScript is also heavily in demand.",

If you don't have strong fundamentals, you won't understand why something doesn't work and you won't be able to vibe code out of the hole you just dug. Speaking for experience, almost every fundamental thing I had to learn on my own paid massive dividends for spotting shotty code, mistakes, bloat etc. 2) C, Python, Javascript are not going away. Hoping to skirt by with one language or framework is pretty naive IMO in 2025. You're constantly juggling these things for the best outcome in my experience. Like, a project might use python libraries with C under the hood, that gets served to users via javascript frontend. 3) Technical barriers are not lowering, they're rising if anything. Anyway, typical things that help are a positive attitude, being honest about mistakes/not getting something, jokes and being useful, not a burden.4) There are many good cases - you can understand something deeper, ask it to build some exercises for you to deepen understanding etc. The thing to keep in mind - if tomorrow AI disappeared, could you still perform?",

        "body": "Fundamentals for DSA and languages are important probably moreso than ever.For example, if you prompt copilot in javascript with something like `function quicksort(nums) {` it will almost always output the wrong answer. It looks like quicksort but its a very inefficient implementation of it. Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not \"quick\" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.That said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples. A prompt like 'I want to study binary search as if I'm reading a textbook, from first principles and with theory, without many real code samples, in order to learn it through and through. Be as verbose and long form as possible' . The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.A soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better. It should be difficult and hurt your brain when you're learning and growing. You don't build muscle without pushing the limits of your body, and its the same with your brain. You grow when things aren't easy or simple or mindless.",

What is before the code, what is leading to the code, the thought process, the design decisions, the compromises are what really counts.Do not just focus on the code. Focus on having a problem, analyzing the problem, breaking it down into smaller and smaller parts, then solve each of the parts individually and finally implement the solutions in code.I totally side with people saying that building stuff is the key as that is how entire generations of programmers learnt to program, even before the internet with its countless tutorials existed. Yet, only trying to implement already existing solutions is not the best way to get there.My recommendation would be that if you see an interesting project somewhere try to replicate it *without* looking at the code first. This is the real way to learn. Figure out how things work. Try things. Experiment. Fail. Fix. Succeed.Do not be afraid of failure. Every failure is teaching you something. It is gained experience. You know now how not to do something, which is equally important to knowing how to do something. Failure and struggling are absolutely integral and vital parts of learning.

No one here can tell you if your approach is good FOR YOU.In principle, your approach seems not bad. You should keep in mind as you go through these exercises that no matter how many repositories you comb through, you will only ever be touching the tip of the iceberg. The world of software development has more ways of doing absolutely everything than you can shake your fist at, and you will never become an expert by just looking at other people's work.I suggest as you go through these exercises, instead of trying to rebuild the same thing you just observed from scratch, establish a cadence of identifying problems that can be solved or improvements that can be made with code. While reviewing repositories, take notes. Then, when using the concepts you discovered in these repositories in your own solutions, do not allow yourself to look at the repositories at all. Instead, look at your notes.And remember as you go through this that it is not recreating other people's solutions that makes a great developer. I understand you're just trying to get started, and that's fine. But be aware that at some point you will want to detach completely from the example repositories and make an effort to implement a novel idea without any example to guide you. Programmer talent really shines when you find a gap and fix it. And the best developers are the ones who can think outside the box and identify solutions where one is not readily available. So make it your goal to get to a point where you're comfortable trying to do something that's entirely yours.",

How to code comes out of having a need that prevents you from attaining or achieving something that you want. Figure out the why, and the how will come with experience. With your approach, you don't know why code is written in a certain way, or why code is written at all in a project to some extent. It's a lot easier to learn when you know what the end objective is, and what success looks like. It's a measurable, achievable milestone, rather than aiming at some amorphous end point that isn't anchored to the amount of experience and know-how you have.An analogy; if you play chess for the first time, you may think that a good approach to play is to just capture as many pieces as possible. Unfortunately, chess isn't so simple. An 1800 ELO player is going to make moves that a 400 ELO player simply cannot even begin to understand the justification for, even if they understand the how, which was simply to move a piece legally. So you might be able to go into a mature code base that people acknowledge as being well-written. But you have no idea why it was written in that way, the intentions, the problems faced, the historical context. And if you can't figure out the why, then I might as well hire an LLM over you, because they at least know the HOW even better than a human, even if they have no idea WHY they're writing code in a certain way for a certain purpose.",

By looking at someone else's solution you risk locking into what might very well not the best solution (or even a good one!).Remember: just because a program runs doesn't mean it's perfect. There could be all sorts of fuckery going on under the hood, things held together with spit and a prayer, and the next time the program gets updated, the author's best choice is to just start over from scratch - this happens a LOT in the real world.So unless you're at the level of being able to determine if their code is good or bad (in which case reading their code is probably going to be pointless), copy the program by using it, learning it, and then recreating it - but better, of course.

All I had was our legacy .Net desktop app codebases to work off of, and that's also the code I needed to work on. I learned really fast that way, too, and made a lot of improvements to the code. Building from scratch can be daunting, it's nice to see how others have done it. I would suggest just a minor modification to your plan:Between steps 3 and 4, modify the code. Break it. See what happens, and what you can make happen, and understand what things do not just through your research but intuitively. What does it actually look like to change this number? Does it do what i expect? Can I add a button, or reroute a button to go somewhere else or do something else entirely? I think that, getting into an existing codebase and wreaking absolute havoc with Google at your side and Git protecting you from self-destruction is a great way to learn, and then once youre comfortable, yes. Build. There's truly no substitute for building from scratch.",

        "body": "I actually think that this highlights a fundamental tension around Python that lots of people either don't recognize, or don't engage with.On the one hand: Python is a great language for teaching, for a couple of reasons. The whitespace handling enforces good practices, the simple syntax is really great, the robust libraries available make it easy to not-worry-about parts of the code that aren't the focus of the current lesson.On the other hand: Python is a great language for Getting Shit Done, because generally speaking people are in agreement about what's \"the Pythonic approach\" to a problem. Lots of libraries already exist, and also, most of them have easy-to-pick-up interfaces because they're generally developed \"Pythonically\".Now - when you're learning \"programming\", you're learning several things at once: the fundamentals of programming (data structures, algorithms, what a variable is), and also a specific programming language (do statements end in a semicolon? how do I import something from another file?), and also a particular development context (how should my project be structured? How do I invoke build tools?).**Python is very good at simplifying some of this**. The \"learning a specific programming language\" part of it is pretty simple, and the development context is easily simplifiable (it can get complicated in real-life deployment situations, needing to navigate pyenv etc - but that's not anything a beginner needs to worry about in order to get started).**The tension is this:** Because Python has an active community of senior developers, who have coalesced on specific ways of working (canonized and blessed particular by the BDFL), there are some corners of Python that don't feel right if you've been exposed to other kinds of programming - some of which might actually be \"harder\" than the level of abstraction that Python works at!For a long time, this manifested for me as: *every time I try to learn Python, I pick a simple project and implement it - but feel like I haven't gained any knowledge about the language*. It was like it was too easy - like there was so little friction that nothing stuck in my brain.What made it click for me was to fully synthesize the idea that \"programming Pythonically\" is a distinct skill, and that \"knowing how to program\" *in general* was helpful for it but by no means sufficient for it. Similar to learning piano after learning guitar - there are definitely some conceptual overlaps and transferable skills, but some things that \"should be\" easy are suddenly hard, and other things that \"should be\" hard feel weirdly easy.",

        "body": "So when you move from C-like languages to Python you have to avoid \"thinking in C.\" It is kinda hard to explain but every language has a \"mental model\" you have to adhere to. If you use a \"mental model\" that is incompatible with your current language, it creates a sort of mental fog and you will get stuck. I can tell you have a C model because you used words like \"iterate\" and \"insert.\" I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind. The mental model for C is \"memory\" like little pieces of boxes of data that you manipulate. This data has an address and a type. Variables in C are really pointers (of specific type) pointing at memory boxes. The mental model for Python is more complicated because it has multiple fundamental types. I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types. They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict. Note they are not interchangeable. When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with. This may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have. You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C. An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***This means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right). In object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert. Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself. In some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness. Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C. It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome. I do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic. It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much. On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it. If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard. You will just quit. So, congrats for learning a C based language first.e: a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types. You might be asking what other types could there be? A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",

I think youre confused because you have skipped some steps. games are very complex as softwares and building one with no concept of coding or system design would be very difficult.i think you should go learn coding first. know the more complex data types. know some algorithms so you can learn to think like a problem solver. the journey of learning is different for everyone. idk what would be best for you, but i can share how i started back in the day.so this is how i learned python: wanted to learn in a more practical way instead of just watching tutorials. went to https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard. picked python from their \"prepare by topic\" section and just started solving the problems one by one. you can see that it starts from very basic stuff like hello world, then arithmetic operators, if-else, loop... and eventually moves on to harder stuff. i googled when i got stuck. looked at solutions if i failed. even if i succeeded, i looked at solutions as it would always teach me different ways of doing things. i found the one-liners very interesting in particular. hackerrank gives you a goal, in the form of badges. i kept doing it till i had the max level badge. after that i moved on to codeforces to practice more problems. found this ladder [https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html](https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html) . some easy-ish problems that you should be breezing through.this entire thing should take you 1-2 months. you should be very comfortable with python at the end of this journey. switching to something like gdscript or c# shouldnt be a big issue. if your look closely, all languages are same with some small fancy syntax differences. if you find yourself losing interest halfway through, then you might not be as interested in coding as you thought.making a game would still be a challenge after this journey but you should find yourself in a far more comfortable position that now.",

        "body": "> I've tried multiple times but it never actually made any sense, what is a bool, what is a float, what is a class,These are all things that are explained, along with their use, in a proper *fundamentals* course.I'd say to get started doing a proper course, like the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki or the CS50 series from Harvard (not the videos, the real course on EdX, Coursera, etc.). This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).The fundamental data types are easily explained:+ *boolean* - a \"yes/no\", \"true/false\", \"on/off\" value+ *int* - a whole number+ *float* - a decimal number---*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*+ it has a *suit*+ it has a *rank*+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)+ it has a *face* (image)+ it has a *backside* (image)+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked) all the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple: + It can report its rank (provided that it is face up) + It can report its suit (provided that it is face up) + it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down) + it can *draw* itself Now, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.As such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the \"Queen of Hearts\", the \"Ace of Spades\", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.----When to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.Note that in my description I did not (apart from \"class\" and \"object\", \"boolean\", \"int\", \"float\") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.Exactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine. They explain everything from the ground up and give you ample practical exercises so that *you* have to do the work and understand the subjects.You will need to sit down and start from zero with a proper course. That's the way to go.Most of the tutorials around assume some pre-existing knowledge or fall short on explaining the fundamentals.",

Its the standard reply I've seen when people ask \"how do I learn\" and other people respond \"just learn by doing projects from documentation and tutorials and such\"Personally, I think that's incredibly stupid. It is migraine inducing cuz you're just flailing about randomly, and your foundations will be non-existent cuz your learning methodology involves \"monkey try thing, monkey see if thing work or not work, but either way monkey not know why thing work or not work\".Find a long detailed tutorial which suits your tastes that covers the fundamentals. The typical data-types (float vs double vs array vs list vs dict vs Godzilla's ballsack), the typical loops and the differences between them (while do vs do while, for vs while), indexing (most programming languages have 0 indexing), etc.It may not be as sexy, and where Joe schmoe has a fully fledged game you may only have theoretical knowledge, but the difference is when you design a game, you will actually know how & why it works and you'll be able to account for why you chose a double instead of an integer and why you needed to use X instead of Y.Personally I liked this tutorial [https://youtu.be/\\_uQrJ0TkZlc](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) when I was beginning, but feel free to find one which suits your tastes. But yeah - how do you learn programming. My opinion, same way you should learn anything else. Don't put the cart before the horse and just start wildly doing things. Learn the fundamentals - what elements are at play, how they can be used, how they can't be used, etc. ONCE you're solid on that (won't take too long, its simple stuff, a few weeks depending on if this is your main pursuit or your learning it as a side interest) then do projects and learn by documentation and such",

But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. The spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins. That's a reusable little skill on its own that can be used with loads of dishes, and at some point could be switched out for a version where you make the spaghetti from scratch, without affecting the other part of the recipe - the sauce.For the bolognaise itself , it's a bit more complicated - fry the onion, brown the meat, add the herbs and tomato sauce etc. Again, each of those steps can be broken down into smaller ones. E.g. the onion - how to dice it and how to correctly cook it is a stand alone set of skills that, like cooking pasta, will be something you'll do in loads of recipes.What's any of this got to do with coding, you may ask. Those smaller steps - cooking the pasta, slicing the onion etc - are small reusable (and potentially replaceable) steps that are the equivalent of how you'd break down your code into reusable functions, and they all roll up into that top level overall recipe/application.",

You can draw rectangles & circles simply as well. If you're coding in OOP you can even make those classes. Since there's movement, and things are updating, you'll likely need a core game loop - easy enough to track. We can then break things down further: To make collisions, you need to know when a ball collides with a paddle. To know that, you need to know1) The Ball's position 2) The Ball's direction (it shouldn't collide if it's not travelling toward the paddle)3) The Paddle's position (should be mostly static horizontally speaking)4) The Paddle's direction (either left or right)So when the ball's at a point where it could collide with a paddle, check if that paddle overlaps with the ball, and if the ball is travelling toward it. If so, calculate the reflection angle of the ball, apply that to the ball - maybe keep track of the paddle's travel speed and factor that in somehow. If the ball isn't colliding with anything, just let it travel on - adding the sine & cos of its direction to its position values (scaled by speed). Then we gotta add the player in. Let them control the left paddle with their W & S keys, or Up & Down, or their mouse, either way. If they move them (i.e. keep track of the last position of the mouse, and check whether it moves between updates), apply the movement to the paddle vertically (not horizontally) and scale that by how fast you want the paddle to move.For the computer, either create some decision tree (like, if the current ball direction would cause you to miss, move toward it. Else, move to centre?) up to you. Or just have it go up and down.",

Since you have some idea of how to do this, then do something much simpler than pong.There is always the challenge, when breaking down a problem, that you won't know how to do some step. For example, if you've never worked with interactive graphics, then you'll be stuck at that point, having to learn what to do.Another challenge is how pong deals with the angles that the \"ball\" bounces. Is this something realistic or is there some pseudo-physics going on? It does seem to roughly obey angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. In other words, figuring out the dynamic behavior is hard.I'd probably try something like Snake where you don't have to deal with those kinds of physics.I think, as people break some of these problems down, they still wouldn't be able to code it up. They would still need extensive Googling or asking an LLM to find out answers they need. I doubt some will figure out the math needed if they aren't that strong in math (and even if they are, but are out of practice).",

You still have the degree. it will help open doors and make an impact in your ability to land interviews & not get your resume instantly thrown out. if you had no relevant STEM degree, then that hole is significantly harder to climb out of.You're getting overwhelmed trying to figure out how to cram everything and somehow be job ready in 5 months. You need to set a more realistic achieveavle goal. 18-24 months and ~4 hrs per day is a very doable timeframe. Now how do you actually fill that time? whats the perfect roadmap filled with exactly what I need to learn to get the most lucrative and best job possible?I'm sorry to say but there is no secret get rich quick scheme. there is no set path. so wtf do you do?This is a decent usecase for an LLM. you can use Claude to build you an accelerated plan (2-3 weeks)to review core fundamentals & then you just gotta start making shit. Ask for a plan that can get your feet wet in multiple different domains and build mini projects. you should probably also prep for tech interviews.if ur sticking with 8 hrs probably (2 hrs building proj, 4 hrs googling shit to figure out how to build(do not use AI), 2 hrs tech interview prep). first couple weeks should just be reviewing basics(mit intro to python OCW, try doing the PSETs see how you feel if it's all too tough then just go through the course).Over time you'll find some things more interesting than others and you can adjust your plan with Claude to get you rolling.its hardest to start building that momentum but once you do it'll be more clear. wont be any less easy tho. good luck",

It would be checking for basic bad practices mostly. Conditionals that could be simplified but aren’t clear, bad naming, etc. More things you could expect to make the code confusing or difficult to add to in the future. Also of course you can check for basic business logic that it probably does what it should and whatever else you might happen to stumble upon. What is it like when you receive code reviews? I think you’re mixing code review expectations with general teamwork communication. I would think before you get to code review is typically when you make yourself available to answer questions and help younger devs out which it sounds like is your next wanted steps.",

For example, football, cooking, wrestling, gaming, etc. Take gaming for example, I’ve been playing runescape lately and enjoying that. I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.With any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items* Display the items that you can select * Display the upgrade route once items are selectedNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.You want to always start small, then incrementally add to it. By adding overtime, that’s when a project gets complex. Even with the complex projects you mentioned, if you break them down into parts they’re actually very simple.You have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, so I’d recommend you pick up a framework like React / Next.js, Angular or Vue. I’d recommend you try all three with a basic project then you’ll get a feel on which one you’d like to use long term.If you want some project ideas give a shout on what you enjoy and I can hit you back with some ideas. Try not to use AI during this period, use things like documentation, googling, books. Then once you’re comfortable you can use AI for research but don’t heavily rely on it for your code, you want to use it to help you grasp concepts. The key thing for you right now is to learn problem solving while you’re doing these projects.",

In the beginning you make mistakes, you are not sure when to shift, how much brake pressure to apply and so on.

Program something, try to make it work, fail, try again differently, until it works. And then repeat with the next program. You won't learn by watching tutorials or reading books, same as you would not learn how to play guitar by just watching others play.

But, give me 10 min to google all info, and I will do it, since I understand the concept, not implementation details. If you really want learn programming, start doing some pet projects.

If the new size is still smaller than what you originally asked for, it's possible that realloc() might not do anything.* The total amount of memory used will increase with n, but because it's freeing what it had before, at most \"n\" memory will ever be taken up.* You might think 1 + 2 + 3 +... + n is some sort of exponential sort of thing, but it's just n\\^2.

Since in the loop only one element is accessed it'll just be one page of RAM.I'm not a kernel developer and I'm sure I said something not quite right here but I think this is probably what he means",

Github is basically just a place where people can upload code to the internet, but taking advantage of git it allows members of a group to work on different parts of the same code in a structured way. The idea is this: you first set up a base project with a main \"branch\". Each user can then branch off of the main branch, essentially making a copy of the code in the main branch, that they can edit on their computer. When one person has made good progress on some feature or part of the code, they can then \"merge\" their code into the main branch. The other users can then \"pull\" that code while working on their branches to make sure everything works well together.This is a really high level description that misses some of the main features of git, but it's definitely the tool you want to be using for this sort of thing.As for designing a game, as with any moderately sized project, the MOST, and I mean MOST, important part is planning. Don't just have each person writing their own bit of code without knowing how the pieces will connect. Literally draw diagrams on paper detailing how different classes will interact, what functions each class will implement, etc. before diving into the code. You don't need to go all the way into the weeds with planning, but make sure you have a good idea of how all of the big pieces will connect before you start coding.",

The most popular free platform for git is by far Github. And then: Code Reviews!To Junior Devs, Code Reviews seem scary as hell. Having someone else judge what I have written - what if it is crap? Also the feel like they could never review someone else's code.All wrong. Everyone can review code. Especially one written by peers. Most of what I've learned ever was either a suggestion from someone reviewing my code or something I found while reviewing other people's code. Code Reviews are amazing!Making sure no feature makes it into production, before one other person, that hasn't worked on it, has approved of what you did, will automatically improve the quality a lot!",

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.For example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? You have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.So which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.You pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. Now you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. This is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; \"principles first approach\". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the \"base case\".For example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.Best of luck \\~",

Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.I worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.This is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).For PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.For example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.Often, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.Python has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.But, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely). Python was able to overcome its limitations and be used in more compute-intensive coding.",

A lot of why people use react is that basically everyone knows react. So much less training.",

There's always someone who knows about this new thing, so you have to learn it as well, because you don't want to fall behind.

Programming is the same, it's about solving problems. You see a problem and figure out the steps needed to solve it. And then you look up how exactly each step is done.Example: you need to find the seller with the best price for a product. You have a file containing the information (all sellers and the prices). The solution will always be something like \"Read the content of the file, iterate over the information and find the seller that has the lowest price\". How exactly you do that depends on the programming language. Once you have solved that, you can solve all similar tasks (find the seller with the worst price, sort the offers by price or seller name, take inputs from a database instead of a text file, ...). The core concept is still the same.Everybody looks up the details, that's what references are for. I have decades of experience and still look up the signatures of some standard functions on a weekly base.

You may have missed the opportunity to break into the field. The time of being able to finish bootcamps and getting a job is mostly over now. Companies are expecting a lot more experience now than before. The self learning path is still possible, but doing it while having a child and needing to work another job while learning? Sounds very tough, and the needed skill floor being higher now also means it will take much longer than before. Now, if you are really really interested in it and not just doing it for the money then I would still say without a doubt go for it. The reason why I think this is an important difference for self learners is because the people with actual interest are always going to dive deeper into things. They are going to spend that extra hour or 2 working more when others feel like they have done enough for the day. Although, who knows, maybe in the next years we are going to have yet another boom where there will be so much work that any fresh bootcamp graduate can quickly land a job. For now, understand that this is not how it currently is and it may or may not change for many years so be realistic with yourself. Software dev isn't easy, it was just easy to break into the field before due to the amount of work there was.",

There are entire classes of languages and approaches that do operate differently: imperative vs declarative, object vs. functional, which you will come across in time, but don't worry about that now.Look at a few syllabi from colleges for level 1 and level 2 CS classes, buy the books and work through - just a few. Or take actual classes. Data structures and algorithms, K&R - this will tell you if you have the patience and interest. Do not get lost in online tutorials, there are no shortcuts. Don't worry about learning the 'wrong' language, you just need one that works for assimilating the concepts.Find job postings relevant to you, see what they require, get familiar with those, and apply.

        "body": "I'll first start by honestly saying that I run a free coding bootcamp (for lack of a better quick description) and I recognize that bias.I do as a whole agree with your point here about only do it if you really enjoy it, because yes it will be a huge mountain to climb.But I have to disagree partially only for how I broke into software engineering as a \"self taught\" dev so to speak (business undergrad). I learned through codecademy for basics then in my sales role out of college I built a tool for myself to automate some of my role. That became surprisingly successful despite being simple as hell (literally my first project ever). It was just a webscraper with beautiful soup 4. My point is more so that the problem here is about hiring and understanding the market data. If you study it in depth (this is actually my educational background ie HR) yes there are less jobs and that has directly led to waaaaaaaay more applicants per posting which means a waaaaay smaller chance of your resume ever being seen by a human and its ultimately just making it clear how awful the entire hiring process always has been ... imo the worst process in the world by far and so companies are often relying on referrals from employees as they tend to work better given that the employees can typically be more trustworthy than a resume and team cohesion and ability to get along with the team is one of the most important things any typical hiring manager is gonna care about (not saying that this should be the case). So why i bring up my case is that getting a job is just sales and referrals are a great way to do sales. If they know you and like you they will hire you. Especially at places that aren't truly NASA or OpenAI or FAANG. I personally feel that most job advice in this subreddit feels like its skewed towards those companies because they did truly use to hire 1000s of juniors but there's still millions of 20-50 person companies in non tech intensive industries that cant tell good from bad skill level to begin with and are hiring.I'll also add that no one told me about the functional programming job route and how surprisingly little competition there is for some of these companies. While some typical job postings will have over 1000 applicants these functional jobs will have less than 50 and even then its not hard to beat out the other 50 Lastly the other nuance to share here is that alllll industries right now to the best of my knowledge are crap for hiring. I dont personally know if I can say that programming is worse for hiring than others? My fiancée for example works in the public sector and there's been 1000s of job cuts",

However I’ve worked in backend web dev the majority of my career and while it definitely pays very well it’s not very interesting or challenging to me anymore, 90% of work the past few years is just solving the same problems over and over with a new skin. If I had had the chance to go to school I probably would’ve leaned more towards computer vision, embedded, graphics/media or something else but being self taught I took the pragmatic approach to enter the web dev arena. So my advice would be to pick up whatever interests you most, because that’ll make you happiest in the long run. If you are enamored by the high salaries in big tech then stick to web dev or AI but plenty of places pay highly for specialized and niche knowledge.",

That CS stuff is great to know, but it's not focused around making useful programs to delight users, or at any rate make their lives easier. HTML is used to create web pages. CSS is used to make them look nice. There are some data structures there (headings, paragraphs, captions, images, all that), but it is a stretch to claim you can code up actual algorithms in HTML/CSS. There's a lot more to programming than those. Javascript, for just one example.What kind of programs would you like to make for your users? Web apps? Games? Mobile apps? Controllers for washing machines and microwave ovens? Medical devices? I am not sure how you would know the answer to these questions as a sophomore. Take some more classes. Look at Unity or Unreal Engine for games. Do the web app tutorials in Microsoft C# / Dotnet. As for debugging your life, my response is this: \"It is functioning as designed.\" Keep on learning.

You should think about studying those in the next few years (you can start now on easy level which is actually a bit hard) just for interview practice.If you really want to do computer vision, you may need to look at grad school, but that requires high grades (3.5 or above in the US) and preferably you've taken relevant courses, perhaps done a undergrad research project.",

Then you can focus on your application with a reasonable approximation of the API. You will be able to test and demo it without the real integration.Insulate your code further with a wrapper class that drives your code in response to user input. That way the API interface and potential changes are isolated to a small part of the code instead of being sprinkled everywhere.Good luck!",

Some companies will give you some algorithmic coding challenge and immediately reject you if you don't score high enough. Another company might care deeply about your portfolio...but care far less about what you make and more about the specific tech stack used.Really though, if you can make a huge project that's relevant to already successful businesses, you are kind of leap-frogging an entry level position by a mile. That's like start-up territory.I've done a lot of new hire interviews... And while ever company is free to do whatever they want, in the three companies I've hired for, they all viewed portfolios the same way. It's mostly just talking point to bring up during the interview. It's not a huge deal, in the general case.Lots of applicants will have the same degree and a good GPA but, amazingly, some really will be awful at actually producing code. In the old days, whiteboard/quiz type questions were how we tried to see if someone really could code, but then everyone just started studying specifically for the type of questions that would be asked. I'm really not going to spend more than five minutes looking at a git repo or even a live website or whatever because there are just too many applicants and plenty of applicants are just going to clone somebody else's open source project. It's just something I would ask you about in the interview. I would expect you to be mildly passionate about it, because it's your project, and I would expect you to be able to speak intelligently about how you built it, on a technical level. Counter-intuitively an amazing project can be a reason we don't hire you.If we hire you, we would ask you to sign a non-compete and claim ownership of everything you develop. These contracts weren't always enforceable, and it might be different in your location, but the company wants you to give up your project and work full time on whatever they care about. If your project is so good, so impressive, so huge, that we think in 6 or 12 months it might take off and you would quit to pursue it, you would be a high risk hire. We want the applicant who will stick around for a handful of years. Only twice have I witnessed this. The first was a guy who clearly wanted to develop games. He had an indie game he was in love with and basically admitted he just wanted to make games but had run out of money. The other guy quit his full time job to launch his own app, wrote the app, and didn't sell as many copies as he thought. He was looking for a job but he was clearly super passionate about his app and wanted to keep working and focusing on it. As a person, and a developer who has my own side projects, I get it. We just need some money to pay the bills...but as an employee tasked with hiring good candidates... Those people aren't likely to be the best options and selecting a bad hire reflects poorly on me.",

I mean c and then c++, c is nice for learning manual memory management and resource management in general, then when you get the gist go to c++ which at this point should be mostly syntax suger for what you did normally",

Unfortunately, no language is simple really. Python hides a lot of it's complexity, but that means doing complex tasks with it requires you to learn that stuff or suffer later. If you have no specific domain you're interested in, stick with python, learn more complex things with it, then come back to the question when you really want to try something and python isn't a good enough fit for it. Learning deep is always better for learning sake, than learning wide. Learning wide and not deep is the cause of tutorial hell. If you absolutely _must_ learn a new language and don't care what it is (as you seemingly don't), find a project first, and the language will follow.",

Besides opening up career options, it can be used for almost anything, from backend, IoT, science, even frontend.

I haven't learned C++ so I can't say much other than it being a more low level language while still being familiar in terms of syntax.

I like seeing Github URLs on applicant their CVs, but interviewers are likely not going to check out more than 1-3 projects. Pin or highlight the projects you are most proud of, provide them with good documentation, if possible with screenshots or in case of a web app: a demo website. Make it easy to run.

Your custom-domain and medstuff repo's not so much. - Try and make your projects non-trivial. I do not get excited by projects like calculator or to-do apps.

Certainly do get proficient with at least one front-end technology, or you will not stand out among junior developers that are skilled in multiple domains.Best of luck.",

A scapegoat tree is probably even easier.You say you've already implemented linked lists. Have you tried implementing skip lists yet? They're more like a tree in performance, but it's just a linked list with shortcuts. Have you tried implementing a binary search over a sorted array? This is kind of what a binary search tree is doing.Lisp has a built-in \"dotted\" notation for cons cells, so you can just write example trees out to test your lookups, for example. Maybe try implementing a scapegoat tree in Scheme before trying again in whatever language you're using. Scheme also kind of forces you to use recursion, which is what you need to process recursive data structures like trees.",

Once you’re solid with that, binary trees become easier: it’s just two references instead of one (left and right).Then, build a simple Node class for your tree. Keep it minimal: just value, left, and right.Now, draw a small tree on paper and simulate what’s supposed to happen step by step:How insertion flows,How recursion works (base case + call stack),How traversal happens (in-order, pre-order, post-order).Use a debugger or print() statements to watch the logic unfold live. That’s how you bridge the gap between understanding the concept and writing working code.Finally — don’t rush. Trees teach you recursion, memory structure, and flow control all at once. So if it’s hard, that just means you’re learning something real.You're closer than you think.---Let me know if you'd like a sample in Python or a visual breakdown. Happy to help",

Object Oriented 2d UI heaven! Still haven't seen anything come close to it for interactive 2d work.It wasn't the best way to make a living, but I worked my way up the ranks and bought a nice house. And still had plenty of free time for other projects.I do math with js and html 5 canvas now. Picked up backend/server in 2004. Running my own servers in 2013. Mail servers in 2023. Now C#.NET Core. Stored Procedures.Programming basics are fairly simple. It's not as easy as some say to pick up new languages. It's kinda like making pie crusts. I've been making 4 a year for the last 20 years. 80 crusts now. Just 4 ingredients. Same routine/recipe, but I get better every time. More perfectly round. Less dough ripping mistakes. Better astheyics. Flakier baked results. Smoother process. Less mess.Essentially caring each time. Keeping at it. Coding is like that. Don't get overly discouraged at a mistake. Don't go on autopilot. Love. Care. Time.People would tell me \"Flash sucks. It's a terrible language.\" Well, clearly they did not know what they were talking about. Yes, it could cause computers to use battery and get hot. That's cause it gave the programmer power to access those resources and do fancy stuff. Same with security. It could be abused. Make it more secure and you take power away from the software engineer. People can't abuse resources they don't have access to.Just like guns don't kill people, people with guns kill people. Just take away computers and that solves computer virus problems. Next problem.....AI Music.AI auto carriage control arm installation.Day 3 =^.^=Enjoy the journey..",

It is a difficult course and will take a huge amount of time to finish. Projects can be hard but are great picks and require you to know everything learned prior to the project. You start with a simple, HTML only recipe Website and finish with a Full Stack Social Network you have to develop yourself. Also no matter what resource you pick do yourself a favor and don't let AI solve problems for you. You might think you learned something but you actually didn't. You need to struggle to learn and things won't be easy but that's how learning happens. I had my biggest aha moments when my code didn't work and I went through my code line by line explaining myself what happens exactly at what point.

It's really easy to rush things now and make bad stylistic choices that aren't a problem now, but will be a problem later. There's also going to be a natural \"changeover time\" where you remember how things work between projects. It's unavoidable. My only suggestion there is to work in a way that maximises productive time and minimises changeover time. If you block out a week to work on a pet project you might struggle to remember for the first day, but are then productive for the rest of the week. That's better than changing every day and being constantly unproductive.",

Usually, it becomes easier to remember the big picture of each project, as you learn and use different design patterns (you don't need to reexamine every detail of the code; you may only need to take a quick glance). With time, as you do this repeatedly, more things tend to stick in memory.Personally, context switching is something I regularly talk with my manager about (I mostly prefer working with only one project at a time, but there are usually 2-3 projects active during a week; I try to focus the work on separate days). Getting questions about different projects also requires some context switching and disrupts the \"flow.\" I try to keep a \"developer diary\" about what I have been working on each day; it helps me to quickly remember what I was working on previously when I need to switch between projects (it's really helpful to read on Monday mornings and before going to different meetings).",

This is also good practice for writing code for others to read! As they will have even less knowledge of the project than you.Also, use clear separation of concerns, so you don't mix e.g. UI stuff and file-handling - don't stress yourself by having to re-read (re-learn or even remember) everything at the same time. You can often do this by having more modules / classes / packages for your code, so it is more like a collection of small projects, than one big one.And use \"patterns\" - you don't have to learn the \"official\" Design Patterns, most of them probably aren't relevant for your projects - but get used to \"doing things in a similar manner\", e.g. when having a UI module, use a similar architecture in every one of your projects, so you don't have to understand everything every time, but only focus on the differences.Finally, make sure you leave the projects in \"good standing\" - like if you had some real hobby projects in your workshop: clean up around them, put your tools back where they belong, make sure you don't have loose screws lying around, make small notes (TODO) of what you need to do next. Use git to track and document your progress, and make sure that every commit - or at least the last one before leaving the project - is a clean version that you know works, and doesn't have too many loose parts dangling about!",

You need to *practice yourself*.Further, focusing on the code is generally the wrong approach. Code is only the *end product* of a long train of decisions, thoughts, considerations, and planning. What happens *before* the actual code, the design, is what really counts.Sure, you may be able to implement X, but what's the reason to implement X in the way it is done? What are the design decisions and considerations that led to this specific implementation.You need to learn to *design*. You need to learn to sit down with a problem and to analyze and break it down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved individually and *then*, finally, be implemented in code (in any language you know).You, like way too many people, are trying to fast-track and are focusing too much on the end-product, instead of on the process of getting there.My recommendation is to not use AI to give you solutions of any kind (code or not does not matter), only to give deeper explanations, as a glorified \"google\".",

But you know what -- small study projects don't really teach you why Django or React is built the way it is anyway -- you only understand that on larger/complex/longer projects.If you're comfortable building working software without deep framework knowledge, that's actually okay. Many developers work this way now (and this started long before the raise of LLMs, trust me here).One thing I'd recommend to add to your current approach is the \\_\\_challenge\\_\\_. Don't just build a working calculator with ChatGPT, do it in under 15 minutes. Write an HTTP server in Typescript, a compiler in C and a 3D rendering engine in Python. Make every project more challenging than a previous one and you will quickly stop hesitating about ChatGPT over-reliance and start ranting about it's limitations and read the docs & dive into fundamentals because you have to.",

The first thing to do is calm down and don’t stress, this isn’t necessarily your fault, it’s the entire team’s fault. If someone acting non-maliciously can break something it’s a failure of the process, not a failure on the individual engineer. The best thing to do here is own up to the mistake and work with the entire team to recover it. It absolutely sucks to have to tell everyone about your mistake, but it’s always the best option to be transparent and lead the effort to fix it than to try and keep it quiet and hope no one notices, because if you do so it always turns into a bigger problem.Once you fix things, the next best thing is to write up a post-mortem report outlining what happened, the recovery process, the root cause, and any learning items or action items the team should take to avoid a similar incident from happening again.",

Here's the deal:You're right that coding isn’t just about syntax or solving tons of questions, it’s about learning to think computationally. That means breaking problems into smaller steps, organizing your logic, and gradually building up solutions. It’s a muscle, not a gift, and it takes time and the right kind of practice.Instead of rushing through LeetCode, start small and deliberately:Pick simple problems (like on Exercism, Codewars, Edabit, or even structured platforms like Dataquest) and write out your thought process before coding anything.Read “*How to Solve It”* by Polya, it’s not about code, but about how to approach problems methodically.Watch CS50 lectures (especially the problem-solving parts), and go through hands-on projects like “*Build Your Own X* “ when you're ready.Also, don’t panic when you get stuck. Practice tracing code with pen and paper, talking through your logic, and working with a study group or mentor if possible. Avoid relying on AI tools until you've tried solving it on your own first. They can short-circuit your growth if you're not careful.You're not broken mate, you're just now learning how to actually learn CS. And that realization? It's a huge win. Keep showing up, focus on depth over quantity, and the improvement will come.",

We have time to innovate so am thinking have a setup at least to future proof. But your point about the opportunity cost is valid.",

The only advice i can personally give is that it has been told to me that its okay to google some stuff when working. This is how you learn. You need to do something, you look for how to do it, and then next time you need to do it you know how. Make sure you're understanding why it works though and not just how to do it, thats a pitfall a lot of people fall into when learning anything. Also I personally dont use ChatGPT to write any code. If i use it its usually for syntax issues (usually when learning a new language) or as a substitute for google. Sorry I cant help more and im personally wondering the same question tbh. Its definetly hard to know when your competant enough to try and work in this field, but just make sure your always learning and try to always have fun doing it. :)EDIT: Typos",

You don't need to know everything as Google and AI exists (no programmer knows everything) but you need to build projects to learn how a project is constructed from start to finish and what is also important is that you don't use AI to solve problems. Struggling is part of the learning process and you only can learn debugging for example if your code, that you wrote yourself doesn't work and you go through it line by line trying to understand why the output is not what you want it to be. Like mentioned above theory is important too as you need to know that certain syntax even exists but then using this syntax so your brain gets used to it you can only learn by doing projects. Once you think you learned Javascript or Typescript for example (like you said you did), start a project and see if you know what to do. If the answer is you don't know then you need to spend more time with it until you can build a project yourself before moving on. I think even if you can get a job you will feel much more comfortable if you have done several projects. Like many here say, programming is not a sprint but a marathon. It takes a long time to learn properly.",

Developing a private-use plugin is much less work than developing something up to the standards for insertion into the public https://wordpress.org/plugins/ repository.You could even do this in just one php file. There's a starting point template for that in the \"Hello Dolly\" plugin here. https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/6.8.2/src/wp-content/plugins/hello.phpWordPress has a REST API subsystem that's set up so a plugin can extend it by adding one or endpoints to do what you need an API to do. https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/You can use short-lived access tokens (WordPress calls them \"nonces\") to authenticate access to your REST API. https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/nonces/ Your plugin will generate them as part of generating your web pages containing code that uses the REST API, and your REST API code will check them for validity. That way you don't have to put your long-lived API keys into your Javascript code in your users' browsers.",

You don't have time for one person to be very experienced while everyone else plays catch-up. Obviously this will be easier next year when you've had a year in your course and all know similar things. Picking a leader is less important than you think. You just need someone who's going to keep an eye on everyone and make sure everything moves forward. For the most part they just need to know what tasks are done and what needs to be done. If you're all first years, either one of you is going to be leagues ahead of everyone and they're a good choice, or no one is going to be considerably better than anyone else and it doesn't matter. The most important thing is keeping everything organised when dividing up work. If you're working in some web app, some of you should work on front end and some on back end, which you can divide based on everyone's experience. Use git to make sure you can easily share code between everyone and a tool like Trello to make sure everyone can see the tasks that still need doing. It's very easy with such tight deadlines for things to get messy.",

        "body": "Let's start by noting that not everyone understands the language of a problem description. Sometimes, things written in English still require translation into their native language. This is the first thing you can try.Then you can try solving the problem from two perspectives. Let's call them top-down and bottom-up.When solving from the top, you try to understand the highest layer of the problem, the business layer, from the solution's perspective, and then break it down into smaller problems, abstraction layer by abstraction layer.When solving from the bottom, you usually find some lowest problem to solve that you know you'll have to solve, and you build on it with successive steps upward. Sometimes you can create more such starting points and combine them into a single whole.I think solving from the top is easier and clearer, but I've also met people who solve from the bottom-up and were able to write code effectively.It's also worth trying to find solutions by analogy to already known solutions and the source code written for them. Here, you can use two sources, provided you can describe and connect the dots to the problem. One is the internet and its resources, and the trick is finding similar solutions. The second is looking at the code and finding similar implementations. For example, if you need to create a button with a message, and you already have another one somewhere in your application, you can see how it can be done, and that's a starting point for your own solutions.A final, but quite helpful, step is to write the documentation for the problem or function yourself. Not necessarily for the sake of maintaining it, but to understand the essence, clear your mind, and describe the problem. If you can't describe the problem, it's possible that what you're trying to do is intertwined with something else, insufficiently thought out, known, or documented. An example would be writing the documentation for a function before implementing it. If you can't write it, it's likely that you don't fully understand what you want to do. You might not be trying to implement one function, but two (or more) at once, and the problem isn't broken down into manageable components. Writing documentation, if successful, will force you to clarify what needs to be done, and implementation is then more of a detail.Some solutions also involve trial and error, retrospection, and retry. This happens, and don't be discouraged. Not everything can be built in one go.Summing up all the above, you'll definitely be trying to break the problem down into smaller components in some way, iteratively, step by step, until you reach a solution. Also, occasionally allow yourself to rest and sleep on the problem. Sometimes that helps too.",

My suggestions would be to:Break big tasks into tiny wins so you feel progress every day.Learn during work hours if you can, pair programming and code reviews speed things up.Don’t kill your workouts; short, consistent study sessions (30‑45 min a few nights a week) are better than long grinds.Ask questions early instead of spinning your wheels.Speed comes naturally once you know the codebase and focus on steady progress, not all‑nighters.I hope this helps you.",

Given you already have backend experience, it might be worth trying a small pivot instead of grinding the same path, maybe pick up a language like Python, which can open doors in areas like data engineering, AI/ML, or automation. It’s beginner‑friendly but still powerful enough for advanced work. You don’t have to ditch your current skills, just start with small side projects (APIs, data analysis scripts, ML tutorials) and see what clicks. Platforms like Dataquest, freeCodeCamp, and Real Python can give you a structured path. Sometimes, even a small change in what you’re learning can reignite growth and open new job options.",

But this also assumes that the candidate is able to consistently get through to have an actual interview with an actual person.In reality, few companies will even respond to your applications. I actually get a little thrill when I get a rejection email (I’d ballpark it at about 10% of my applications actually receiving a rejection). You have layers of AI filtering before you can even get to a human. And I can assure you that the AI filters do not care about the super exciting hike I went on last weekend even if it could create that moment of good vibes with a human that you are emphasizing.The hiring system IS adversarial. It’s turned into a sheer numbers game, a game of maximizing your odds of getting through the AI filters and still coming out vaguely believable on the other side. If I actually got a chance to speak with people regularly, I’d have a much different approach to how I apply, believe me. But I simply can’t afford to spend an hour retranslating my life experience into a bespoke application for every job listing when I know there is a very low chance anyone is even going to look at it and a lower chance I’ll beat out the other 300 people who applied for it within the first 5 minutes of it being listed.And while my heart goes out to all the gainfully employed hiring managers who find pressing a button to blanket filter out candidates a bit distasteful, I can assure you it feels infinitely worse on the other side where there are *actual* stakes (like can I feed my family next month).Again, I’m not trying to trash you or anything. I really do appreciate the tips and plan to make use of them as much as possible. But if you want people to act genuine in the hiring process, then the hiring process has to treat everyone like genuine people. And right now, I am VERY rarely treated like a genuine person.",

Asks me if I understand how public key cryptography works. I say sure, at a high level. He asks me to elaborate. I say something about factoring large multiples of two primes, trapdoor functions. Maybe I mumbled something about the Chinese remainder theorem and Fermat’s little theorem.This is for a genetic backend SWE position, mind you. Not one that would necessitate detailed knowledge of the math that supports public key.So then he asks me if I can lay out those two theorems for him and describe how they make public key possible. I say, “maybe, if you give me half an hour and a textbook”.That satisfied him. Apparently the whole thing was a psychological test designed to drill down on something the candidate says they know until they reach the end of their knowledge. You succeed by saying “I don’t know”. You fail by trying to bullshit an answer. Apparently one candidate was so pissed at being asked such detailed questions about topics unrelated to the role that he stormed out of the interview.",

I want you to think long and hard about the fact that this man, by lying about every single facet of his life, was not only able to have his resume seen, but waved past several rounds of hiring managers at all the biggest corps in silicon valley. You need to accept the fact that you've built a system that optimizes for exactly this type of candidate. Every problem that every hiring manager posts about on here has such obvious solutions that aren't being implemented. Every manager who posts on here about receiving too many applicants all seem to not want to just auto reject applications that are from outside the country. They all seem to not want to hire from whatever colleges or universities are near them. They all seem to want to have as much of the hiring process handled over zoom or by automation as possible. If you are a small bank in Omaha Nebraska that needs some entry level engineers and you list the job globally on indeed and zip recruiter rather than listing it on your company website and having your recruiter reach out to the local college for recent graduates then you deserve every single bullshitter and scammer who gums up your hiring process.",

I ask cause Ive been told by other SWEs to add more hard numbers which I can do, but it does feel hard knowing how to do it without feeling a little fake (capturing these metrics in production is not always clear). I don't really use AI for talking to people or in the interviewing process proper but it does feel like the job market is changing very quickly so it's hard to know what advice is still valid, especially as other people in the thread pointed out the best advice may be context dependent for where you're applying. Good post, I think it's really helpful getting a detailed perspective that fleshed out how people at startups may think differently about this problem!",

Used react on frontend, node.js on backend, hosted the site using Vercel and Railway. Later added a chatbot to interact with and talk about results.

Or is this only my observation?I think it really boils down to the fact that we have more specializations now and at the same time initial level required to host something >properly< has gone up so there's no real **point** in learning it without going really deep. I most certainly can spin up a VPS and run a basic stack on it, set up a firewall and add some fail2ban + basic logging.

No, AI doesn’t make you more productive: your gains are illusory, as AI takes easy typing exercises and turns them into hard debugging exercises. Third, Apple has products that normal people actually pay money for, and on which they make decent profit margins. This is not so for Google (an advertising firm in a time when online ads are having an apocalypse), Microsoft (a software firm in an era where people are less interested in paying for software), and Facebook (a scandal-plagued panopticon that provides minimal benefit to the public).

This is virtually unheard of at other FAANGs where the average tenure is HEAVILY right-skewed with the mean around a little over 12 months. Their interview process for most of their teams is intense (the ones I’ve done lasted around 7-10 rounds with rejections). They hire very little, and they subsequently fire very little. They also don’t seem to throw the kitchen sink at the newest and shiniest thing. From a financial perspective, Apple sits on one of the largest stockpiles of cash of all companies, they are sitting on about $50 billion in cash. This usually entails that the company is slow to exhaust resources. TLDR; they are conservative with their investments (into new projects and employees) and their hiring process is very selective.",

So if it's a role that's seen as below your pay-grade and it has little room for upward-mobility within the org, a lot of orgs will assume that you'll get bored and leave within a year or two and they'll have to start the process all over again. With some midsized orgs especially, their bureaucratic process likely means that the cost to hire is going to be impactful for them while they might not be big enough to want to undergo looking for a new person every year or two. With some of the new automated tools too, there's a bit of disconnect between hiring personnel and the people that you'd actually be working with. So the department the role is for might be looking for just a fresh college grad and might not care about experience while the hiring department has their tools set to only spit out the most ridiculously overqualified candidates for the role, which makes the process even more annoying. Source: was dealing with this at my university's infosec lab while I was working there. Basically the only way they could get candidates they actually wanted from hiring was to ask for the top 100 resumes because anything less than that only netted them ridiculously overqualified people or stupidly-keyword/context-heavy resumes (one of the ones they sent up to us was 14 pages long)",

Additionally, there needs to be some above and beyond benefit to doing it, like not a regularly scheduled release test, but something like getting an app feature complete before the end of the review period. It's easy to face my team and say something like: \"I'm going to work extra to ensure this gets done, it will make a big impact on my review, and you are all welcome to join me\". The idea is that you never directly ask, but align individual rewards with the project getting done sooner. The review stuff is still kind of BS, but it's still in our best interest to do well.Right now, I don't see what the difference is between you sacrificing family time over the weekend, and not sacrificing it is. You're 100% right when you say there is a process problem.One minor nit I have over your behavior: you committed to a weekend, but didn't actually commit or let your wife know. Putting the fact this is extra work aside, stuff like that is going to degrade your relationship with the manager a lot more than just saying \"no, I am busy with family obligations\" and leaving it at that.Either way, probably time to move on.",

I had to learn all these on the job. In CS, you're always learning on the job. Java 7 was mainstream when I started, now I see companies using Java 14 or later. The degree teaches you CS theory and fundamentals and proves you have some work ethic and coding ability. University prestige matters greatly for your first job.You can cycle back to CS and be entry level. The consulting industry won't care if you did something else for years but won't count that work experience. I'm not sure the job market is going to be any better. Unless I see proof of CS declining below [100,000 degrees per year](https://archive.is/mPNcX) in North America, I just see the squeeze tightening.Business minor, I think you saw that you can't list minors on job applications. Got to upsell during a job interview. At least you have MBA prereqs knocked out. Perhaps you could manage CS in the future. Nice that you know how to code but won't disagree with the devs on how long things take. Worst manager is a rusty coder who acts like they're not rusty. I had some database polite disagreements.",

Some spent many more years learning the craft and struggling for a job before finding success. If she really wants this, keep encouraging and tell her to stick it out, but be prepared to work harder for longer. She needs to be ready to take a job she doesn't like.

Anytime he & I discussed growth opportunities like promotions or raises, he'd put the burden squarely on me with some rambling about how I \"needed more visibility\". As if that's something I had the agency over, instead of him.When he left, I asked his bosses if he had ever, in the multiple years he was my manager, communicated some of my key wins or feelings of performing above my role/paygrade.He had not. Ever.Told them I required a comp adjustment & role change or I'd have to start looking for other work, and it worked out.Just my anecdotal experience, but maybe you could also potentially benefit from putting your foot down and insist on moving upwards, rather than asking what you should be doing next.",

If those things change, then stocks will decline. Maybe declining stocks mean more layoffs, but they could also signal hiring as companies scramble to get employees back to fix things.Hiring or firing is dependent on market conditions, not just valuation of stock. This post is just more doomerism without any actual analysis behind it. A declining market could see firings, or it could see hirings. It depends on what causes the market decline and what resources companies have banked when it begins. These are not known things, unless you have a crystal ball.",

There's also value in the risk that they take to find new contracts that their cut is paying for that you don't feel because you only get the final job. From my own experience, the people going on these job pitches get paid more than the devs and it takes time for them to land jobs.So you're essentially paying the contract firm 36% of your total billing to avoid all that. It's not outrageous. I've seen my own billings when I did contracting and they were doing in excess of 50% at times.",

        "body": "It sounds like you are in front of a fork in the road for your career. Ultimately, you gotta decide what is it that you want to do. I recommend that you don’t prioritize what you love or are passionate about. Obviously it is amazing if you love/are passionate about your career, but that does not give you much flexibility. It’s fine if you don’t stay in CS/SWE, but I think the answer for leaving should be more nuanced than “it’s not my passion”.So to dig into that a bit deeper, why did you get into software development 6 years ago? Have the reasons back then changed? You mentioned that sometimes you wish you never had to look at code again, is there a specific reason why? Are those reasons innate to coding itself or the conditions of your workplace? One way you can test that question is by trying to learn some fundamental computer science theory. TBF this is an assumption, but I strongly suspect your bootcamp set you up to learn programming languages and frameworks and it didn’t teach you the fundamentals and theory of computer science. I think that’s important to learn in order to develop some passion since it makes the field an actual study, not a traded skill.I’ll use history as an example since that was your major. A lot of people don’t like history because they see it as just the practice of accounting of the events that happened in the past. To them, it feels like there’s “history” and there’s “current events” and the two aren’t connected much in their view. But a historian will understand how history is both a representation of the past and current events. They understand how history gives us a critical basis for evaluating human sociology, economics, politics, etc.There’s an analogous experience that a SWE can have with coding and computer science. It’s obviously not going to get nearly into humanities studies like history, but its conceptualizations extend in their own ways in surprising ways.If you read this and think “I really don’t care about any of that and I have no will to invest my time in that”, that’s totally fair and it would give you important feedback for your dilemma. At the end of the day, whether you are passionate about it or not, you gotta have a mind that is curious to explore your professional field. If your mindset is similar to that as a cashier who doesn’t wish to expand their skillset in retail, then you’ll remain stagnant just as a cashier will. It may feel like you shouldn’t be stagnant since you obviously work in a field that requires more skills than being a cashier. But stagnation isn’t about where you are currently. It’s about how you are growing. TL;DR: Try to invest more time in learning CS fundamentals and theory to see if it will give you a new perspective for finding interests in this field. If it doesn’t or you do not want to do that, then you’ll remain stagnant should consider what would you be willing to do that for and how can you make a career with that.",

I do not think of work as \"productive time\" vs something else. If management wants me to sit in meetings then I will do that to the detriment of something else.

Two were with engineers, each technical but only pretty basic coding and mostly conversational. Then a final call with the engineering department director. It's a <100 person company, maybe 30 engineers.It's by far the shortest / least intense interview I've gone through, and I pretty much only interview for companies around that size or smaller. Most everywhere does 4+ rounds if you're including the intro call, but more than 5 is pretty unusual, and I am including \"take home exercise\" as a round.Most typical interview loops are:* Recruiter screen* Hiring manager screen* Technical round (often a take home)* Deeper technical round (common if last was a take home)* Final call with someone important (CTO, director, etc)Step 3 is *super* common when compared to 2020-2022, but sometimes rounds 2-3-4 there are combined in some way. Occasionally there will be no final round and it goes right to offer stage after the big technical round. It's also pretty common for the deep round to just be a discussion of the take home.Shortest I've ever had was screen, conversational with HM, then a technical. After that was offer phase. 3 rounds was more common in 2015-2020, I think, but I've found that losing the in-person technical round to remote interviewing has made the process longer pretty much across the board.",

If you're interviewing for a medium-sized company (100-500 employees, I don't go smaller as the pay will be much lower), you will have 2 interviews: a technical one with a one to three engineers and a behavioural on-site one with an HR and probably someone ranking between your future team lead to the head of development. The technical interview REALLY depends on the company. I'm interviewing for C++ positions, so the company will ask you questions about the non-trivial part of the language most relevant to them (examples are virtual methods, exceptions, thread synchronization, templates, stuff like that). They will also ask you general language and data structure questions(examples: the differences between map and unordered_map and between list and vector), and they might throw a leetcode-like problem in to see whether you understand concepts like big-O notation. Some companies can also ask you a bunch of really low-level questions where you'll need to know about alignment, big-endian vs little-endian, and the C standard library.The behavioural interview is the basic HR questions(like \"what was your biggest fuckup?\" and \"why are you switching jobs?\"). One company I worked at gave me a personality test, but it was a legit one developed by scientists for professional orientation purposes, not something like MBTI(and the company itself was really nice and chill). The entire process takes 2-3 weeks. They can even come with the positive feedback on the day of the interview. Then they give you a couple of weeks to think about their offer. The job afterwards is usually much more chill than in our Big Techs.",

Many smaller shops are still struggling to find solid mid-level developers, especially those willing to work with \"boring\" stacks like PHP, .NET, or legacy systems. The AI hype has actually created opportunities since many devs are chasing trendy roles elsewhere.However, even small companies have tightened their hiring processes. While you might avoid the FAANG-style leetcode gauntlets, expect 2-3 rounds minimum and probably a small take-home project. The 200+ applicant pools are more common now, but your experience and realistic salary expectations could set you apart from fresh bootcamp grads demanding Silicon Valley wages.Regional markets vary significantly. Smaller cities and non-tech hubs often have less competition and more reasonable processes. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search while you're still in your current situation. Local consulting firms, government contractors, and established businesses modernizing their systems are good targets.Your timing might actually work in your favor. Many companies are pulling back from over-hiring and focusing on steady, experienced developers who can maintain existing systems rather than rockstars building the next unicorn.

I was a paper millionaire. YEAH BABY I'M RICH!!! Yeah not so fast, lol.This happened right as the bubble started to deflate. By the time I had vested 1/4 of my options and could sell anything, the stock price fell 35-40%. And it kept on falling and falling and falling. Layoffs started happening, and by the time my number was called, about 7/8 months later, about 60% of employees had been let go. Stock price was in the toilet. But my strike price was really low, so it was still something. From my several millions on paper, I ended up getting about $75K out of it. Not horrible. That would be worth about $150-160K today. Not life changing money, but enough to put a downpayment on a couple of houses. Which in turn appreciated to where it is life changing money. So indirectly I guess I did get those millions.Once I was laid off, I chilled out for about 2 months, I played a lot of golf. I got a pretty good severance package, IIRC 3 months of salary and health insurance for 6 months. Or maybe the other around. It was 20+ years ago I don't remember all the details. I wasn't really worried about money as I had lived fairly frugally and socked away a lot. Plus I had the option money.I ended up moving to a LCOL mid sized city and got a job there. My salary was much lower than what I had been making before. But accounting for the difference in cost of living as well as taxes (I moved from ultra high tax state to ultra low tax state) I was right about even.It was a wild ride and it was exciting. It was a place and time that was special. I loved the experience. Plus I met so many people back then that I am still in touch with today. One of them started a company himself. He asked me to join, I would have bene employee 4 or 5, something like that. I passed thinking, dude no way this will ever become anything, look around you tech is dead. That company was later sold to Microsoft for MUCHO MUCHO money. Oh well, win some lose some.",

And I never intended to follow him into it lol.Aside from the personal trauma though, giving up on his tech career was clearly a stupid financial decision.

It's feeding into a regime that I will withhold my feelings about so as not to get too political, but suffice it to say I vehemently disagree with.My brother, none of these problems were ever meant to fall on the shoulders of one person. And, nothing is new under the sun. These are problems that have existed since the beginning of time. They are just in the 2025 dressings.We've always experienced gluttony of the elite at the expense of regular people, greed, power and violence. However, we've also always done stuff like chop their fucking heads off :)It's a cycle as old as time. Notice that you feel a strong sense of purpose and that's a great thing, lean into that. But be aware that our brains were not meant for the flood of information we get on a daily basis. We were meant for a village, not 17 notifications before lunch from Aaron Parnas all beginning with \"We have some major breaking news..\"Hang in there OP. Remember your thoughts shape the reality you live in. Focus on the 10% of roles that perhaps aren't jobs that are deporting puppies to the edge of a volcano (though this will be hard to find).",

Do what you can to secure what money/housing/investments you can long term, and exit the corporate wasteland as soon as feasibly possible and either use your skills to help smaller companies compete against the giants, work for ngos and organizations figting this cultrural move to worldwide oligarchy (which frankly isnt a new move and has been around as long as humans had cities so idk but its still a noble cause), teach coding and software to kids and younger adults to help them rise out of poverty2.

To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. these are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau. I personally heavily leveraged these and went from junior to senior in under 2 years, getting promoted over solely technical engineers with 3-4x my experience. for these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss more. I am an open book!",

But at 4 years, idk. I’m in a similar position to you, 3.5 years in and officially considered mid, but I know I offer much more than that. But I’ve got a pretty good deal all things considered, so I’ve let go of any resentment and just contribute as much as I need and not extra, unless absolutely required (I’m not very visible, but sometimes I might be when other teammates are out). Basically, I prefer being an IC vs. leading projects because there’s much less scrutiny and the routine is much more chill. I even talked to a teammate who is leading a project, and they’re questioning whether the visibility is worth it lol. I’ve had the chance in the past and I knew that it’s not something I’m into. I also keep up with the latest advancements in the field, primarily in terms of AI.

So that's why they describe it as mere hype and grift. They tell themselves this because they want it to be true.But I don't think you need to get into LLMs to have a good career. However, as I am in the field myself, more and more of your projects will probably increasingly have some kind of LLM component. At a certain point, you'd actively have to avoid LLMs if you want to stay in ML but not work on them, which might limit your opportunities.",

I’ll warn that to someone with my level of experience it’s obvious that this sub is full of people who are barely into their career, and people who have done very little research into other careers.I can get another job easily even in this economy. It would be hard to get a job that pays as much as my current job does, but I’d still be making at least $180k. There’s very, very few other careers that can say something similar short of becoming a doctor. The reality is that becoming a software engineer is still one of your best options.Breaking into this career is hard. But so is breaking into most careers worth pursuing, and at the end other options will generally offer lower rewards than this one. If you network well, apply seriously and broadly, and do proper interview prep, eventually you’ll land something. I started out in a QA role that paid me less then my pizza delivery job, now I make nearly $300k.Far too many people in this sub preach about how you have to be passionate about software. That’s bull. The majority of the highly successful engineers I know, I’m talking people making over $300k, are very transparent they are only in it for the money. Passion isn’t a requirement. Being willing to work hard is. If anything the passionate people were the ones who tend to get suckered into longer hours and lower pay.The only career people can even try to compare with the perks of software engineering is the trades, and that’s largely coming from people who don’t know much about the trades and are parroting what they’ve heard. The trades, on average, don’t pay nearly as much as software engineering. There are some exceptions, but even those tend to only pay the level of highly skilled senior software engineers, if we compare them to the exceptions for software engineers then engineering pay still generally blows the trades out of the water.Trade jobs that pay well are also highly competitive, trade jobs are limited to in person job opportunities, they’re incredibly hard on your body, they often require long hours, and they are rampant with sexism such that it’s hardly even a real option for women. Depending on where you live your race might also be a problem for the trades. If it were as easy to make a ton of money in the trades as some people pretend it is then everyone would do it. Yeah things are hard for software engineers now, but things are hard for everyone now. Computer science is still likely the best career for people willing to do the work. I’m not saying computer science will be easy. I’m saying nothing worth pursuing will be.",

Here are the things you need to know, not immediately but keep them in mind:1. New tech is always coming out, so you have to be comfortable constantly learning. For example, you should absolutely be taking classes about AI, ML, and LLMs in college. 10 years from now, there will be something else. You can’t just sit on knowledge in this field like in other fields, you have to keep learning or you get left behind. 2. Microsoft tech stack isn’t used many places outside of government. Focus on Python and/or Java, as they are the two most popular in the real world. Learn fullstack eventually so you understand how the systems interact. 3. Learn system design. You will learn more about the components in college, the earlier you learn this the better. Hellointerview is really good for this. 4. Obviously DSA is critical. You need to be very comfortable with this. You will learn it in college, but getting started early can’t hurt. Lots of resources online. 5. Learn cloud. Again, Microsoft tech isn’t used much. AWS is king, followed by google cloud. I would recommend learning AWS. You don’t have to be an expert but learn how to use it and what the different parts do. 6. Make a GitHub account and work on projects. Especially anything cloud related and/or AI related. 7. Don’t buy CS books (except school books). Everything you need can be found online, for free. 8. I would recommend taking computer engineering instead of computer science, if you can. It’s half CS and half electrical engineering. You will learn how both the software and hardware work together, and if you decide you like hardware better, you can easily pivot to EE.9. Learn CI/CD fundamentals. Again, you don’t have to be an expert, but understanding how real releases to production work will help you be a more mature software engineer. Be comfortable setting up a build in something like Jenkins or Azure DevOps, for example. 10. Learn version control. Git is by far the most popular. ——Maybe I’ll add more if I think of anything else. But yeah, don’t get discouraged. There are definitely lots of people looking for jobs but it’s a great field and pays very well. You are always learning new things and always challenged, and you get to work with smart people.",

Had I known that it would've been hit as hard as it did, I would've gone into something else (probably medical or another engineering discipline). I will say that I do love coding, and a huge caveat is that I love frontend coding but don't care too much about being hands-on with backend/ML. The market is catered towards backend/ML and honestly wouldn't be surprised if frontend engineers specifically gets hit even more. So, as other people have commented, if you truly are passionate and dedicate yourself to fundamentals (use AI as a TOOL, not a solution!), then it will definitely pay off. I'm someone who is big in the life part of WLB, and I can say that this field doesn't really cater towards those type of people.",

Senior people would give talks to their teams about how they are leaders, and not managers, presumably after attending a workshop.There's a nugget of truth to the distinction, but in practice your manager/leader is unlikely to change how they behave based off of what they learned about \"leadership\".

Some very large companies (eg: Oracle) ran HR on a skeleton crew and automated system before generative AI was even a thing. I think at some point they had a single digit headcount HR team for the entire company. Also, job cuts don't say the whole story. Eg: at my company (which is admittedly much smaller) we cancelled hiring for some positions because we could replace them with AI (and did, quite successfully). We didn't let anyone go over it, but those are still jobs that would have existed otherwise.",

I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. No one cares about or looks at projects. HR doesn't code and is the first line of filtering resumes. Hiring managers have 30 hours of meetings a week. They probably don't even read your resume before the interview.For every 1 person who says they look at projects, there's many more who don't. My hiring manager in banking said projects can only hurt the applicant because you can't defend yourself when someone good looking to judge you. I don't list my GitHub. Projects are fine to teach yourself tech stacks but no need to share the code.Oh 1,500 MAU app, like that's different, that's not some crap project copied off the internet or weirdly coded with AI. Is there not a website or App store listing you can link? But yeah, you're still entry level with 300-1000 applications for every job. You say \"top public school\" but that needs to be #1 or #2 in your state. Then you need to be willing to relocate.Consider forming an LLC to look more legit for self-employed status and mention revenue if over $500. I'm not a lawyer, not giving legal advice.Your resume, you underestimate how lazy HR is. **They read your resume for** [7-8 seconds](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/). You need to say what languages were used in your first two projects. Most people don't know what Flutter is. Then you need to expand your Technical Skills. Don't just say Java, add Spring Boot, Postgres with JDBC, Hibernate mapping, other Spring modules, any IDEs used. If same info is within your Java project, that's fine, have it in two places so HR is more likely to read.Then consider an MS to \"reset\" your work gap and be eligible for internships again. [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech is legit and cheap but you miss out on in-person career fairs where I got all my entry level opportunity.",

Unless you're the type of SWE that has their pick of the litter that early. Depending on your experience/qualifications, maybe even be open to that for 5-6 years.Otherwise, I'd probably start becoming desperate enough to involuntarily relocate around the 4-6 month mark. It's also important to point out how the job search itself is going would change how desperate I am.... Am I not even getting interviews? I'd be very desperate, I'd be open to relocating on the earlier side. Am I getting interviews, but just not offers? This is significantly easier to fix, I'd be working on this in month 1, let alone month 4... but if I'm getting a decent amount of bites I'd be freaking out closer to the 6 months mark.At that stage I also wouldn't *only* be open to relocating. I'd be expanding my job search to consider non-SWE roles that my CS degree qualifies me for. Moving into QA, PM, IT, etc can get me on my feet, get an income into my bank account, and give me more time to look for a SWE role.Much more than 6 months unemployed... I'd need to have a long, hard conversation with myself about my career. That's a long time to be involuntarily unemployed in any market. I'm way past the \"maybe I should relocate\" stage.Where I'm at now in my life, with 12 YOE, there's only 2 cities in the country I'd be open to relocating to. I'll soft-retire before I move somewhere I don't want to live.",

        "body": "Hmmm... it's actually the opposite for me.I knew I wanted to pursue a degree in CS very, very early on. In 5th grade we had to write a report and publically present it about \"What I want to be when I grow up\". A bunch of kids picked things like professional baseball player, firefighter, cop, \"business man\", etc.I wrote my report on wanting to be a \"Computer Scientist\".I wasn't even pursing SWE specifically. I wanted to get a CS degree, and find *any* technical job that utilized my CS degree. So from day 1 I was ride-or-die CS/tech-industry.But around 10-12 years into my career, my mind has started drifting to simpler times. When I was a teenager, I worked in fast food, and it was one of the best jobs of my life. I literally met life long friends through that job that I still keep in touch with. It's what really brought me out of my shell as an awkward teen, it was pretty formative for my life.The pay was shit, dealing with customers is god awful, but the job itself was very \"zen\". I go in, I sling some burgs for 6-12 hours, and I go home. There's no week/month-long projects, there's no quarterly objectives, there's no product managers, there's no on call, there's nothing to think about after work. It's just burgers. The only thing that followed me after my shifts was I always smelled like beef.But around 10 YOE? I already got my bag. I literally have enough money stashed away that I could afford to work a full time minimum wage job for the rest of my life and not sacrifice anything about my current lifestyle. So when my last job went south, and I started looking for my current one.... I kept thinking \"what if I just... went back to fast food\". I made a spreadsheet to forecast my runway.Ultimately I'm glad I stuck with it and landed my current job.... but I am at the point where if I get laid off, or this job goes south, \"soft-retiring\" is a very realistic option for me.My passion in CS and computers is still as strong as ever. But I don't need to work in the industry to enjoy that side of my life anymore.",

        "body": "Most people on this sub are young, so they won't have any real understanding of careers beyond traditional college -> entry level job pipelines.But what I would do from your position is extremely different than that. Instead of trying to cram yourself into that box, I would lean into the advantages of your position and away from the disadvantages you have in the traditional entry level pipeline.I would think about your plant very deeply, and find problems within the plant that are technology problems. I would then prioritize them by a combination of how valuable they are to the business (like how much they move earnings), how much delivery of that thing would prove your ability as a technology leader, and how personally interested I was in the project.For example, if you are having problems with missing inventory, you could implement a better system for tracking the most critical inventory, perhaps integrated with internet connected scales/computer vision/whatever other systems you have for estimating counts and visualizing internal logistics. I would propose this fundamentally be a data warehouse, dbt sql transforms, and metabase, with a cloud function for collecting input data from sensors, but do whatever works.I would then just build it, prove it works, and get the company to use it. Don't try to get paid for it first. Just build it and make it work really well. Do that a couple times, and start leaning on leverage from the company depending on you for more things, only after they are indeed dependent on you, to change at least your title, if not your entire role. Ideally, hire an experienced software engineer or two, empower them with the leverage you built up, while you humbly learn from them, as a kind of servant leader.Now, you have the leverage of the labor market at the \\*leadership\\* level, which is a way better place to be, not the junior level which is a shit show. Maybe that leverage leads you to running technology teams at that company, or maybe you actually exercise it to join somewhere else. Regardless, that is \\*exactly\\* the kind of story that sells people into tech leadership roles, not a CS degree.This is more or less what everyone I know who is outlier successful in tech did. Ignore the concept of job titles and norms around career pathways, focus on creating value, use that value to create leverage, use that leverage to both empower yourself to create more value and capture value, after there is a lot of value.Almost no one on this sub will understand this because most are like 23, have no established leverage in a business with which they could do this, nor time to have done it, nor connections with leadership to have understood how things get done at that level.The other pro is that it's no longer either/or. You are hedged the whole time by keeping your current job.The core insight is that hiring managers are just looking for evidence that you can deliver requirements in their business. There is no stronger evidence than having already done that at a business. A 22 year old can't convince an established business to work with them to make that evidence with them. You probably can.",

Some things I did:I slowed down how fast I spoke. This helped me think more before I speak.I also started getting comfortable with the pauses. You DON'T have to constantly keep speaking. If you feel you are losing track of thought, just slow down, recollect your thoughts and then speak. Most people think you need to keep talking and in such cases use weird filler words which end up sounding less authoritative.Use these documents that I spoke about in the post. For eg a quick 1-pager doc that highlights what you want to discuss basically acts as a meeting agenda and lays down all the things that need to be discussed - that way you don't have to remember / memorize anything. If that is too much, then just note down the main points that you want to discuss on a sticky note or something. In my experience, if I have a clear structure that helps me navigate from one point to another, I have less chance to lose track of thought.Lmk if that helps.

Work experience - This is the absolute most important section and should be the largest of all the sections.2. Projects - These can sometimes be valuable, but more often than not are overlooked. It's too easy to copy/paste someone else's projects or vibe-code some half-assed slop.3. Skills - This should be a very small section with all the tech keywords in the prior two sections.4. Education - This should be a very small section as well. Anyone with half a brain cell can get a CS degree. It's so easy to cheat your way through it.Overall, work experience is king. It's the only thing on a resume that recruiters consider reliable.",

Work on those, ask quesitons, etc but at the same time: \\- Learn the version control system / branching strategy / release schedule / rollback policies etc better than anyone else in the organization. You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books. Learn everything about Java, be able to talk about the major features that were added at various milestones and why you would use them. Same with Spring or whatever else you're using.",

The certification itself hasn't really done much for me from a promotion/increase in salary perspective, but I do credit my rapid career trajectory largely to me getting certified at the start. It gave me a really deep understanding of Java which in turn gave me confidence, which is a crucial thing to have at any point in your career. In addition to the added confidence, most things build upon the core foundation of Java, so building a solid foundation provides better opportunity for continued growth.",

Maybe set up a server at home with redis since you're primary a front end. Cloud certs are just an extension of this.

Simply being active in meetings and sending follow up emails in the format of this book allowed me to lead projects early in my career 1 and 4 can be done in a few months.

Here's just a few:\\- I have been working on projects X, Y, and Z \\- I tried to build X startup/business and it isn't working out \\- I've been (or have been pursuing) freelancing/contracting and am looking for a little more stability \\- My last job wanted me to relocate/move/return to office and I didn't want to \\- I wanted to learn more about X, Y, and Z technology, field, or domain (and I wasn't able to do so at my previous role) \\- I've been going to school/helping my family/caretaking/whatever \\- I wanted to travel the country/the world and so I took my chance to do soYou can mix and match these as you see fit and add whatever spice you want (for example if your last job was in the city you live in now, you probably can't say \"I didn't want to relocate\"). Personally I have a million interests and side projects and hobbies and things I want to learn (both in and out of software) so it really isn't hard for me to answer this question with confidence, but obviously that depends, again, on you. Nobody can answer the question for you and there's not one magical answer.\"Judging you for something that isn't your fault\" is what the world is made of brother. I'm not sure what you think a hiring process is but it is very much people looking for reasons not to hire people. You need to give them strong signals that you're worth hiring that override those negative signals. A 6 month - 1 year gap is easily overcomeable if you look like you have stayed engaged with software development, have a portfolio, interview well, etc.Definitely do NOT say \"I've essentially been unengaged\"",

The \"vibes-based\" performance reviews are particularly concerning red flags.Don't let one dysfunctional workplace convince you to abandon an entire career. Most tech teams aren't like this, and your methodical approach suggests you actually have good instincts for the field. Your current situation is damaging your confidence unnecessarily, and the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember that this isn't normal or acceptable.Start job searching immediately while you still have income.

It's very much a class based masters and the majority of students don't do any research. If your goal is to find advisors, ones who can write the type of letters that get you into grad school, you can certainly do that. I'd ask on r/OMSCS for stories, but I know it's possible.I was also interested in Type Theory (Haskell programmer at the time) and unfortunately I didn't find any faculty working on that. I wasn't going back to grad school (did that once), though, and my main focus for doing the program was to get a better grip on CS fundamentals and help grow my industry career. For that, it was extremely effective and I got into big tech pretty soon after graduating. I did find this: [https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities](https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities) I'd check that out. All that said, the way I got into a PhD program was by working for a professor as a lab tech, doing good work, and getting into the program hosted by the school. To get into a PhD program, grades and papers help, but what it really comes down to is one professor with influence speaking on your behalf. If you push, that should be possible with OMSCS.",

There are great professors - Joyner, Jeff Wilson, Jay Summet - who would be willing to write a letter if you do well in the class and are active in discussions and office hours.The biggest difference between in person and online is that you get out what you put in in terms of social interaction.

I mostly want to do the Masters for myself and I assume any reasonable CS Masters probably carries *enough* weight for job market purposes. Juts not sure if maybe OMSCS might actually be the safer route job-wise (I'll probably still just go to Stony Brook but wanted to collect the info).",

A lot of people go through the program and talk about how difficult it is, so graduating is generally seen as an accomplishment. We have a slack channel at work, and right now there's a few other people going through the program.The only caveat I'd give, is that OMSCS is course based, not thesis based, so if you're looking for the masters to qualify you to do some specific type of dev work, like distributed systems or databases, it might be harder since you won't have a lot of project based experience on that one specific thing.As for just a general qualification, it's definitely good enough for industry roles like FE, BE, full stack, infrastructure/platfor, product. I have a biology undergrad, was working as a Haskell programmer at a small start up, and 2 years after graduating I made it to a big tech company with pretty good pay.

Guess where their loyalty is going to be?* Their job is to do an initial screening based on JD and hand over the candidate for interviews. In most cases, JD's are too generic and weak, hence they end up screening candidates without the right profile.* Recruiters aren't tecnical. Don't expect them to explain the JD or job with you or give you tactical advice - other than basic fluff about the company you can get on Reddit or their websitePro tip: Learn to read JD and tailor your resume with the keywords mentioned (if you really have the experience).

But they're not at all useful for anything related to regression, time series, anomaly detection, etc. except as a feature engineering tool. If you want to move away from LLMs, look for a job in those domains like fraud detection, forecasting, etc. Or better yet, you could even try searching for specific phrases like that on LinkedIn to see if non-LLM API calling jobs show up.",

Most companies today are shipping products faster via LLM APIs, so roles that once demanded model training and debugging have been flattened into integration-heavy workflows. That said, the deeper work still exists just in more focused places: research teams, model pre-training groups, infra/startup labs, or proprietary AI stack builders.If you’re not seeing these roles on portals, it’s likely because they’re less advertised and more network-driven. You’re not burnt out you’re underutilized. Consider targeting orgs building from scratch (e.g., open-source foundation models, RLHF stacks, or custom embedding workflows) where your skill set is still a competitive advantage. Happy to point you to a few such paths if you're open.",

Also finance is a bit more old fashioned when it comes to hiring but that’s changing with newer firms being run like more akin to tech companies. Start grinding LeetCode and probably even CodeForces.

I thought it was the coolest thing ever so I wanted to see how they did it, poked around in the files and made changes to see what would happen. I was hooked from that point on, and every time my mom had a day off I would ask her to take me to the bookstore so I could read the programming books, and I would jot down notes in a notebook and bring it back home to try on our computer.So out of your categories, I’d say it was passion and talent. It never felt like I was working hard, but that’s really just because I lived and breathed it every waking hour I didn’t have to spend on school. By the time they started offering programming classes at school I was in high school and had been programming for maybe 5 years, so the classes were just really easy and I just stayed ahead of the curve my whole academic career. I got a high school job doing web dev for a small tax accountant and kept working at various companies during college so there was never a question of not knowing if I had what it takes, I already was doing the work and getting paid for it.",
