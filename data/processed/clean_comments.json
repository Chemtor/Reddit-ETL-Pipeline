        "body": "I have a recent real world example of this, I think.I work with data from social media platforms. Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.Also new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.For almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025My point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders? It’s great that you’re working with sources with well-defined schemas, but social media platforms do not keep things consistent for long, always introducing and redefining metrics and post types. Keep all the columns.",

We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.The Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.Notice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.What’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.What stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. So while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.Another benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.A nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",

        "body": "Ways I would tackle it:1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)You add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.Whenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.Most relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.This would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)For “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.You break it into N shards: UPDATE comment_counter_shards SET shard_count = shard_count + 1 WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)To read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.This solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)Maintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).Feed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.Each 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.I am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.UPDATE: Some more thoughts:To keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).You accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).Also worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.But if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)Anyways, its weekend. Going for some mountain touge with my Miata :D Peace out :victory_hand:P.S. I run [AI/software studio](https://famouslabs.org) and I am open for work - whether its data, MVPs or custom software.

Different versions of Python is really the more annoying thing there. I've never minded Python overall though. It's good at what it does in the data space. Like any language, a bad dev can find ways to write bad code. I'd guess that your issues debugging it are largely do to design choices and a lack of familiarity with Python itself. I will say though that I still generally prefer to do transformations in SQL and using Python as more of a glue language.",

Python + proper libraries + proper coding guidelines, can be safe enough and efficient enough for DE. Kind of like SQL, Python is often used as UI for a more efficient tool like Polars calling Rust code or Spark calling Scala/Java code.However, when possible, I prefer to use established frameworks like the Dagster orchestrator, dbt for transformation or some extraction tools like airbyte or dlt. The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution. I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.Scala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.So for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay. It's rather a question of which part should be coded from scratch and which part should use a higher level framework.",

Python is a very easy language to get up and running with, which is (in my opinion) why people who aren’t Software Engineers (ie data analysts/scientists) use it. Since it’s used so much by them, the data ecosystem ends up using it a lot in general, so it then bleeds over to tools used by actual engineers.I personally loathe python for basically the same reasons you outlined. It’s great for writing scripts (I’d much rather write python than bash), but we use Spark a lot at my job, so for ETL jobs I’d MUCH rather write Scala.",

Doing this same sort of thing in other languages is much harder and almost immediately devolves into an explosion of complexity that can quickly become very hard to maintain and understand. Other languages are all fine and good when all your data is super well behaved and you have control of it at every layer. Python really is the goat for handling flaky weird sorts of stuff coming from systems outside of your control. This is why Python has largely won this particular race. Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.That said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects. Then your actual business logic Python code can simply check that it receives an object of the type it expects irrespective of internal complexity of those objects and their construction.",

I can extract those KPIs, I can identify interesting things in data and expose them to consumers.

Very few in between.I also have a more elaborate, interactive task to check their ability to write classes and work with `@property`/`@....setter`. By elaborate I mean we start simple and at each stage I add a complication, like \"let's pretend addition is a very computationally expensive operation. How can we refactor this code to avoid unnecessary addition?\".I might ask them what sorting algorithm is built into python, or how does python allocate memory when growing lists.",

Any transformation at all could be used to create a gold layer.The gold layer is either the deliverable itself, or it feeds directly into the deliverable; say in the case of it being the training set for a machine learning algorithm. The gold layers is the thing you are fundamentally trying to create from a business requirements standpoint. It could involved joining multiple silver tables, it could involve melting or combining rows, it can involve domain-specific feature engineering, it can involve changing the units of measure or the time zone, it can involve scaling or weighting values.

        "body": "I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).Inmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an \"operational data store\". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: \"subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data\". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.This actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using \"conformed dimensions\". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).Inmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.Edit:typos",

Inmon is more effort up front to capture the business in 3rd normal form promoting better integrity and consistency for the longer term. This is why it’s rarely seen (comparatively), as many businesses can’t justify the overhead and see more immediate reward with Kimball (despite the potential long term technical debt this creates).",

Storage is cheap and columnar databases don't care how wide tables are so there often isn't a reason to go further than that. My company uses a dimensional model for one of our areas, but it makes sense because we have a lot of cross subject calculations and rates to do, so conformity helps ensure that the data is flexible and accurate. Another data area just uses \"one big table\" (OBT) to store billions of events in wide tables. So understand what the approaches give you and use what makes sense.",

        "body": "> orbits/predictions that would require going through the entire database more than once to establish relationships between planets/stars and calculate distances based on multiple columns and making sub queries based on the resultsThis aspect sounds like you want to step out of SQL for some steps, or at least generate intermediate tables. Generating a subquery based on the results of another query isn't really how CTEs work - a CTE just creates a view or 'virtual table' that you can query from. The 'going through the entire database more than once' sounds like you want to do some kind of iterative work, where you want to save the results at each step and move on.This doesn't necessitate using a particular DB, but you might want to think about how you would approach some of these things in another language. Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.You would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be bestIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.If you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.> The best database option that would basically be read only...This mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.If postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.SQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.If most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.Or, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.---In general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.If any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read. Every one of these can write data out to parquet ([duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/file_formats/parquet_export.html), [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.LazyFrame.sink_parquet.html), [daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/dataframe/#daft.DataFrame.write_parquet).",

You could export and compress with parquet although I'm not sure it'll be any smaller than PG's internal storage compression.[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/performance/how\\_to\\_tune\\_workloads.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/performance/how_to_tune_workloads.html)DuckDB supports spilling to disk but I think the internal data structures and access methods an In Memory Database like Duck or SQLite uses is very different from a disk based database that also has a memory buffer pool in RAM. Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.Doing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).Now I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe* you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.Edit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. Actually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\\_duck[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",

In any reasonable use-case we would assume that:a) a large chunk of historical data exists, andB) new data is regularly produced. So how will you handle both? One solution is to set up a timer that pulls in new data every 5 minutes and a queue with all the csv files in the history.Sounds straight forward: you can just spin up all the lambdas you need, each will do a little piece of work and the blob storage can easily handle tons of writes at the same time. But can pyiceberg handle two writers at the same time? \"Iceberg uses Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) which requires failed writers to retry.\", I wouldn't call that concurrent, as the writers are fighting for the resource. And if there are enough writers, will they deadlock?Moreover, when the table becomes huge, with hundreds of terabytes, will a lambda and pyiceberg be able to vacuum and compact the table? If you compact the table every day, you now have a third writer you need to organize: The scheduled ingestion, the backfill and the compactor might all start committing at the same time.",

All in a tool that could be easily updated, distributed, and used by nontechnical stakeholders. This was my first analyst gig too, so don’t expect anything too cool—it was 100% locally ran Python that generated an Excel file daily.It was an Excel workbook with a summary sheet and another sheet for every country’s detail page. It used Excel formulas like HYPERLINK() to let users conveniently jump around the thing. Using Python allowed me to move a lot of the calculation backward into the Python step though, so I could basically bootstrap every cell with hardcoded values in its functions—no dynamic lookup stuff needed. It made the excel unmaintainable, sure, but it was quick as hell despite being big as hell. The python was maintainable, and I think that was the point. Excel was just the interface, getting generated every day from scratch.The Python script would connect to like 8 different APIs (a corporate db, several Google APIs, Reddit, Meta, and two porn networks) and generate a fresh report every morning. It was actually easier to regenerate the whole thing every day, than to try updating any single copy. The sources maintained their own history, and I just pulled it in every single day. Worked like a charm. I don’t work there anymore, but I often think about how I hope they’ve upgraded that thing by now (assuming it’s still around).",

You can do stuff like govern the definitions and that means everyone is consistently getting the same answers from the data because there is one metric or definition of a product. And most of all trying to build all that crap into a bunch of Excel sheets is tech debt hell. If you plan to have hundreds of reports based on your data, you want the data processing complexity to be minimal at that level to make them maintainable.Also I love Excel for the ability to do financial modeling or whatever and it does give you robust options, but Excel and VBA are crap as a reporting solution.",

I standardized the creation of our own primary key after matching facilities across all years, I joined dimensions details from other systems in an automated way so that the org hierarchy and address details stay updated. I created an intake form to force sanitized updates. Finally, I make him access the new cleaned dimension for his data needs (or I just do it for him).

Airflow is great for its strong community, extensive integrations, and mature scheduling features, making it reliable for complex workflows. However, it can be a bit clunky with dynamic DAG generation, and the setup might feel overkill for lighter tasks. Dagster shines with its focus on data assets and dependency management, which can be super handy with dynamic generation per user. Its built-in observability tools are really neat too, but some might find its approach a shift from traditional practices. Prefect offers dynamic task generation with a simple and Pythonic API, which can make it appealing for ease of use and quick iterations. It’s really intuitive for developers and scales well too.For integration with your sources, DreamFactory could simplify API generation for RESTful endpoints, while tools like Stitch or Fivetran might handle the replication aspects you need. Ultimately, pick the framework that aligns best with your team’s skill set and project growth trajectory.",

I've learned python along the way a few years back and started learning how to use API's and some of the major cloud tools here and there. Both at home and on the job, I had a few different titles between then and now and Data Engineer seems to have all but replaced ETL Developer in the job market from what I have seen. I was a bit uncertain when I first started applying for DE roles and most of them were no joke, job requirements I couldn't have handled 6 or 7 years ago. But learning as you go is a big part of what separates good engineers from mediocre ones. So, I say go for it.",

From my own experience with different forms of reqs gathering and documentation in both waterfall and Agile, the best artefact I’ve found so far for communicating the requirement is the data contract. It contains the relevant schemas, SLAs, who’s who, DQ rules, logic rules, etc in one consolidated form. Even better, it’s agreed by all parties that this is what the solution is. Unfortunately it still requires a lot of maturity to get right and people still try to shortcut it, but it’s definitely an improvement on DEs trying to piece together the holistic requirement from multiple docs.",

Redshift Spectrum has an atrocious load time where we observed 30+ second delays in queries that would cause issues with front ends requesting metrics. So now we've moved away from Spectrum in hopes to remove or lessen the load time. It was the path of least resistance, compared to switching to Athena. Some targeted common queries had comparable query times on average between Redshift (with redshift managed storage) and Athena. Switching to Athena would've been a bit more work to remap objects in ThoughtSpot. Our transformation pipeline running on Athena and DBT costs cents to run each time and the query speeds for that is not super important, at the moment. So its much cheaper for us to transform data there instead of Redshift.We've just barely done this switch from spectrum so we haven't gathered much data on actual speed improvements across the board but we should soon.",

In addition to that fun, the rules that constituted a \"good\" address changed from country to country. The acid test for the US was the addresses in Atlanta, GA. There are dozens of valid variations of Peachtree. Some countries, such as Switzerland, had the individual/company as part of a valid address. This didn't even begin to address misspellings and incorrect abbreviations.It is solvable and straightforward but not easy. You have to use different techniques for different problems in the data set. Sometimes a lookup against existing data is needed. Sometimes it is a correction table. In this case, it required brut force data cleansing using SQL (so I could treat things as sets and get some performance). I was able to run through the entire set in about 25 minutes. Once the bulk of the data was cleansed, I started using the Google mapping API on the front end to validate addresses. This started making the problem a bit better.",

If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.If you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.---Microbatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.For remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",

In general I agree with your sentiment. Streaming tool based pipelines tend to be more costly both to build and operate. A core problem is see with streaming tools is that, in order to be efficient, they implicitly impose constraints and often are intransparent. Both make it harder to build a reliable pipeline.

You made a great point about streaming tools becoming mere orchestrators for complex preprocessing — I’ve seen Kafka carry the whole workflow burden. Your comment about constraints and opacity is insightful. When teams don't need sub-second latency, the added cost and complexity of full streaming systems can be a burden rather than a benefit. Appreciate the insight — this definitely deserves a footnote in a future post!",

For now I just established a very basic try except block if something fails, if it fails it only records the parent device since there is a chance that the api returns nothing (no device information can be found), and I just log the parent row with little info.The end consumer would be a user to query the table directly. Trying to make it easier to mass query the two tables to answer simple questions like: how many of device A did we create, and what were the children/ attributes were related to it? How many times did child device B get created and with what parents?",

More or less all you have here should be two dimensions: Title (snowflaked with all the m:n categories and descriptors from the left side of the model), Person (possibly snowflaked with the primary profession), and what you call Appearance is a fact table which gives you facts that a certain person played a role in a certain title (possibly with degenerated additional dimensional info such as character name). Your proposed Title fact table contains fields which do not depend on time of observation (e.g. runtime - that should be a numeric attribute of the title dimension).Star should ideally model something different. Such as yields, countries and visitoris of different screenings of various titles. Or perhaps ratings of various episodes as they vary by time, country, demographic...",

Star schema is firstly denormalised so you have better performance of reporting even with the cost of a worse data model - so two dimensions on genre are not the way to go (there are applications for that, but not in this exact case) - EDIT - i see now, its m:n decomposition, but rest I stand with. Also the time dimension is kind of funny, if you try to filter the data on that, you will have a bad time.Start with something smaller - sales, product, customer, salesperson and time of sales, prepare some dummy data, download PowerBI desktop (its free, but you need a windows installed) and play with it for one evening, you will see, how you want to structure your data. Its hard, when you are starting, to change the thinking of relational database modelling to dimensional, but -Do a simple report with sum of sales by some dimension - customer, product... with a filter on date and you will see the idea and build on that. Always think, what you want to show, when building a star schema - and always shoot for a star, when you have a snowflake (dimension connected to another dimension), you need to reason yourself, if it's the correct approach.Try to have a discussion with some LLM (chat GPT...) it will guide you, but ask questions about why...And also, when in doubt, go to the elementary source: https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/Or, easier to consume:https://www.proserveit.com/blog/guide-to-dimensional-modelling",

If your descriptive concept has a 1:many relationship to a fact table (meaning only one description is related to a single record) then you directly join that dimension to the fact. Title would be an example of that as a movie only has one title. A many to many relationship would use a bridge table, in this case people. There are many actors in each movie. Generally you want to avoid many to many, but it's useful for some cases like that. I usually put a fact, or column to aggregate, in my factless fact tables as it's often easier to deal with in BI tools, but it's optional. You also want to consolidate your dimensions so that related information is not in a separate table. Title, title type and title season are all related, or do not differ across the rows of the fact. A movie will always have been produced in the same season, have the same category, director or whatever. If you wanted to represent movie revenue in your fact by region, then you would have a separate dimension for region as the same title would have several records in the fact with different regions and different revenue amounts. High level looking at this I think you have a fact table, date dimension, title dimension and actor dimension with a bridge. Might be a bit more complex if I thought through it, but looks pretty simple.",

That is not something I'd want in my organization. I typically have some Python scripts laying around that help me generate dbt docs. I'm thinking that a solution like that might help you with long-term consistency. Write a wee Python script that queries Snowflake to get a list of your production tables and fields with metadata. Then have it loop through the corresponding dbt doc .yml files in the repo and merge the tags into whatever else currently exists in the file for each field's meta tags.

It is HIGHLY unlikely that you will actually have weather information by route/problem. Weather predictions are usually given for the region and even if you could get it by problem/route it sounds unnecessarily complex to get data that is probably going to be wrong when you show up lol (weather is highly unpredictable at small scale is what I’m saying). I would find the mid-point for a given crag (or section if it’s really big or they are far apart etc) and just map that weather prediction by “area”. That will simplify things A LOT. Of course if you want to be more granular you can be, but remember software development is about digestible cycles of continuous improvement - start small and roll out more as you develop and understand what your end users actually want.If I completely missed the mark here or I can clarify things - let me know.",

SQL Server 2025 is currently in Private Preview.The two upcoming features I'm aware of that are most relevant are:1) Change Event StreamingI *believe* this will be in SQL 2025 as well from reading the year ahead post I link below, but I might be misreading it. Also not sure off the top of my head what additional destinations they may support now - original post only says \"CES on **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Event Hubs**, with plans to expand support for additional sources and destinations in the future\". There's a email address at the bottom of the post, or I can ask around :).[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/) 2) Fabric MirroringThis is a turn-key \"it just works\" native solution for SQL Server to Parquet in near-real-time - but it has one constraint that may be a non-starter for you - it can replicate to OneLake (which implements ADLS / Azure Blob Storage API), not S3. From there, you could use whatever ADLS-compatible tooling (including Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, et cetera) you like for further OLAP and reporting needs.Announced here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/)Should be quite similar to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database) but for SQL Server 2025.OneLake also supports \"Shortcuts\" to translate between Storage APIs and avoid you having to move all your existing data; but I'm a bit fuzzy off the top of my head whether writes **to** S3 are supported ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut) ) - OneLake is not my area of expertise, especially around the Shortcuts side of things. Dunno if you'll find either of those helpful - depends on if you are willing to upgrade to SQL Server 2025 and your exact requirements - but I thought I'd share in case you weren't aware.

        "body": "so first off, you're right, ADF is more batchy by nature. it doesn’t really do true real-time CDC, more like “check every X minutes”. same with a lot of ETL tools unless they explicitly support log-based CDC.now for the other tools:* **Airbyte**: decent UI, open source, but their SQL Server CDC connector is still maturing. under the hood, it’s not always real log-based CDC (might still hit the CDC tables afaik). worth testing but maybe not 100% what you’re after yet.* **Fivetran**: better polish, and they *do* support real CDC from SQL Server using log-based capture with HVR, but it’s expensive and can be a bit of a black box.* **Debezium**: yeah, powerful but totally get not wanting to run Kafka just for this. especially if the team isn’t familiar with the ecosystem if you're looking for something open source and lightweight-ish, you don't have a lot of options for SQL Server for real CDC.. If you're open to non-OSS solutions, Glue can work, but it's not very flexible.also curious: when you say DMS didn’t work well, was it reliability, speed, or something else? (just asking in case I run into a \\_lot\\_ of issues with DMS)if your team is okay with *some* managed stuff, and you still want log-based CDC that lands in S3 as parquet without having to orchestrate a bunch of infra, we at [Estuary](https://estuary.dev/) actually built a connector for exactly this SQL Server use case. happy to share more if you’re curious!",

You can also look at Rivery.io that has a very strong CDC engine as well. That said, why do you want to just dump into S3 and not use any of those tools to also load it for you into your DWH? If you use Rivery,  you can have Rivery dump the data into your S3 and also load it into your data warehouse in a single data pipeline",

        "body": "A few quick takes based on what you're describing: DMS – works in some scenarios but often struggles with data consistency and schema evolution, especially at scale. ADF – it's a batch-oriented tool. Good for scheduled pulls or full-table loads, but not built for log-based streaming CDC. Dev UX is also clunky. Fivetran / Airbyte – both batch ETL/ELT tools. Airbyte is not a scalable solution especially for high volume database; whereas Fivetran gets expensive real fast. Custom Python / AWS Glue – definitely an option, but as you mentioned, can become a huge maintenance burden. Hard to scale long-term. If your goal is to stream CDC changes directly to S3 in Parquet without managing Debezium and Kafka or relying on batch jobs, there are a few CDC tools built specifically for this. One example is my company [Artie](http://www.artie.com/), which focuses on log-based replication from transactional DBs like SQL Server into cloud storage with minimal setup. Hope this helps!",

Two out of three at once is fine for me.

These roles have a large impact on the well-being of team members and can carry a significant amount of stress. I find it very satifsying, but it shouldn't be the only way to progress.

        "body": "I’d think about this almost like validating a multi-step data pipeline. At each major stage, you can insert lightweight validation gates to catch issues early, before pushing into the next phase.You can use Soda Core for this (open source). It lets you define checks as YAML files and trigger them in Python or SQL-based workflows. Example: checks for model_inputs: - row_count > 10000 - missing_count(client_score) = 0 - min(transaction_amount) >= 0You can run these after data ingestion, data transformation, and post-modeling (e.g. “no negative predictions” or “R² above threshold”).If you’re curious, I just wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kmeqz2/lightweight_e2e_pipeline_data_validation_using/) about this type of lightweight validation using Python and YAML — not specific to ML models, but the idea applies.Happy to share how others have structured this if you want to go deeper.",

Ideally you can do it within your current role by putting your hand up to do those boring businessey meetings engineers hate, and get to talking at a strategic level to decision makers about what data engineering can do for them: so salesey, relationship management work.Another option to step out of tech but not starting over are things like scrum master, product owner, etc., where the work is mostly people but your grounding in the processes of delivering data and software will give you a head start.And also, consider whether it's the field you're in or just your job or company. In larger orgs you get pure data engineers who turn specs into code and bugs into fixes, but in smaller orgs data people tend to have to wear more hats so have more direct contact with the business instead of relying on BAs or similar to deliver specs to you.",

Something you're likely to discover when you go and do something else is how hard it can be outside of IT.If you can live without the money, then it's a no brainer - go and do something you love. Doesn't matter what it is.As other people have mentioned, moving into sideways moves where you're something like a Project Manager, working in sales or Business Development are all viable alternatives as there might be a pay cut but not massively.I worked in a field I hated for 10 years. I just didn't know I hated it. I always recommend for anybody who has worked in IT and gotten used to basically hating their job for money, go and do something you love. Just once to see what it's like. You never know and might find that not being miserable most days is more important than having a massive house or a yacht.",

That's what the \"git submodules\" thing makes me believe is going on.My advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects- projects can share Airflow-level utils- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime- external DAG dependencies- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together- less magicSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.From there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.External systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).Also, never ever use git submodules. You can either take my advice right here right now, or you can waste your time and learn the hard way.",

If we are going to do real time mirroring on a busy traffic, that’s just unrealistic for it to handle, you’ll have too many writes that can easily “trash” your storage and will reduce performance. If it’s something like hourly “sync” maybe it is fine. Again i am not against doing upsert, but more about :1. Managing performance expectations2. Understanding the actual cost of doing upsert, and working around this “cost”.A typical DWH will handle batch workload easily, and it’s easy to scale around this. It would be like 1000 small updates would be “more expensive” rather than one swoop of transformation that can give you equal final table.",

The benefit is that you have tons of flexibility in dynamically switching between environments, models, and other assets.Basically, you write models (queries) and then reference the model elsewhere. In my project, we built the star schema model in the models directory and the reference the models to create data marts.The hard part for many \"analysts\" is setting up the project, ci/CD and using docker for deployment.

One thing that’s worked is using a single Delta table with a version or snapshot column. You can tag each row with client and version info, so you don’t need to spin up new tables all the time. Then, just filter by those columns when users need to access a specific versionTable snapshots are basically just copies, so they’ll use about as much storage as making a new table. If you want to save space, sticking to a single table and partitioning or tagging by client/version is usually more efficient",

If you can nicely take your Jira and diagram out your backlog into a time series with swim lanes for each workstream it shows them that they can't have it all. Do the math for them in your deck in terms of FTE months and stuff.They might not act because of budget or whatever, but you can point to that same thing when they ask for 10 new projects and you barely have your head above water or they complain about general delivery time.When we did our modernization build I insisted on managed services where they made sense to avoid the pitfalls of self hosting open source or whatever because our company has been notoriously bad with giving headcount or paying market value. But it was easier to show that the managed service cost 1/4 or 1/2 of an FTE so that made sense. Managed services aren't the end all of course, but it was something our team couldn't handle at the time.",

SQL will help but data engineering can require experience across a broad scope of systems depending on the role and will require significantly deeper understanding of software engineering best practices. 4. The market (at least where I am) for data engineers is very up and down at the minute. On the whole the salaries are typically much better but the definition of data engineer varies quite a bit between businesses and a lot of business do not see a huge amount of value in data engineering as a practice. For now at least I think data engineering is in a decent spot but I can’t promise that will continue to be the case.",

If it’s analytics then I would try to stream/replicate the data into an intermediary format, (csv, parquet, dataframes, etc) you could custom code this or use ETL liked Estuary, dlt, airbyte etcIf you wanted to establish foreign keys constraints you’d have to remake those by hand.You can parallelize creating the tables but as far as I’m aware a bulk backup or something of the like straight into snowflake isn’t possible.3. It depends, if you’re a legitimate DE then it would be more technical unless you’re a pipeline monkey. You typically have to have advanced knowledge of SQL and some programming language. Tableau would not be a very convincing Transform skill as a DE like it would be for a DA. You’d be better off learning dbt, Python, or Spark.4. Yes, the avg pay ceiling for DE is much higher than a DA unless you’re one of those one man armies that has a strong understanding of the business side.",

Without passion it takes so much longer to stick because you'd rather be thinking about filing taxes or sitting at the DMV..Do some soul searching. College costs too much to get a degree in something you'll be forced to do the rest of your life and hate..",

My understanding is that Python is great for automation, data, databases, ML, and AI, but how creative can I get with Python when brainstorming project ideas? Am I confined to automation, databases, etc? Most of the things that come to mind when I think about building something are games and apps (maybe pen-testing tools). So what kind of cool/fun things can be built with Python? I’m leaning towards some fun chatbots, for now. But is that worth building for a beginners portfolio?",

This isn't at all a neutral choice. But you likely can't master 3-4 even as a senior. You just forget anyway. So pick maybe 1 main language and a second one. Pick popular one that may sense: Java, Python, javascript, C#.And each ecosystem is strong for some stuff and bad at others. C++ first strength isn't to code web applications for example. Java or python will not work that well for real time code. You don't write big industrial app in python...I don't think you need a portfolio and most of the time professional experience is valued much more than personal projects. Honestly even as beginner 1-2 internship are much more valuable than any portfolio. Once you have a bit of XP, the XP matters much more.You could almost always find solutions to most problem with the right Google search. Now it is just asking your preferred AI. Learn how to use these tools, really. Sure internal stuff you may have no choice, but in many case the info is just here.Many company will ask you to code something for interview and will ask technical/architectural questions. Train for interviews. Train for the coding exercise and train for architectural question as well as other interviews aspects.Once you are hire, you get a bit more time. But you need to get a foot at the door anyway. If you are not in, everything else is useless.",

You’re trying to train your brain to think in abstractions, understand decomposition, generalization, managing complexity, logic, and structure. That’s what CS is for. That’s what good teaching is for. And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.On the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first. Sometimes it does, with enough reflection. But often, it builds habits that are hard to unlearn later.If you want to learn programming, keep it small, controlled, and concept-driven. Then build up. Progression is the key.",

You do a lot of obligatory null checking or similar exception avoidance where you would need an if statement normally. And you need to do this a couple dozen times for different properties. Using a ternary lets you keep a block of all your property assignments that’s likely to fit on your screen and be easier to read and check off against a mapping spec. In normal coding, I prefer if statements. The style should make the pattern obvious while skimming a thousand lines of unfamiliar code base. My eyes are going to naturally see the loop and conditional blocks first and I may not read every assignment until I find the section I’m looking for. If a critical condition is camouflaged to look like part of an assignment block, that’s annoying.",

        "body": "When I'm using a language that does have a ternary operator and I have a bunch of short conditionals that do one simple thing in the body, then I prefer the ternary. It keeps the entire thing on one line just so that things don't look as messy and cluttered, and the presence of the operator itself tells you that we have a 1-liner going on here.In other languages that don't have them, I still tend to prefer the 1-liner for the same reasons, but I also just feel weird about it because it's not as immediately apparently what's going on. I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with. In C/C++ // no ternary if (X > Y) { return X; } else { return Y; } // ternary return (X > Y) ? X : Y;In FPC // no \"ternary\" if X > Y then begin exit(X); end else begin exit(Y); end; // \"ternary\" if X > Y then exit(X) else exit(Y);For me, the ternary operator just makes it easier to parse because I know that its function is pretty much to facilitate the cleaner 1-liner. In FPC and other language that don't have one, it's only very slightly more effort to figure out what's going on, but it still kinda rubs me the wrong way and I might want to just use the whole if..else block to make the intention more clear.All that being said, it's basically all inconsequential and up to personal preference. I can't see getting upset over seeing multiple blocks of conditionals vs. multiple 1-liners.",

I use it to augment my auto complete and boilerplate stuff like unit tests but asking it to do much more than that is dubious at best and I usually regret it when I try because I end up just spending as much time refactoring it as I would just writing it correctly in the first place.I don't think we're going to see massive breakthroughs in coding LLMs and we're already getting diminishing returns. The limitation being that by design it's going to produce the most average code it's trained on and it's started to get trained on it's own buggy code.I maintain that in 5-10 years there will be a huge demand for senior engineers that understand coding because there will be a generation of vibe coders that don't know how to fix all the technical debt they created.

That led to reading about what vectorization is and how to utilize it effectively, it wasn't even a tool in my toolbox until then but now that will stick with me. Learned about SIMD (same instruction multiple data) and how python as an interpreted language works with compilation to byte-code and finally being ran by the cpython virtual machine, as well as how using numpy and vectorization drastically reduced the compilation step as numpy uses precompiled C/Fortran subroutines.

The destination is a very differently formatted excel file with additional fields for patient info which I was supposed to look up in the hospital’s IT system and manually enter. The rest of the data fortunately didn’t have to be edited. I realised that the destination file already has all the patient info in the previous entries (and in fact others were just searching and copying it from the same file) so I did some excel ju-jitsu and made a “program” sheet which would auto-format (28 hidden columns) and automatically fill in patient info any num of rows you copy-pasted directly from the source file. Even with copying patient data from the previous entries, logging 100 calls (2 days worth) usually took about 3-4 hours of mind numbing work, I got that down to about 15 minutes. Being from a non-tech background, I felt like a wizard.

To completely hand over software development to AI means you are just automating automation, which gives you less control and specificity.That said, for writing difficult algorithms or complex systems, AI may be used for most of that work in the future, the same way that chess engines can outplay humans.The problem with AI coding right now is that it is simply based on large language models, not a formal system such as coding verification. for example, you can task large language models to play chess, but they constantly suggest illegal moves and while they can make some very clever moves, they also make incredibly stupid ones at times as well.AI coding will take off once the machine learning systems are based on rigorous formal descriptions of programming languages, not just general large language models.Right now I would argue the best uses of AI for coding is translating large code bases from one language to another, prototyping of very simple ideas, or embedding an AI system to allow users to prompt the text.The problem is LLMs are very easy to apply to a wide variety of tasks, but LLMs aren't specifically tailored for programming, so just like LLMs are much worse than a chess engine, specifically designed for chess, there will likely be innovations for ai programming that aren't just \"feed this LLM a bunch of code and see what it can do.\"LLMs will continue to get better, but even before LLMs people created logical proof systems and formal verification tools that are much more specific to programming.I imagine a scenario where you just write the test cases and then the ai system generates the code and algorithms that can pass those test cases.",

I deemed acceptable if I ended above 90%, with the last 10% me having understood the concept but maybe lacking excellent execution). > without getting overwhelmed? You will get overwhelmed. It's normal. Learn to deal with that.

Yes, I'm not fully self-taught, people may dismiss my experience as \"basically not self-taught\" if they want, but at least I'm transparent.

You need to learn by doing projects because projects by definition have an end. Tutorial Hell is like open world games, you can just keep going. 1. What I did was to set myself projects which interested me that we adjacent to the kind of tasks I'd be doing in a job. In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases. Rabbit-holes are great and you should dive into them, but having a project tethers you to what you're trying to achieve and you can drag yourself back because you start to feel guilty that you've not made progress. If your goal is undefined \"I'm going to learn\" that mindset will encourage you to keep going deeper. For example, in my case I spent time working out how to get data into pandas, but I also went down some rabbit-holes of anonymous functions and different file formats which were good to know, but not directly applicable. I didn't get into what's possible to do in numpy because my motivation was to get my project done, not to learn learn learn. 1. Same answer as the other two. \"Do projects.\" 99.9% of programming is going to fall outside of your project's scope, so it naturally limits you to a domain that should be manageable. If it doesn't, then the programming mindset of continually breaking down the problem until you have something you can solve or you can research how to solve it will get you the rest of the way.",

For me, I only hit my stride once I started getting into data related stuff(machine learning, analytics, etc.) and suddenly it clicked and I was having a blast trying to figure out how the hell to do certain things. Here's a tip that helps active learning at the beginning - a lot of lessons will have exercises based on what you just learned e.g. \"here's how a loop works, now do XYZ with it\". Come up with a similar type of problem, and try to figure that out. If you're not sure where to find coding exercises, ChatGPT is a good source. Don't use it to cheat or \"vibe code\" because you won't learn that way. But you can take a topic, whatever you're learning at the moment(road maps are good for this) and ask it to give you an explanation of how the topic works(like loops as mentioned above, or dictionaries, or whatever) and then ask it to give you some problems to work on. When it comes to coding, doing it really is the key to learning. The more I struggle the more I learn, personally. My first job after graduation for example was as an electrical technician. I learned the very basics of PLC coding in my class but when it came to actually troubleshooting big assembly lines with those programs I really got thrown in the deep end and got exponentially better because of how tough it was at first.",

It could only be FreeRTOS like.And to be fair, it's a horrible idea to do this. ESP32 is built on FreeRTOS. Most of the SDKs rely on FreeRTOS. And since BT and WiFi are undocumented binary blobs, you would have to reverse engineer it fully to get support (as a beginner, you wont be able to do this. Even as a professional its question of months). Other than that, I think everything else is fairly okay at documentation. Im sorry, but it seems that your professor has no clue what he is talking about.You might be luckier with STMs (especially the H7 dual cortex ones). But why go down embedded OS way? If something go for plain old x64 or even RPi. This assignment doesn't make sense.If you want to get into embedded, just use STMs or ESPs without that fancy shit. Its hard enough by itself. If you are interested in higher lever low level (like userspace Assembly or OSDev) then just go with your regular x64. Both Linux and Windows works. If you have no clue what you are doing, Windows might be harder for beginners.Edit: the H7 actually doesnt have a dual cortex dev board that's below 300 dollars iirc. Its a shame. Lower end H7s do. I would really appreciate if someone would make one for the higher end H7s that does not have all the fancy things EVAL has.",

However, getting anything done with it will be tedious, because it's a low-level language. If you combine it with something like Lua or Python this can be OK.On the other hand, Rust has a punishing early learning curve, but it's worth it. It's a lot more powerful than C. It can prevent a class of memory errors that plague C/C++ programs. The discipline the compiler forces you into helps you write code at larger scales. You'll still be able to master it faster than C++, which is an atrociously overcomplicated language that I cannot recommend over Rust or C.",

Why is JavaScript good for web development? Is it especially suited for manipulating HTML? No, but it is the only languages (let's ignore wasm for now) that is available in the browser so you have to use it...Why use C# for game development and not Java? Because someone made the application Unity and chose C# as the language to use and Unity was a bloody great application. Yes, C# has stuff that makes it useful for developing games, but it could have been Java.Python is an easy language to pick up and that has of course played a role in it's popularity for AI, but today, since it has become a very common language for AI, all the new libraries need to support Python as well, making it less and less likely that any \"more suitable\" language can take its place.",

        "body": "First JavaScript and web development is because JavaScript is the only language that runs in the web browser. If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?I suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in. Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process. You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.I would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development. Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues. You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down. The Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure. I suspect Windows is all C. These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead. There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself. This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.C# and games I have no comments on. My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs \"fast enough\" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",

You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it). You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading. Not a big deal you say? Consider some linear algebra: AX=B. In C++, that could look like B = A\\*X; In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X)); Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain. There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int. Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting. C# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large. Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS). Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away. Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry. Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). So to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else. New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before. Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so. In the 80s and 90s, most people were happy if they could use a word processor without too much work.",

You don't need a class just to do what a simple function can do.- Overcomplicating things where it doesn't need to be. You don't always need interfaces for everything, not everything needs to be as abstracted as possible, just keep things as simple as they need to be.Edit to add: be skeptical of dogma. It's common in programming because the field attracts a lot of egotistical know-it-alls, and YouTube videos amplify this because it gets clicked. To ensure I'm not being hypocritical, please also treat this comment with some skepticism.",

A lot of their confidence comes from their own intelligence. They are in an industry that validates that intelligence, and celebrates sharing that intelligence. This can lead to many thinking that if they’re really smart, and their way of thinking is really efficient, and it works, and they can see how other people agree that it works, then therefore it must be the ONLY or at least the BEST way. And that’s where they lose me.

Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.Can you find a connection between these two points?Could it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?Meanwhile the \"seniors\" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.So why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the \"is-a\" vs \"has-a\" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human` - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy` - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone` - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`These are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well. Android very much *is-a* operating system, and Firefox very much *is-a* browser.",

It is important thoughBUT:Thing is, when you write something you know how it works, but you also know how all the things it is built on work.What is self evident to you may not be to someone else. And even if you know it might not be, it is not always even a part of your project, is it your responsibility to document that? How do you draw that line? If you make a javascript framework, do you need to teach them how to write a function in javascript?I guarantee your docs are less clear than you think they are.Docs are hard.I have a nix project. My docs cover a ton of stuff not part of the project, just basic nix useage stuff. I still get people asking how to do basic nix things with it, saying the docs don't cover X or Y thing that is definitely not my responsibility to cover. Often times, I did actually still cover it somewhere. Things as simple as, how do I add my flake as a flake input. Which to me, seems like something you should definitely already know if you are using nix at all? But I demonstrate it anyway? And people still ask? Im hoping reformatting them at some point will help with that, but at a certain point only so much can be done.",

        "body": "The real issue here is that the data modeling is poorly defined.Normalizing the LineItem table just to avoid redundancy thinking \"I already have the product data, no need to store it again\" completely misses the point. The LineItem table doesn’t describe the product itself. It represents an economic transaction, and the price it refers to is not the current catalog price, but rather the price snapshot at the time of the sale, specifically referred to that order.In fact, this is exactly where discounts, custom prices, or promotions could apply. Directly in the LineItem. Tying it only to the current Product data breaks the integrity of historical records and assumes that product attributes are timeless, which they clearly aren't.Edit i see many answers with triggers, other tables and so on. If you move redundancy out of a table that should be ,because of semantic, \"denormalized by design\" you are not removing redundancy from DB and you have an inconsistent LineItem table as result.Normalization should not be \"never replicate data, even when it has different meaning\".Normalization is a technical tool that originated because, before ORMs, data persistence was handled directly by application code, which led to all sorts of issues. The idea was to solve these problems by abstracting the physical layer of persistence and using relational algebra rules to optimize the logical design.But normalization must be subordinate to proper modeling of entities and meanings.For example, suppose you have a product_quantity field in a product catalog table, meaning \"units per package\", and another product_quantity field in a warehouse table, meaning \"units in stock\".Should you normalize the schema to avoid redundancy, or disambiguate the semantics first?The answer is obvious: semantics first. Otherwise you're just normalizing confusion.",

At 27, I decide to go full into IT, I plan to go into Data Analysis role. I join intense course for PCEP (Python cert), but couldn't land DA role. I just took a graduate assistantship at university helping lecturers to do Data processing for ML research. During the assistantship,, I attended part time webdev bootcamp, not actually interested in webdev, I just wnat to network with IT people so I can land proper IT job. After my assistantship contract ended, I joined UX reskill bootcamp under government program that helps retrennched workers. I managed to get myfirst dev role due to their on the Job training program. The company I'm training at didnt proceed to hire me, but I managed to land a laravel role at other company. This is my current role I have just started in 5 months. You definitely can go into tech, but it's going to be really fucking hard, and understand that your arsenal aren't as good as other candidates because we come from different academic discipline. Getting through HR is the toughest, I advise you to get some certs just so it can convince them. I'd prefer to go for known certs like COMPTIA, cisco, Python Institute because HR might recognise these names, compared to udemy and LinkedIn learning. Definitely make a good project you can be proud of. It's easier to show the technical managers what you have built than just yapping about it. In my experience, everyone in the webdev bootcamp I have attended, knows that personal projects are crucial to land a job, but most end up not building anything either way.Also, I think Python is agood starting point, but if I were you, I'd pick a niche on top of python. For example build an API server using python, or build an automation script using python. That way, if you got offer for role that's not related to python, you can still explain the technology and mechanisms, even though they are using different programming language. I know I'm still very junior, but I'm sharing this to paint the picture of the path you may experience as a career shifter. It may be easier for you, or it may be harder. Good luck!",

As a beginner programmer, you probably don't care about any of that unless your explicit goal is to use the language as a means to learn about what's going on at the hardware level. It sounds like you just want to build something cool. Languages like C# or python or javascript are much better suited to that purpose. Moreover, there is really no rule that you need to \"stick to a language\". Sure, if you're a professional with 10 YoE it makes sense to stick to your area of expertise, but besides that, you should feel free to oscillate between lots of languages whenever you want. Even single projects can combine multiple languages. You should think first about what you want to learn or build, and then work from there to what's a good language for that.

Then imagine how it is played in real life, you have a deck made of cards, you have a dealer, you have one or more players, players ask for cards (or the dealer draws cards), they bet, and the one closer to 21 points wins. Write down in text the interactions, like \"the dealer shuffles two, three, four decks of cards\", \"the dealer deals one card to every player\", \"the players bet\", etc, etc, and then find the nouns and the verbs. Nouns are potential classes (player, dealer, card, deck, bet, etc) whereas verbs are potential methods (deal, bet, withdraw, etc). Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the \"protocol\" between them, which \"messages\" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which \"messages\" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.Maybe you should begin with simpler designs?

And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.Don't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods. They're mainly helpful when you code yourself into a corner and don't want to redo large bits, so don't use them in the beginning.Don't try to organize your code according to the typical OOP tutorials. It never works. Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.If you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.Use OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.Try to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your \"nouns\" and \"verbs\", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.Be perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.\"The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle\" - someone else's quote.OOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.Consider this: goto and global variables exist too.Write a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

For example, you should be able to layout your blackjack OOD on a single sheet of paper. I would get a single sheet of paper and try to identify all the class involved (i.e. Card, Deck, Player, Dealer, Hand, etc). Then identify the relationships between those objects (i.e. Deck has 52 cards, Player/Delear has a Hand, Hand is a collection of Cards etc). The identify some of the action that can be done against those objects (i.e. Deck shuffles, Deck deals a Card, Player/Dealer Stands or Plays, the Hand requests a Card, Hand goes bust, Hand has a Total).Once you have the OOD uses that design to play out imaginary games on paper and refine the design until it works as expected. Then take that OOD and convert it into code which is the OOP part.",

See #2.2) you have invented a 'book cipher' where the 'book' is the 'values of pi' * one problem is that there is only one possible key(book), so anyone who knows, can read them all/forge messages. * another problem is that the letter 'e' will always turn into 852-3 -- in other words, you will have detectable patterns.",

They used this crazy nested loops and nested if else constructs and an array. It did not implement the desired logic precisely so it kept running into cases it didn't acct for. Anyway i rewrote that whole thing and used a map map set. Now for a tiny bit of extra memory we don't have to worry about missing cases cause the desired logic is exact for each scenario without having to handle individual scenarios. It also runs twice as fast but this was not really a concern. The logic being proper according to specs is the real change. I should never see this issue again. New cases should have no impact now and be processed precisely. Another item was a batch job that have 15 if else blocks to run the same logic on 15 different string builders. Rewrote that to reuse 1 string builder and remove all the if else blocks using a bucketing approach and while loop. Now the records can expand as much as needed without issue. Used to be every time data grew someone would add another if else.",

I suggested printing to pdf and sending the pdfs to whoever needs them, but I was told by management that \"auditors will never accept pdf statements, they're too easily faked\". For context, these account statements were incredibly simple in formatting, no watermarks or anything like that... you could fake one in under 10 minutes with Word. I do wonder how those managers are coping in 2025... They'll all be retired by now but I suspect things like contactless payment and online banking are utterly horrifying for them.",

And I jump in to force the task to end (so I take controls and show them how we finish this). But at this point, I can't take the time to let them in control and me helping them \"getting it\". What I should be doing if they accepted my help before. My role, at least a big part of it.At some point they were frustrated because our pairing session was just me showing off...So I stated as an objective that they have to talk to me often about what is blocking them. They also have to accept help when I offer it. They choose when, but they have to accept or else, I'll be taking the task if they can't handle it and everyone is frustrated. And they shoot themselves in the foot. So my main idea is:It's cool to want to get things on your own. But you are given help to be able to do more than that. So please use that. Use your mates whatever the level, raise warning about your blockers, communicate.You can get things on your own, on your own time... That's a bit harsh, but the project needs to move forward. Else, you'll be ejected from the project.It's more important to raise warning, that's team play. You're not alone in this, you shouldn't at least (I may have missed something in your post).Edit: to answer the part where the team doesn't answer fast enough. Tell your manager and insist.

Ask for help earlier and raise warnings faster (like, metacognitively, learn to recognize when you're being a perfectionist stubborn person; learn those patterns in your own process and learn to recognize when it's happening). What you're describing is a great way to develop mastery and delve deeply into topics and subjects that interest you. But it's also not right to do that at the expense of your coworkers' sanity and time and the money of your employers. Does that make sense? Do side projects, keep that perfectionist-mastery side of you alive through those. But sometimes at work you just need to do the things and the stuff and that's ok too.

There are several alleys towards unblocking and you must timebox your attempts, not fall for sunk cost fallacy, reassess the problem, rubber duck yours, others and even 3rd party code, ask for help, ask for clarifications, break down the problem into known facts, stash/shelve your changes and start over, or my favorite: do something else and come back to the problem later.Remember: the only thing that can solve a problem is a solution to it, and debugging for months isn't a solution, it may help identify the problem but that depends how you go about it. You are also not responsible for all the overlying causes to blockers, so if it tends to happen over and over in the same code base maybe it's the code base and not you (as a senior dev I've found that the faster I assess that the code base stinks, the faster I deal with blockers).There are resources online that tackle this very part of software development and with science and practice you'll unblock yourself much faster and you won't feel blocked that many times.",

I had issues with fine motor control, basically it hurts to write. The biggest issues with this is that my penmanship sucks, and I trained myself to get to the point quickly. I would write just enough to get the point across. This didn't help my English grade when I need to write a three page paper. So I had to constantly go back and be more descriptive. My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.2. My short term memory was found to be lacking. This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation. Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember. Looking back on school, I did well in Math and Science where I would understand the concepts and apply them. I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.I am now the lead programming architect at my company. If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me. If people don't know how to write something, they come to me. If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.When programming people start off learning the language, which is needed. The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs. I \"know\" many many languages, I will learn a new one for fun to see if I like it better than whatever is currently my favorite, but if I don't program in a language for a month, I have to use google to refresh my memory.Truthfully, anyone can learn a programming language, but to really program you need to be able to think logically, you need to be able to break big problems down into smaller tasks, then break those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks. You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language. The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that. Again the only way to get good at that, is to program.",

Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.Once you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.I will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.You’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it. This is actually one of the key tenets of object oriented design, often called “abstraction”. The better you learn to follow these design principles the easier of a time you will have coding bigger and bigger projects.",

This framework is often used for teaching and, while not always perfect, can give you an idea on how to structure your learning efforts.1. Before we create, we must be able to evaluate.2. Before we evaluate, we must be able to analyze.3. Before we analyze, we must be able to apply knowledge/skills.4. Before we apply, we must understand what we do and why we do it.5. Before understanding, we must be able to recall accurately.Things slipping through your mind is a signal that the foundations aren’t strong enough, and frankly this is an iterating process of discovery whenever you try new things.Be patient and start slow.Start by mirroring the stupid simple stuff until you are able to recall facts and the basics.Then practice explaining the ideas or concepts behind what you are doing. Also, predict and test experiments to facilitate assimilation; e.g. what would happen if I DO or DONT DO something? What if it’s slightly different?Progress into applying your knowledge into solving simple and complex problems. A simple problem is one where you directly apply some knowledge. A complex one is where you first need to decompose into smaller problems, then build up to the bigger more general solution.When you are comfortable with those, the next cognitive level is analysis. Draw connections among ideas, compare them against others.After that you’ll be able to confidently evaluate options and alternatives and justify your decisions (and if proven wrong, then you’re still learning more).Finally, after all that, you’ll become able to synthesize all that knowledge and skills with fluency so that most of your efforts are focused on designing and creating solutions.Practicing the basics, over and over, will naturally put you in a position to apply what you learned and eventually reach mastery.This framework can help you charter your learning journey—yet the key remains being patient and consistent.",

You can't whittle it down yet; it will whittle itself down as you get more experienced. Start anyway. Be prepared to forget a lot the first few times you do it: memory builds up gradually and incrementally, not all at once.Sooner or later, you'll have used for loops (or whatever) so much that you can throw away your old notes on them entirely, or refine those notes into just the tricky little corners you keep getting stuck on or some cool new feature you heard about recently. That's okay. Your notes can evolve with you.Try working through a tutorial on whatever language you're learning, and every week or three, pause to design yourself a \"cheat sheet\" of what you've learnt so far. (Look up other cheat sheets on Google Images for inspiration of how to lay them out. Try to make it maximally useful for **you**, not just to cram it full of as much information as you can get on the page. Don't be afraid to go through lots of rough drafts and lots of scrap paper.

Overall, what you're describing, I have to agree with the other commenters that you want to look for a different job. If you are optimistic for some reason, you can try to make a change and bring it up to leadership and maybe this is your opportunity. Good luck.",

You might not always be on the innovation side of work, it might be a lot of support and maintenance. My advice to you is, how bad do you need this job? How much experience do/did you actually get? Think about this before jumping ships, you likely don't have the experience to be successful else where too etc.Think of it this way, 2-3 years might not be a lot of experience if you're on a legacy project. You're doing a lot of maintenance etc. so then your next job might want someone with tons of greenfield project experience. It'll be hard to get hired.And finally, the hard lessons we all eventually learn ... You're hired on to solve business needs. Do you understand the business?Because let me tell you something, you may want growth but the company needs maintenance/support. What do we call this? Your goals may not align with business goals, therefore you're not delivering value if you want growth.Hope this shed some light on the insights. In short, what the company needs may not be what you want.",

Once you find something promising, leave. Consulting shops where you work for external clients are probably the best for growth.But yeah, as always you'll just have to try and communicate, to make the best of it.You don't feel like the meeting is worth it? Ask your manager if you need to be in it, and why you need to be in it. Bring your laptop to the meeting and clean up a PR if the meeting gets boring.Feeling overwhelmed? Ask your manager what task is most important and tell them you'll be focusing on that for the next few days and drop everything else. Are people constantly showing up at your desk, needing things? Tell them politely to send you or your manager an email, and you'll look at it later. Make your manager feel the pressure you are feeling, and force them into their management role.Lack of mentorship when you don't really know what you're doing? Been there, it sucks. I've spitballed many ideas off of people in coding chatrooms, that helped. Perhaps there is a guy at the office who loves to yap about programming, ask them. If you're being asked for a time estimate on when a feature is done, plan in a lot of extra time so you have time to research and try different things. (People don't care if a task takes one day or three as long as your estimate is correct.) If the seniors ask you why feature X would take this long tell them you've never done X and you'll need to research but it would be cool if they helped.",

Ask to be put on only 2 projects instead of 3. As a junior you work will always be grunt work but it doesn't have to be meaningless. Suggest changes and then possibly make a POC with some of your free time. Be proactive, that is one way to get noticed and put on more interesting projects.

So if you like them, you don’t know enough Vim, and you should go learn the other 90%.

(Yes, that's technically possible with the other IDEs, but they are not built for that and you can tell. Even if you have hotkeys for everything, switching focus to another panel can be a pain in the ass alone, when compared to neovim) Not just the code editing, but the file searching, project managing, git controls, probably even database access. I am pretty good with my IDE, but I must admit, switching to a different part of the project is more clunky than it would be in neovim with a correct setup)4) It's just fun to configure.

I am unfamiliar with the word \"placement\", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.I think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the \"barista\" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.Then, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. I'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly. But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.Sorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask \"If I do X, will Y happen\", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.To delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.The first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.The other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.Just because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. Then, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well. I've been using Claude to help organize some of my personal projects and it does a pretty good job.",

The languages are just a neat abstraction to enable you to do complex data manipulation and DSA is the most efficient ways we know on how to store and process said data by efficiently using the underlying hardware. That said to find a placement you’d ideally want to know ahead of time as to which industry you are interested in as all of them try to solve different issues and have different tooling to do so. I would also like to add that code is just a tool and your job primarily isn’t to write code but to be able to digest business requirements/problems and then turn them into solutions using software and hardware which makes knowing and understanding your industry of choice paramount.For broad understanding I would highly recommend grounding your knowledge in lower level language like C/C++ (great for understanding the foundations of software) and a higher level language like python(useful for speed of delivery) as with this base you would be able to quickly and easily pick up any other language as needed.All languages also have their own specific abstractions to make a specific problem easier like frameworks and libraries which is in itself is a rabbit hole, some devs only specialise in these for example, react, Django, Spring Boot, .Net core and so on.Here’s what stacks you’ll most likely find on the market:Web dev Corporate = C#/Java, will stay like this for a long time due to how deeply embedded these ecosystems are in big corporations.Web dev Startup = python/node.js, free and stable with immense community support great for quick development cycles and MVP buildsSystems = C/C++ as most of the time you’d be working closer to hardware or require a lot of performanceDevOps = shell and scripting, python YAMLData = python/R and SQL",

To be comfortable in that language, start using it to solve DSA questions.Also, be comfortable in one OOP language and another multi-paradigm language. So for your case, C++ and Python will do.For DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.It's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material. Or if nothing works, then it just means you don't like web dev.In regards to the question in the post, if you can solve DSA questions, then you are halfway there. So many ask DSA questions in the interviews. So def get good at that. You should also get comfortable with OOP/OOD/design principles/SOLID patterns and other basic patterns. And work on some project that you are interested in. Use Git/GitHub to manage your project. Also, work on your behavioural interviews, use the STAR method: [https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR\\_Method\\_Interviews.pdf](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)",

But I officially learned Python in my Uni class. Same with DSAs, learned the foundation in a Uni class and have other Uni resources to learn DSAs. For this reason, I don't have any recommendations for online resources.I am also at a point now where I am comfortable enough to not do complete courses on a language to learn how something works. This is because programming concepts and syntax vary slightly from language to language. And so docs and small YT videos/crash courses are enough for me. But it may not be enough for you.For DSAs, you could also refer to this: [https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms) and use online resources and even AI to help you understand how an algorithm works.Also, use a platform like Leetcode to learn DSAs.When you are solving a problem, think how you would solve it, if you are struggling to think of a solution, go and read the solution. If the solution isn't accessible to you, find another resource like a YT video that will show you how the problem can be solved. After having understood the solution, solve it on your own. Then move to the next problem. And rinse and repeat. With time, you will get better at identifying how to solve a problem using a specific algorithm/idea/data structure.As a start, attempt one Leetcode/Hackerrank/whatever platform question a day. It's ok if you didn't solve it, point is that by the end of the day you learned something new, like a new algorithm or a new data structure or a new idea. Take notes on a Google Doc for instance to make sure you understand how it works.",

It snowballed from there with more and more features.Took me 5 minutes to make the dependency injector, but several days before I was able to actually test it.Once that was done, I wanted to play with alpinejs in latte templating to see what kind of reactive monstrosity I could cook up. I already had the haphazard framework from the DI stuff, so I repurposed it, which led to making the form building part of the framework to test the capabilities of that.I've gone too far down the rabbit hole at this point so I just keep adding junk to it when I want to test something.

Instead, I engineered a solution that required typing a string key only once in the base English language file. For example, something like: `{\"module_one.object_one.bananas\": \"This is a Banana\"}` To automate the process, I then had a Groovy script dynamically generate enums from a template and create an entry for each translation key. E.g.: ```public enum ModuleOneKeys { // ... OBJECT_ONE_BANANAS // ...}```This allowed my IDE to have a solid reference to all language keys, so, in theory, I could never type a key that didn't exist.That alone might not be super overengineered, but the entire language framework built from scratch around it was -- considering it had to handle mutability, plurals, colors, formatting, and the logic to send it over the network to multiple nodes and clients. All for mere translation support.",

Then if that wasn’t enough, it also makes sure the locations are available to begin with, and if they aren’t, it can failover to performing the backup to a second location.And because the first version was written so haphazardly, I just had to refactor it and rewrite it a second time to clean it up.",

Yes, they can't handle load, but you'll only have one client.) You'd use the localhost loopback to put the client and server on the same device. If it's OK to do everything in-browser, you could write everything in Brython and use standard HTML forms and JavaScript APIs. Making the client and server communicate is not that much harder. You'd do custom handlers. GUIs usually have at least two threads anyway, so you'll have to do something like this regardless. It might be slightly easier to install Bottle at that point, but the standard library can do it.There's Gooey which automatically converts command-line applications into GUIs. It's pretty easy to use. That still has to be the workflow you want though.Since you're doing you a budget tracker, you could customize [PySpread](https://pyspread.gitlab.io/).

Don't worry about 'memorising', worry about the fundamental concepts. Set yourself a little challenge and walk through every tiny minor detail of it. Write it out. What helped me being a non math person as well, was going back and doing some Khan academy (all the high school level math). Really helped fill a lot of basic gaps and put me in the right mindset for problem solving. Might be worth it for you too.",

After having been through for-loop exercises, invent your own, decide that you want a loop that goes backwards, or skips every third number, or doubles every time. Small things. Then decide if you have some simple project-ideas you can build with what you have learnt - ask your self if something interesting can be made with if-statements and loops!So it isn't either or, but also do a project!",

People fall into the trap of watching videos or reading books and literally just don’t do the thing they’re studying.When you’re first starting out, don’t copy paste code. You won’t learn anything from copypasta code. Failing is part of learning. If you’re not failing in programming you’re an absolute genius with zero flaws, which nobody is.Programming is 10% coding and 90% debugging said code.

It is essential that you talk through your problem-solving steps, be very verbal, and don't stop talking while you are working. It is OK to start with a simple brute-force or partial solution, and then iterate to improve it. * Expect a mix of technical and behavioral questions. For example, 'talk about a time when you found yourself running out of time to complete a project'. Each behavior question should be treated as an opportunity to send a signal about yourself - You are smart, work well with others, take ownership, think deeply when solving problems, etc. Review the Amazon Leadership principles (there are 14 of them), and try to include at least one in every single behavior answer. * Technical interviews are a learned skill.

It also opened up embedded systems more which goes along with the robotics, which now in my final year of college ive been making an autonomous drone for detecting and spraying pesticides on different types of plants.Of course you can do this in python as well, but C and C++ add some layers of challenge and fun because you can actually do everything by register level programming which gets fun and writing drivers.Anyways, not to say my path is the one you should follow but I think really sinking your teeth into one or two fields will give you a different perspective and don’t hold back, go full throttle into it. Focus on the concepts rather than the code too!",

Change things in the code, make it fail on purpose, trying to predict how it will fail, make it work again, create more files, move the files, delete the files, create them somewhere that's not the cwd, create them both in absolute path and relative...And after that, make three mini-projects about the new things you learned. It's not important to make too much sense with the mini projects, as loNg as they are relatively quick and make iou exercise that new knowledge.I've been doing it this way and... well, while I'm not 'there' yet, I am improving.",

A full-stack developer is expected to be able to build an entire modern application from the ground up on their own, more or less. I'm not sure if it's really a choice you should be making as a freshman? Like, as a student you should be learning a little bit about all of these things ANYWAYS and you should be constructing small projects from the ground up to get your feet under you, but I think that level of specialization (or, in the case of a full-stack developer, that profound committment to not specializing) is something you don't really settle in to until you're a bit more experienced?",

They are more likely to cover specific technologies (say, Spring, or some web framework).In any case, \"good choice\" is subjective. It's certainly popular. You're not going to get one answer, so you'll have to decide among many answers. For example, someone could say there's a lack of young Cobol programmers and despite fewer jobs being in Cobol, they exist, and are mostly by older programmers that may retire soon.Is that a good choice? Most would say no, but maybe? There's less competition, but that could mean fewer opportunities as well.Given its popularity, it's probably not a bad choice, provided you're willing to do other things.Other choices, which may or may not be available to you are data science, machine learning, but they do require more math (e.g., statistics).",

        "body": "There's so many use cases for each of those languages. It really depends what your end goal is.Python is good for if you want a career in data science, algorithms, machine learning, and some pretty high level stuff.Java is good for software engineering or architect, QA (Quality Assurance), web development, etc.C, I'm not entirely sure because I've never even touched it yet.C++ is good for high performance systems and applications and embedded systems like medical services and equipment as well as any day to day stuff you use like your smartwatch, your car's tablet thingy idk what it's called, and much more.It's also an excellent choice for if you want to go the game dev route and learn Unreal Engine.In the end, it really comes down to your end goals. While the most programming languages can do the same things as another language can, one is usually better and more efficient at doing so. What do you want to do or be when it comes learning programming? And do you want this to be a real career? If that's the case, then you really need to consider your goals. Hope this answer at least helps and I'm open to being corrected on some stuff I just said. Best of luck, mate.",

But my life took a strange turn towards the end of my degree when I got offered a job as a software consultant. While it didn't involve any programming, I figured it would be a good first job to get me started in the industry and heading in the right direction.I ended up spending close to a decade working as a business analyst before I finally had enough. I hated every day at work and regretted not following the passion for programming that I had since I was a teenager.Long story short, I quit my job and brushed up on my programming skills to the point where I eventually got a job as a junior software developer. I had to restart my career from scratch and take a significant salary drop but I was finally doing something I actually loved.Fast forward to today and that was the best career move I could have ever possibly made. I wasn't as old as you at the time, but I was certainly older than most and had to literally start climbing the career ladder from the bottom all over again.In the end, we spend the majority of our waking lives working, so we should really try and do what we love. It's never too late to make a career change into something you're actually passionate about and wake up looking forward to doing.",

If you’re looking for something more in-depth, \"Learning Python\" by Mark Lutz is a classic and covers all the fundamentals. Lastly, if you’re into data science, \"Python for Data Analysis\" by Wes McKinney is a must-read :bar_chart:. These books will keep you engaged and help you apply what you learn.

Every tiny line that did something felt like casting a spell. But if that hadn’t been the case, I’d probably have quit.So here’s the key:Find your line between “I’m learning and just grinding through it” and “I’m doing something that gives me satisfaction.”Don’t force what just doesn’t click.Also. People like us... well , oftentimes we are just exploring everything that comes to mind.Don't feel bad quitting if it doesn't speaks to youThis goes a bit beyond your question, but...I think we kind of operate through resonance.And resonance can be fleeting, unpredictable.I know all too well how frustrating it can be to feel like you can’t steer your life the way you intended, like you’re restarting over and over, and nothing really sticks.Truth is, I’m only now starting to gather and make sense of things after 40 years of possibly doing just a little of everything.But you know… this is how we are.We can either keep fighting ourselves, or start using this for what it’s worthSo, aside from the hack of “make it rewarding\", keep this in mind: we’re nonlinear learners.Back in school, I could weave a web of interdisciplinary connections so dense it would stun people. But I couldn’t remember a single date or place to save my life. My memory just picked what to keep on its own terms.Sound familiar?That’s the point: we struggle when we try to force ourselves into linear paths.We operate differently. And that difference needs to be acknowledged, not treated like a flaw.Maybe i should add this.I'm not saying quit whenever you feel like it, no problem. I'm saying there are some known methods to cope with adhd, and a personalized reward system is one of them. Gamification too.I'm saying, abandon guilt and feeling of being wrong. Abandon frustration. It's not helping you",

Unless it's for an exam you're taking, I'd just move on and keep learning other things and come back to reduce later. The essence of reduce could be rewritten like this:``` result = initialValue for v in someSet: result = doSomething(result, v)``` instead of:```result = reduce(initialValue, someSet, doSomething)```(Note, I'm not using JS syntax in particular, just sudo code.)Cutting it down to a single line is nice and all, but 3 lines isn't bad either.",

The idea is to combine all the elements of an array \"somehow\" by going through one at a time, and doing some calculation on each of them, keeping track of the \"accumulation\" in its own variable as you go. As you noted the classic example is just adding up all the numbers in an array, where the \"somehow\" is the function: \\`return total\\_so\\_far + the\\_current\\_number\\` and the \"accumulation\" is a running total.A different example could be finding the max number in an array. It's not the fastest way to do it, but if you have an unordered array then you might provide the \"somehow\" as \\`return max(the\\_current\\_number, the\\_max\\_so\\_far)\\` then by the end the the\\_max\\_so\\_far variable has whatever the max value of the array is.Or you could have an ordered array of chapter objects that you want to output into a combined book, so the \"somehow\" is like \\`return book + this\\_chapter.to\\_s()\\`So instead of a big ugly loop with temp variables you could just do \\`book\\_text = chapters.reduce(string.empty, (book, chapter) => book + chapter.to\\_s())\\` To be clear, as with basically everything in programming, you can of course do all this without \\`reduce()\\`, and you just have to choose based on clarity of intent whether to use it or not.",

Or I use AI to summarize something at the highest level and dig into the unfamiliar bits from there. Hardest part of learning something new for me is being overwhelmed by so much new stuff that I don't know where to start.Anyway, hopefully this explanation of reduce will help:So you said you understand map and forEach? Perfect! You're close to understanding reduce because all 3 share one foundational behavior: Run a function on each item of the array.Now, here's how they differ:forEach: You want to just call the function for each item in the array. You don't necessarily want to do anything to the items or the array itself and you don't want to return anything.map: You want to transform each item in the array into a new value. Example: You have an array with the values 1,2,3? Use map to transform the array into a new array with the values 2,4,6. The key here is your goal is to transform the original array into a new array with new items. The new array is an array of the same length as the original. Start with 3 items in your array? You'll end with 3 items in your new array.reduce: Similarly to map, your goal is to transform the array into something else. However, that something else can be anything! With map, you return a new array. With reduce, you return a new ANYTHING. You can turn the original array into an object (most common use case) or you can return a number, string, boolean, literally whatever you want. Example: Have an array of 1,2,3? Use reduce to return the sum of all numbers.",

Write a function to, I don't know, calculate the totalPrice of a list of Product objects, each with its own price ... Here's the solution, just so you know what I mean: function calculateTotalPrice(products) { let totalPrice = 0; for(const product of products) { totalPrice += product.price; } return totalPrice; } Then, when that works, write a more generic function, that doesn't know about product.price, but takes another function as a parameter, one that returns the value to add to the totalPrice. Meaning that this function should be able to calculate any total.And continue on to you have basically re-implemented .reduce with your own code.It is important that you write it yourself, using your own thinking, and not get the solution from somewhere else, because it isn't about the solution, it is about the thinking that goes into it.That is how I learned most of the array-functions (filter, map, etc.), coming from the old procedural way of thinking, I wrote my own implementation (with loads of bugs and imperfections) to understand what was going on. And the benefit of using the builtin functions, is that other people know what they mean and can read it quickly, but having to understand someone elses implementation always requires having to read a lot of code, until you realize: ah, he's just reducing!",

Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users \"multi-instance ready\" instead of identifying the bottleneck.3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage. (Turns out the service was not multi-instance ready and they all crashed)4. Distributed systems are HARD. People love to add microservices willy nilly because it looks cool in the diagrams, but just really try to avoid it. I usually play devils advocate for just making a big monolith. Stick to conway's law, that's fine, but NO JOHN WE DO NOT NEED 11 FUNCTION APPS WITH 300LOC EACH JUST BECAUSE YOU READ ABOUT THE ADAPTER PATTERN AND KAFKA IN SOME BOOK.

I highly doubt it, unless it's a very niche situation like that one.I mostly use VS Code, by the way, because for my workflows that's the fastest and most efficient, and it has extensions for all the tools I need.

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).That said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.Overall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast. Editing code, refactoring code, and navigating between functions, files, and folders will be instant. But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.I'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically \"not faster than me at all\" or they're something like \"10% faster than me at best\". There's always the rare exception, the sweaty nerd who's so good at Vim that they're flying through code and edits at light speed, but they're rare, and I'd suggest that \"it has more to do with them\" than it does \"Vim\". They're SPECIAL, let's say.",

When you establish an initial contact, go over the following* Ask what they hope to get out of the tutoring? Are they primarily interested in learning concepts?* Inform them what you're willing to do for them* Inform them what you're not willing to do for themI can imagine two kinds of students that would want tutoring. First, there's those that are being forced to get a tutor because they are struggling. Maybe parents are pushing them. This can also work the other way where parents are trying to get their kids ahead. Second would be an older learner who just wants to get started. They are likely more motivated.The difficulty in tutoring is whether students want you to do their homework for them, or do their projects for them. This is cheating. If you don't want to facilitate that, you should indicate that ahead of time.For example, you can explain a scenario to the student where you say \"If you say to me 'I have to turn in this programming assignment by tomorrow, or I'll get a zero, and I've barely started!', I'm going to tell you, no, I don't do that. You should plan ahead on your assignments and not rely on me to do them for you.\"Setting expectations is something you should do.You learn to teach as you go along, so what works for one student might not work for another.",

The latter, typically older students, feel that a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of a subject hinders their ability to tackle practical applications. Personally, I strive to strike a balance between these two approaches for each student, ensuring that they acquire a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms rather than merely memorizing random words that magically work on their computers, browsers, or phones.",

I would think a theorist wants to know more of the theory, unless what you're saying is they DO think this way, but know that they ALSO need to think practically and therefore want a tutor.Does that mean you don't have students who know a lot of practical stuff, but don't know much theory like a CS student would (or should).",

Don't write an OS that runs on bare metal, that needs hardware drivers, dealing with JTAG, bootloaders, tons of work just to write Hello World to a serial port. But you can learn almost as much about how things really work by implementing a threading model in userspace using [setjmp/longjmp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setjmp.3.html).

Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control. With games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true. Typically the lag will come from one player not verifying the previous simulation slice fast enough.",

Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.Lets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",

I'm pretty sure there's some bottom floor to the rock speed so instead of lowering the speed any more, the game lags2.) there's some fundamental problem in the Clausewitz engine paradox games made that causes the game to lag when hitting that lower bound where it processes stack up causing lag. I assume this is bc the CPU usage is wildly inconsistent second to second due to a possible lack of multi threading engine architecture, so the games frequently max out cpu usage at 100%. This is why the lag can sometimes disappear when lowering game speed by one level even though tick speed didn't change.RimWorld does not have this problem in my experience and only really experiences lag from running out of memory (or poorly optimized mods).",

With Qt and Slint you actually write the layout of your UI using a custom language and then you can connect to the markup via Rust, C++, Python, JavaScript. In a sense it can feel like web programming: you have a separate markup file and event listeners.You can also target OS-native APIs from C++, C#, or Swift if you want to build apps for specific platforms only.And there are many other widget libraries, either language-specific (like Glimmer for Ruby) or cross-language, like wxWidgets or GTK. There are many-many choices and also many libraries that wrap other libraries. Like, with wxWidgets in order to target Linux you can use wxGTK or wxQt, and similar things exist for other platforms.I would first decide whether cross-platform support is a must, and then pick a language and look for options for that specific language.",

        "body": "Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:**Start with a clear theme**They rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.**Component architecture: two clear categories**- Templates:These are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.- Traditional components:These do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. - **Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**Most components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.**Type safety everywhere**They use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.Types are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.**Always validate backend data**First thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early. If something is wrong, I’d rather have it fail immediately than cause weird bugs later.",

Before AI I would routinely copy over boilerplate stuff from my personal repositories that I had built up. Now I just tell the AI what I need.If you're a beginner then I would recommend using the AI to help you set your boilerplate and some hints on implementation detail. Once you master a concept and feel comfortable doing it yourself then you probably know how to ask the AI to do it and you can verify correctness. Never just ask the AI to do something in nontechnical language and copy paste results. It'll work until it doesn't work.

Intermediate concepts have a tendency to come organically. For instance, memory management, vectors and pointers are not really worth looking into if you're a complete beginner, however whilst working with fundamental concepts, you will eventually have a need for a dynamic array, or will want to edit variables inside of a function - it is at this point you'll learn these more advanced concepts.In terms of \"real world projects\", just automate one aspect of your life, then move onto another, as you get better at coding you'll discover things you can automate you previously didn't realise.",

The user database also stores a \"confirmed\" flag, which is initially false, meaning the account cannot log in.Also during the signup process, the user gets sent an Email with a signup code or link. when they attempt to log in, they get prompted for the signup code, or told to click the link. Once they do that, the accounts `confirmed` flag is changed to `true`. To make this better, the confirmation code (which may be part of the confirmation link), can be stored in a table linked to the account with a set timeout.This is the account verification process.The password rest works in a similar way. When a user clicks the \"forgot password\" link, an Email with a reset-link / code is sent out. The code is stored in a reset database, with the record linking code and account id and having a timeout. If the user enters the code they got sent, they are redirected to a config page where they can change their password.This is the password reset process.Both of these processes rely on the assumption, that the user has sole control over the Email account.",

If you can handle bodily fluids, nursing is always in demand. I think the best balance between job security and decent pay is to get into a field that requires both brains and physical presence on site - needing to do some schooling to get in filters out the applicant pool some and drives wages up, but needing to actually be there to work with your hands/body means you're way less vulnerable to automation or being off-shored.",

I have learning difficulties and struggle a lot with math, and I tried learning web dev on my own twice and even the basics were hell for me.**Simple answer is no. I understand it might sound harsh and there will be people who feel we should say yes to you and send you on a boondoggle. But in all honesty this is not the path for you.1) It is a VERY competitive field. If you're struggling to learn the absolute basics you are going to drown here.2) It requires good social skills as much as anything else. Developer jobs are not Hollywood cases of a dude in a basement. You need to be engaged with the business. Able to drive conversations about needs and requirements. To provide feedback etc. So do not go down this route thinking that it is some easy path in that regard.There are many paths in life. Dev is not for everyone, and if we take your comments here at face value then it is not for you. Have a look at what options there are that better suit your interests. Regardless you will have to develop your social skills. There is pretty much zero exception there, so if I were you I would work on addressing those first.Then start exploring options. Careers are hard because often we don't know what we don't know. Which leads people to aim for the high profile stuff like software div / engineer / lawyer. But there are MANY other options out there.",

As others have mentioned too, the SLT executives also don't pay for quality execution and productization either (UI/UX, actual internal tooling, Quality assurance testing, organizational software to actually help PMs and engineers, etc.).It's not just being cheap on Total Compensation. Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.People like to joke about Amazon's \"frugality\" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.Edit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary. I would say that's quite a milestone for a big company, right? Let's just say when Windows 11 came out, we all got to pick out pretty fantastic goodies (sweaters, premium jackets, memorabilia's, etc.). For the 50th...I got to pick out a Teams background. And watch 3 CEOs pat each other on the back. Oh, and more copilot features (internal copilot is garbage tier and extremely watered down).",

For example, let’s say you worked for Looker when they were smaller and trying to sell their BI tool. You would make dashboards showing off the tool and also be able to answer technical questions. Pros of this job: you do basic coding but depending on the product is how difficult it will get. Get to speak with people and not be cooped up on your own all day. I’ve also heard that Sales Engineers make bank, but that’s purely anecdotal. Cons: have to deal with customers, type of coding might not be as “fulfilling” as pushing something to production at another company. Salary might be tied to sales targets.",

        "body": "Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.It doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.Now the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.In a gold rush, sell shovels.The problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon:trade_mark:.Personally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.AI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",

        "body": "I think in some instances it is just never having enough money and constantly moving the goalposts for yourself. Having said that, there are two things I tend to think about:1. Stagnating is a great way to jeopardize your financial future. You stay at the $170K company with a chill job, you don't keep advancing in your career, and then in 10 years when the company decides to lay you off... now what? Recruiters want to see growth, and you will just be able to say \"I've been in the same spot for like 10 years\". Especially in an ageist industry that evolves quickly, you really don't want to find yourself obsolete at 40.2. Inflation. When I graduated college 20 years ago, $100K was a lot of money. Now you need $160K to have the purchasing power that $100K did back then. So if inflation is going up higher than your salary (which is likely if you don't seek advancement opportunities), you might gradually lose purchasing power - and pretty substantially.3. Even with lifestyle creep, you will often find yourself accumulating wealth in other ways as your salary goes up. Bigger 401K, the bigger house you bought gets a bunch of equity + appreciation in it, etc.4. Accumulating extra experience early can actually land you in better work life balance later. Which, let me tell you - I'm happy to have the good work life balance at 40 (when I'm tired and have kids) than at 26 (when I had way more energy and no kids to worry about)",

I've currently been interviewing for hardware roles in some of the world top tech companies (including FAANGs). Thus far, 100% of interviewers were either Chinese or Indian. All of them hold a MSEE or a PhD in EE/CE. One may argue that it takes a PhD to design high frequency power converters for on-board EV charging but I beg to differ. Design and test skills are best learned on the job, not in school. It's not about talent, it's about willingness to take it up the a** and shut up and comply. \"If it means I get to keep my $70,000 job and have the chance to live in the USA, I will take it.\"This \"shortage\" is one big ploy and grift, set up and lobbied for by the billionaires who need to meet their quarterly earnings NOW, not later. The more they push the myth - the more they can employ cheaper and desperate foreign workers. Increased profits and lower labor costs. And once employed, their managers can hold a gun to their head such that if they don't perform or comply or work late hours, their and their families \"American Dream\" will fall apart.

Moving requires an updated petition so you cannot apply based on LCOL area salary and move to a HCOL area. You can keep living in this persecution fantasy that H1B workers have some kind of competitive advantage against you when in reality it costs an extra 10-30k to onboard them and possibly months in paperwork plus the uncertainty of a lottery. No sane hiring manager picks the visa candidate against a US person when all else is equal.The H1B annual quota has not increased for years. It's a completely minuscule impact compared to offshoring and neglible compared to the overall SWE job market contraction since peak COVID times.

Inadequate and easily gamed by playing with the role title. H1b basically never audited and LCA's must be approved within 7 days.Congress has it's head so far up it's ass. In what way is it competitive and supportive of innovations to allow corporations to effectively indenture their workforce and prevent them from hopping to competitors or quitting to start their own company to produce a better rival technology.Silicon Valley was so dynamic in the 70's 80's and 90's in part because CA does not enforce non compete agreements. H1b really breaks those.Also the US never had talent shortages in industry or academia until these visa programs screwed up labor conditions and wages...Even Elon has talked about how talented Americans avoid actual stem careers and go into finance and other industries bc STEM is unappealing (which I'd argue is because of the wage and working perversion by these visa programs.)[How and Why Government, Universities and Industry Create 'Labor Shortages' of Skilled Americans](https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/Weinstein-GUI_NSF_SG_Complete_INET.pdf)You can look at what chinese software engineers make in an actual free market which is not oursourced or perverted by visa immigration.

You picked a rough time to hunker down & get serious but fuck it, we ball.Without relevant experience, contributing to open source is the next best thing. Even today with 5 YoE, recruiters get shook at that one contribution I did in 2023 to the most popular logging solution for Salesforce. The other thing you can do is build your own projects to demonstrate you can build new things from scratch. Start simple, build a blog, add comments, add the ability to subscribe via email, tie it in to a content-management system - Lotta places need blogs. Once that's done, chronical your open source contributions & post tech-related content on there. There's a certain \"man's is published, he knows what he's doing\" energy from having a nice blog.Essentially the goal is to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that you have *something* to put on a resume & something to talk about in an interview. A nice plus is if your projects make money - could be a small amount, even just $1-5 / month is noteworthy. A lot of people are giving you shit - but we all started from nothing at some point, it might take 6-12 months for you to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that it lands you a job - but a year from now is a year from now regardless of what you do now. It may as well be the case that a year from now you work in tech as opposed to not.",

Every ten or so people you add to an organization, the dynamic will change rapidly and you'll need to retune the operations. This is before the complexity of market strategy and building an MVP to sell.Do try organizing! But keep it small and sustainable. As an independent founder coming from layoffs, you probably don't have *any* meaningful \"runway\" to fail and bleed out money until the core business solidifies. In the mean time, while you're getting that set up, make sure you take on a boring job that pays the bills.

Do those three things well, and you're a decent lead.That said, I'm a Senior in a Team Lead role, and I definitely agree that it's not for everyone. At least at my company, there's an understanding that the role should be filled with a Staff engineer, and although I felt like I had to step up, there are plenty of other seniors engineers in the org who could step up as well. I eventually want to get promoted to Staff Engineer, so it seemed like good experience to be a tech lead and deliver on a big prjoect.If you want to just be an IC, which I think is acceptable, then it's not going to work out. They hired you for the role, and asking for additional money to do the job they hired you for isn't going to go over well. I think they did make a mistake not hiring someone with leadership experience and putting them in a lead role, but they think they can get that on the market, and it's a reasonable expectation.",

There is clearly a disconnect between how you see yourself and how they see the role that you are employed to operate.I’d also encourage you to bring some of these questions to these people. “What’s the point in leading meetings, id rather just listen to the subject-matter experts” is a question that I’d bet they would be happy to expand on, for example.Technical leadership is difficult, and for better or worse, the higher levels of engineering are just as much about people and process as they are about technology.

One thing he continuously emphasized is that it's a *copilot*. We are still the pilots. He himself said that the most dangerous thing about Copilot, and the biggest disasters he's seen, are people that trust it. Copilot is a tool that can help us quickly get through mundane tasks. It is not a resource that can be used to blindly generate code we ship to production. *The creators* are telling us that it should not be used for blind code generation. That's telling.A funny thing about those trainings that I noticed is that the instructor himself struggled a lot during all his demos because the AI wouldn't co-operate, and he had to live debug why things weren't working the way he wanted. It's very telling when a *live demo to a major customer* goes haywire.I use AI the exact same way I use StackOverflow. It's a tool to get me information, or get quick answers to mundane tasks. It's *not* something I just copy/paste. It *augments* my abilities, it doesn't generate my code. It's just a faster Google, and Google/StackOverflow results also need to be taken with a big ass grain of salt.",

Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,\"And it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.And then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.It did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.But overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.So next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with \"Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code\". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.So lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.But where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",

Some may be lucky enough to find another role internally, but losing your job hurts and is a very stressful time.A silver lining perhaps is that these losses seem to be Seattle-focused. If laid-off, being in Seattle and a current employee will almost certainly put you at the top of the list for hiring, in the area where the most jobs are.What I'll also add is that it's worth noting where these layoffs have occurred. Devices is a huge org, but many of the divisions are ones where new products were recently launched or are due to be launched. That's not a great look for Amazon, especially if the new versions of Alexa, Zoox, or Kuiper start to suffer issues. It's equally a really shitty look internally if these are successful - why the fuck would you work hard to make something a success when your payoff is losing your job?",

They produce code no where near JR levels and most mid to sr employees spend more time fighting the AI to do basic shit that it takes away from business goals. Ok now why are companies claiming they are getting gains?? Well it's simple. Money. Managers and execs make more money by laying off employees and squeezing the existing labor for all it's worth. And also they know the products are going to be absolutely garbage but they do not give a fuck as long as they have that multi year contract linked.They set up deals like a house if cards, demand massive bonuses, pay PR firms to fluff their profiles, then bounce before it all comes down.

Once you get to a proper \"codebase\", it flounders and just can't keep track of everything because it doesn't have a grasp on \"broad concepts\" like human reasoning allows us to do.Then these companies will either collapse, or they'll see the wave coming and rehire developers who will then have to clean up 10 million lines of AI slop to ship some half-baked product. Looking at the broader picture, this \"AI Revolution\" is one of those things that humanity just has to buckle down and get through it, like A-tracks or Watergate. It's an inevitable stepping stone towards greater futures and something we simply have to suffer through as developers. That's not to say AI isn't here to stay - it is - but its current iteration has more potential than kinetic energy.That said, now is probably not the best time to jump into front-end web development or small mobile app dev because they will be the first positions eliminated, following data entry.",

The market is tough right now and you're going to have to suck it up and basically throw everything you have at this if you truly want it. Each thing your do here increases your chances of success: Before interviewing- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. - come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, - build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot- create a portfolio siteSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:- dont be as stringent about pay- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)- be willing to relocate- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. - always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. Most importantly...- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead. Don't doom yourself, if you get rejected sometimes it has nothing to do with what you did and is out of your control, and lastly, JUST KEEP BUILDING LEARNING AND GROWING!!! EVERY DAY!!",

After that, I heard it's pretty chill though.I do agree it seems way more stable though, and the interview process seems much much much much much easier. Not even close.With tech though, the work is more interesting and the pay is generally a lot higher. Those are pretty big positives.I totally hear you about the 'deterministic' work though. Ugh, I have a new task that I have no idea how to do so I'm going to have to research it. It's on a tight timeline too so I've unfortunately been thinking about it during my weekends and after-work-hours too :(. I would love to just 'know what to do' all the time. It would make SWE a lot less stressful, but also a bit boring.",

Salary is only better once and if you make partner, but that’s not the life for most.My dad boasted making 16,500 monthly by the end of his career with 2 sources of income. My solo income peaked at 10,000 monthly and combined income with wife already beat that number at early 30s. Sure you can say adjust inflation we’d still come short, but you get the picture.Their interviews are definitely easier but also very deterministic. You don’t have X experience? You won’t ever get that job or straight up down leveled by 1 or 2. In SWE if you are frontend developer you can still have a very decent shot at a fullstack/backend developer job. Don’t have FFANG? No one really cares, sure it gets you through recruiter better, but 99% of jobs don’t care.Remember that PM you dislike? Now just imagine it’s a client and they are intentionally being an asshole to get less hours counted for billing against them.AI proof?

Imagine all the time you spend coding is instead spent reading tax documents and crunching numbers in Excel. And despite your belief that accountants don’t have to deal with debugging, a lot of the work is checking for mistakes in tax documents/filings and referencing various tax laws to try to figure out why numbers don’t line up.You also imply accountants have better WLB. Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.Lastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do. Just do a quick Google search for AI accounting tools and look at how many results pop up.The only thing accounting has on software engineering right now is stability, but if you want more stability for generally shittier pay there’s way better jobs for that.",

Not the case. I'm given a puzzle that I've never done before, given a deadline to finish it, and asked every single day (multiple times) how close I am to finishing it.This is not true. You're talking about book-keeping. Accounting - which is much broader - can be an extremely complex job depending on what you're working on. It is rarely deterministic.Again, you're confusing modern accounting with old school accounting.>The fact that once they do their time at the Big 4 + get their CPA, they are basically set for life. The grind ACTUALLY seems to pay off in their career. The issue with this logic is that the equivalent of getting your CPA and doing your time at a Big 4 is not \"average SWE job\". You need a 5 years BS+MS degree, pass the CPA certification, and then be a really, really good candidate. Like, if you were a CS MS grad from a top 50 school and got accepted to a FAANG you would also be set for life. And you wouldn't have to live through those 60-80 hour weeks working at a big 4. >In tech? You have to study LeetCode, OOP, System Design over and over and over every time you want to job hopThis is also not true. I have worked at a bunch of companies that never did \"grind to prepare for this\" interviews. And the more experience you get, the less likely this is to happen.>The fact that it's a stable job and literally everyone needs them.I think this is valid, but the trade-off is money. And again - Big 4 money is great, but Big 4 money is not what the average accountant is making, and if you're an average developer, you're not going to be an elite accountant.>The fact that their interviews consist of 1-2 behavioural rounds and that's literally it1. This isn't accurate as most of them are going to be asked to work through a business case or something along those lines, but also 2. Part of it is that it's a regulated industry so not only do you have to get and maintain a CPA, but your work is also much more likely to hard to f\\*\\*\\* up without someone noticing. Like, accounting is not a field where you \"fail fast\", where \"don't let good enough get in the way of perfect\" flies. Which mind you - is the thing that can make it extremely taxing.>Immune to AI and offshoring due to legal reasonsImmune to offshoring, sure.Immune to AI - way less immune than developers. Because you don't even need AI - decent ML could take a huge axe to accounting jobs. That just hasn't happened yet, but the risk is there, and much higher than the odds that you will automate developers.",

I am dealing with a very tricky health issue, get an appointment at our renowned medical school, only to find out I'll be seen by a NP (nurse practitioner). Not very confidence inspiring never mind my primary care provider is an NP or as my kid calls them, a noctor /s but it's the reality of where healthcare is going (i work software for a large healthcare administration company). Third, i get the meaningful part. Having worked in the automotive industry for three decades i had the same desire. It does feel meaningful to see your stuff in action.Having said all that, I'd say try big pharma, some health tech, and medical devices companies. Or any embedded really, automotive or aerospace. My partner worked 15 years in big pharma manufacturing. Her software helped make many very popular meds.

Goobie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25LUF8GmbFU). to summarize, although medicine is can save the lives of many patients, medicine can only do so much saving and the other form of relief also comes from the patient's own habits and behavior. if you believe that your role as a doctor is to guide and fix (realizing that not all problems can be fixed), and this matters to you, then medicine isn't a bad idea in this aspect.also, if you don't mind me asking, how did you become both a premed and CS major in college? that sounds like something i'll be interested in",

Even mediocre engineers have landed \\*something\\* after a few months of being laid off.When it comes to senior engineers (5+ YOE), I don't know anyone who's had trouble landing offers (if they're a citizen, considers relocating and open to hybrid).As a side note, my team has been interviewing recently and the quality of the candidates we're getting has been pretty bad. Tons of people are blatantly cheating with AI. The majority of the other candidates can't answer basic system design questions, clearly lied during their behavioral interviews, can't solve leetcode medium questions or lied in their application about not requiring sponsorship.

If they're accessing this information after you already accepted an offer, there's really not a lot of malicious things they can do with your work history as long as that history isn't noteworthy - like, if you've had standard jobs, those are the jobs listed on your resume, and you've had reasonable salary progression along the way.But if you don't fall in that category, you should be very careful with this info. Things that immediately come to mind:* If you \"embelished\" or straight up lied about your current compensation during salary negotiations. Like, if you said you were making $200K and they used that info to offer you $240K and then they find out you're actually making $150K, that could have negative repercussions* If you had any jobs that you didn't put on your resume that you might not want them to see - like, if you said you had an employment gap but were actually doing work for a somewhat controversial company. Or if you lied about having a job or how long you were there.* As OP said - union membership, reason for termination, etc. I feel like those are all touchy subjects that could have repercussions.All that to say - I think for a lot of people, this doesn't really matter that much. But you probaby should look at it and figure out if it does - especially if something in there is wrong.",

        "body": "I think being the \"Go-To Person\" is awesome, but not how you describe it.I think there's a separate issue with your company that you're experiencing. Your company has an information/support problem. Because there's no documentation, or proper support, or any sort of information distribution to the rest of the company, you're getting pinged constantly. You're being pulled into meetings that don't actually need you, just because ***you're*** the documentation. They want you there just in case. Going into a meeting without you would be like trying to code without Google. When people run into issues they ping you because ***you're Google***.You can fix that. Just setting up a random Teams channel and telling them to send their questions there is a start, but it's not enough. Also, it's useless if you keep answering direct-pings. If you get direct pings, politely redirect them to the dev channel. You don't need to come off as if you're avoiding helping them, you can hide it under the guise of \"visibility\" to others.But the \"Go-To Person\" at a company that *doesn't* suffer from that is the person management comes to when they need to *get shit done*. They aren't going to waste your talents asnwering stupid questions in a support channel. When there's some really hard task that *needs* to be done fast, and right the first time, they point immediately at the \"Go-To Person\", they don't want to risk giving that ticket to anyone else in the team. You're the tool they use when they don't have any margin for error, because they know you don't need any.*That's* my experience as the \"Go-To Person\". I always naturally fall into that role, and its great. I've done some awesome things, I've pulled some miracles, I get interesting work, I have the trust of my management.

First, it’s a team of exceptional people who attained the title of staff+ naturally. This could be a stellar move for your career if this were the case. The second, and probably more likely, possibility is less rosy. It’s a team of older engineers who are content to stay in one place and keep the lights on. They‘ve been at this place so long that their COL raises may have forced HR to put them in a higher pay band. I’ve seen both of these. I left the second one within 5 months and it was damaging to my career. I got paged constantly, there were memory leaks, they were deploying by building artifacts locally and dropping them into prod servers with ftp. You need to figure out what end this falls on.",

Being disciplined and self-motivated is a MUST in the modern tech market. Also, your resume is likely to be filtered out by the ATS. It will be very hard to overcome that with some projects, unfortunately. It’s your life though! If you have the time and discipline, software can work. I don’t know how much time you mean by “quite a while”, so it’s up to you. It’s just very hard to get noticed. Your time might be more valuable elsewhere, if money is your main concern. To answer your final question though, its not likely that your old degree+bootcamp makes you competitive. You’d have to do a lot more. The resume gap and ageism is particularly negative in software, unfortunately :(Definitely look into programming as a hobby, no matter what you choose to do. Sorry again about your family",

The interview process was generally:* HR Intro Call* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen* On-site panel interview for 2 hours / 2 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour eachFrankly it's harder to get an offer now, because companies are more picky. They are scared to death of a false positive hire and will sacrifice the false negative hire all day every day. I personally think there are tons of talent out there that with some ramp up time on the job would be an excellent SWE.Every company I have worked for over my 15 YOE never really had issues hiring once candidates applied. Granted these were non-tech companies in non-tech cities so they were not hiring out of the same pool of candidates as bit tech companies. If you could do reverse a string level problems with C or C++ you would get an offer. These companies were fine with ramp up time and showing candidates, at all levels, what they needed to know to do the job. Just finding people that had an aptitude for being a SWE was the problem. Aptitude does not mean some rock star coder, but could wrap their head around concepts when shown to them.Granted I've never applied to a startup, so maybe that world is different.",

        "body": "It is much more a consequence of the company values.Bad work culture and bad work/life balance aren't the same thing than having high operational target metrics.Amazon has an intentional culture of employees being always working, always tethered to operations, and committing to die at the job. They make you feel bad for taking more than a week of vacation in a year of 12 hours work days. That's more a correlation than a causation but Bezos doesn't see it that way and since he's writing the checks, that's how it works. This is not specific to AWS and affects other areas at Amazon which are less tied to operations. Regardless they built the narrative that such shitty conditions are simply the result of the nature of the job, that if you're not always on the edge of burnout, the business will crumble and the competition will overtake them. Most people have known nothing else so they believe it.Other sectors and countries have laws so that demanding jobs don't ruin the life of people. For obvious reasons, truckers cannot drive more than X hours per day. Airline pilots must observe rest times, etc. Because obviously pushing these limits isn't good. It doesn't mean we can't have trucks and airplanes, it means we had to find ways to make it work and compensate for the demanding conditions of such jobs, often in the form of regulations against abuses. Companies still find ways to be competitive.In some other countries if you are on-duty you need to be compensated for that even if the pager doesn't ring. Being available for the job is considered a work related duty so it needs to be compensated. If you join the call for an incident the law requires the employer to clock hours in addition to your regular pay -- even if you're not an hourly employee. On holidays you get up to double pay. And their online services aren't more or less reliable.The US tech has close to no worker protection laws so the only things that retains companies to crush employees is how long they want to keep them and how easily they can find a job elsewhere. That somewhat works if the job market is balanced and companies are compelled to watch wlb to be attractive. This is often made easier by the general American narrative that government is a bad thing, that politics are here to trick us not to protect us, so employees hope for their company to do the right thing by themselves and rarely think about forms of civil action.",

If it’s not mitigated every 15 minutes passed it will page the next in line, so an issue that has been going for an hour would have the VP and like 20 other on call engineers getting yelled at trying to mitigate the issue. By the way that happened every other day, and when that’s not happening you’re resolving tickets of minor issues.

Before you do–and maybe wait until after you are sure you can find something else–maybe suggest the book “working with legacy code” or something like that to the manager.

Makes things way more manageable and maintainable. It also allows you to make changes if ever necessary.Tbh I’m surprised teams like this still work in this manner. What does this system do?",

All it takes is one management change, one bad/good quarter, hell even one SWE hire can flip a team's culture upside down. It's only a matter of time.With that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that. Once the WLB changes for the worse, and I'm *forced* to job hop is when I'll get the nice salary bump to be re-adjusted to market rate.$40k-$55k extra wouldn't make me consider leaving an otherwise good gig for even a moment. Irrespective of market, but it's doubly true in bad markets. If we're talking about $40k to $80k it'd be a different conversation, but $110k to $150k wouldn't cause me to jump ship.That's just me though. These are *my* priorities, and *my* goals in life. My answer only makes sense in that context. Someone that's foused on grinding money would think I'm crazy, and in their world, I am. Different strokes.Think about what's important to *you*.",

Don’t fall for this, there are jobs with great pay and great WLB and there are jobs with shit pay and shit WLB. At large companies, WLB is totally dependent on the team as well.2. No job is perfectly secure. Lots of people who were working for the government, gov. contractors, and research institutions who thought they would have a job forever are now looking. The best job security is the kind you make yourself, by having a diverse skillset and a wide reaching network. Working at different places is the easiest way to do that. 3. there’s absolutely no harm in submitting some resumes and taking a few interviews. You’re actually in the best possible position. You don’t need a job right now, you have one that you like and could stay at. You’re not in any hurry. Only apply for jobs here and there that seem very interesting to you, that meet your preferences (remote, etc.). If you do a couple interviews and git a whiff of bad WLB, bail. If you do go through all the way and get an offer, start your negotiations at a stupid high salary, what do you have to lose?",

Best thing you can do is talk to PMs/BAs at your current job (if you’re still working) and get mentorship from them, see if you can slowly start owning smaller product stuff. Make it known internally you want some growth on that side. If you’re currently unemployed, it’ll be an uphill battle for sure. It’s doable in a good job market if you tailor your resume to talk about how you worked cross functionally, gathered requirements, etc but as it stands now you’re competing against people who actually have that experience - these roles are not just BS office job stuff.Completely different set of skills that are required",

What did you learn from them, even if they weren't necessarily 100% developer growth? Did you learn anything from going through the internal company politics? Startups fire people all the time, for me the question is what did you learn and how do you want to apply that going forward? Don't think of it as a purely technical question. Think about the people, processes, and the exchange between different teams that you noticed. Only four months in a job is a speed bump at the very beginning of your career. What you need to do is not let it get to you. Everyone goes through these types of situations. And I mean everyone.

I had trouble finding work recently and hooked up with a firm that got me placed at a company that I couldn’t secure and interview for directly.

A couple years later, that open source project got me scouted into a big tech company for another 150% increase. My pay at this company more than doubled in the 8 years I've been there. I make and have enough money now that I don't really need to work anymore (I still do because I like the work, but my wife quit the rat race)By contrast, there's this guy that occasionally posts in salary progression threads here who worked 15 years in a single non-tech company with the steady 3% raises throughout. He was at low one hundies mark when he left his job and hasn't found a job in a few years, last time he gave an update.I think these two points should give you a decent idea of the range of possibilities going forward from where you are.

I made good money but it was stressful and I lost my job due to the high expectations and me not meeting it. Sometimes the fast paced job is not all that it seems. If you are happy with the money you make, the company culture, etc. It's ok not being the guy who is always innovative and working on things that change the world. We are told from the second we decide to be engineers that we need to work on things that change the world and when we are stagnant we feel like we are \"stealing money\". Staying at this company can increase job security too. Im sure many people your age are job-hopping to more money but more stressful jobs. Your company may appreciate how you stayed, give you huge promotions and when it comes down to layoffs they wont consider laying off a person who has been there 10+ years and knows the system and someone who everybody loves. To see the other side of the coin, it is completely fine being the person who wants to work extra create innovative code, etc. All i say is dont do it because you are under this impression SWEs need to be on the go all the time.",

And also this explains a lot about private equity at the moment too. You can gut a company for parts for a hundred million bucks or you'd better be pulling in 7-8 Million in profit every year and lots of things don't do that right now.

That seems like an extremely arbitrary way to make that distinction, it's just a name. It's not a Professional Engineer license, or any sort of official, legal classification... it's a word.Only explanation I can think of is do you have a BS? Or a BSE? Your friend who is pursing a Software Engingeering degree, are *they* getting a BS? or a BSE?That *is* an official distinction, it's the type of degree you're getting. A Bachelor of Science vs a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, so maybe that explains it?Computer Science degrees can fall under either. My CS degree is a BSE for example, but you could get either at my school. If you got your CS degree through the liberal arts school, you'd get a BS. If you got it through the engineering school, you'd get a BSE. But the core program requirements were identical, there was just some minor differences in electives.If that's the case, maybe you could consider pursuing an MSE? It sounds like you like your job, and it's a decent gig, so I'd hate for you to leave it just over an arbitrary gate. Have you spoken to your manager about options? Or specifics on the policy?

I only apply to jobs with adjacent tech stack if they directly mention that it's ok to not meet all of their tech stack qualifications now.",

AI, no AI, it doesn't matter, the buck has to stop with someone, and that's a variety of managers.I do think there is truth to your statement, though. At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the \"team of teams\" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.In my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.After all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team. Maybe that's niave, but the only way to be trusted to build anything significant, or lead, is to have a manager agree to the spend.",

It sucks, yes, but that's just how it is.I can't tell you what you should learn. You have the skills to figure that out yourself. Look at Stackoverflow's yearly survey and see what people use. Google around a bit. Look at job postings to see what technologies are in demand. Pick something to learn based on what interests you and what seems relevant to you.Also, it was due to stagnation that I left my first job, and I have never looked back.",

        "body": "Uhhhh, a lot of Infrastructure/Systems guys are doing the IaC and helping devs integrate things. The job is definitely not dying. Tons of troubleshooting to do. There’s not a large number of those guys compared to SWEs though. Both our Infra guys are kept pretty damn busy. If you noticed, there’s already only a couple Infra/Systems guys in an IT dept as it is. That’s not going to change. My department has 3 and then the number of devs we have is like 40. AI will trim the number of SWEs for many organizations, if it hasn’t already, NOT as dramatically as Infra was by virtualization and IaC, but there’s no lower level devs anymore in my org. Just mid to senior. Who knows, my org may be able to do the work of the 40 SWEs with 25-30 in a few years, there will still be 3 Infra guys though.To add, most companies are not full on automation either. There are still many several traditional companies that don’t have a need for IaC like larger companies. This will also be downvoted, but a lot of SWEs really can’t do Infra work….. I’m just being honest. There’s a lot more than standing up servers, app services, etc. They’re definitely safe lmao.",

Most of it was as a developer at a boutique consulting firm, and I stuck with the same client for about 3 years, a large at home healthcare company. Then bounced around other clients for a little over a year before we had a bad quarter and a headcount reduction. I got another job within the month building business software at a major auto manufacturer. All that said, here's something I wish I knew 5 years ago. The technical stuff, coding, architecture, deployments, are NOT the toughest part of the job. There's a good chance that coding is the easiest part of your work. It's working with and meeting the often inconsistent expectations of clients, product managers, stakeholders, and business analysts that will make your job hard. But, the good thing about that, is the better you learn to understand these people's perspectives and speak their language instead of nerd gibberish, you will be so much more valuable to your team. It's one thing to be a good coder, but when you're a good coder who can get the non-technical decision makers on your side, you become the person who GETS THINGS DONE. I inherited my current position from someone who was a good developer, but a really poor communicator. He didn't set expectations and just said whatever he needed to so people would stop asking him to explain. He developed a notorious reputation in the other departments as someone who didn't make sense and couldn't deliver. The tough part was he actually was a good developer, but people who didn't trust him tried to get in his way. Long story short, even though you're a developer, educate yourself in the business as a whole. Ask people from other departments about what they do and what their pain points are. Take their perspectives into account when it's appropriate and let them know that you're doing that (in a humble way, of course). You'll be an asset to the company as a whole and unique opportunities may open up.",

If you don't know something, anything that you don't know how to do/don't get/understand, ask for help. Do a bit of research first but do not spend more than an hour. If you are clueless on something even after an hour, just ask for help\\- When you have learned something new, take notes on it\\- Work on challenging tickets. It's the best way to learn things quickly\\- If you are working with a tech stack/tools you are not familiar with/you are new to it, work on a project that uses the tech stack/tools\\- Before you do something like make a PR for instance, ask what the company's convention/process is. Sometimes they may want you to write a PR in a certain way as an example. This goes for documentation, git commits, code as well. Pretty much anything where you need to do something for the company\\- Don't focus so much on documenting things when you are working on a ticket. Document for you, not for the company. But if the senior dev asks you to document something, then document. E.g., say you are working on something new, don't spend so much time neatly documenting an activity diagram or a sequence diagram. Focus on the dev work. If the company wants you to create a documentation, then document it. Not all documentation are useful for the company\\- Don't share anything personal/personal life issues. Colleagues may form negative opinions about you. This is like fitting into the company politics, if you don't fit, then you may be seen undesirable from a social point of view. Just keep it positive and professional\\- Company may have certain events or even activities like weekly soccer or board games. They may even have an internal committee where they are responsible for holding team related events/activities. Join them to maintain and improve relationships with the people in your company\\- At least when I did my internship, they valued efficiency. If you can complete work quickly and if you are able to take on work quickly, you will be seen as a highly valuable employee, you will get promoted easilyThat's all I can think of right now, I may add more if I can think of anything else.",

This however is against your \"want to keeps\" which is PTO and overall stability. I would interview and see what the process is like, but at the end of the day you do not have to sign an offer. Maybe the work is interesting or the contract is better than you think? No harm in \"wasting some time\" on the interview process and essentially practicing for future interviews as well.",

It also allows them to make sure you’re a good fit before just dumping 50k on someone who may not work out.",

No one here will be able to help out much except pointing out that these positions do not always convert despite what the recruiter may tell you. They just want someone to fill the position, so they can make money. There are people who have posted here complaining about lack of conversion and other stories about being lied to. I was lied to about the status of a contract renewal, so there was about 2 months or so the entire account could have been lost.The other thing, if I'm reading your summary correctly, is you only have an interview lined up.

You have that half in spades, you definitely are working hard and maybe a bit too hard (5000 applications in 8 months is nuts, thats close to 160 applications daily without any breaks). The other half is working smart. When you are looking for a job, you are selling your particular skillset to the company. Do you reflect on the applications that you do send in or do you just mass apply? How are you proving to the companies that you are sending these applications that you are indeed the best candidate?I am not saying that all of this is your fault either, the job market is fucked, but you don't control the market and neither do I, I am simply saying the things that are in your control which should be the primary focus.For the masters question, do you think it will lower your chances, raise your chances, or keep them the same? That is how I would make my decision. If you answer that you don't know then you should be asking yourself questions to find out. For example, if you are looking to hire a software engineer and you see 2 resumes that are identical except for the education section where one has a masters degree in computer science listed and one that has a boot camp degree that is listed, which one would you personally choose? Imo the answer is pretty clear there.You have to remember I don't know you though, don't take what I am saying personally. I could go the route of telling you how unfair everything is and how I feel bad for you but that doesn't solve anything in relation to you having a job so I tried my best to instead challenge your process since its the only thing you control.",

Surprisingly, my job applications are performing worse now on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed than they did back when I was still in high school and only knew basic Python, plus a bit of JavaScript and Java.People often suggest networking, and while that advice holds some truth, it's a double-edged sword in a metropolitan area. On one hand, there are more people and potential connections. On the other hand, interactions tend to feel impersonal and transactional. Stories like mine aren’t uncommon. Many peers I know have moved to places like Texas, California, or Florida in search of better opportunities.Even my career center and professors, many of whom have extensive industry experience, are surprised I haven’t landed something yet. I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging, but it really speaks to how tough the job market is right now, especially in a place like NYC.That said, I wouldn’t say you’re out of luck, especially if you’re in a close-knit suburban area where networking feels more genuine. In many ways, that can be an advantage over the more isolated experience of job hunting in a big city.",

The tradeoff here is that for above pay band talent, you need to invest in training them, or at least hire someone who can self-onboard.* Offer the use of technology, like Rust, or Haskell, or anything else, that people will pay a passion tax for. I'm not sure if Electron is this, and this is more a decision that needed to have been made when picking out the tech stack.* Offer responsibilities and ownership far above what the level of talent you are looking for would otherwise get. A decent mid or junior can make bank and work for a company where they are insulated from all decision makingI work at a big tech company, but pound for pound, the best dev team I've ever been on was at a Haskell start up: nearly everyone was a career changer, and loved Haskell. That love of the language was a requirement, and we got some really awesome people.What's also important to consider, is that you are making an offer to the market, and the simplest way this problem is solved is just more money.",

At ten percent occupancy they were bleeding enough money on rent to hire a new person for every one regularly in the office and they'd just signed an extended lease.My current employer would have a hard time enforcing RTO since they just let a lease run out and replaced the site with one with about 10% of the previous capacity.",

Managers should be the ones handling this. It should be understood that good performance at a team level means more flexibility because what you're doing is clearly working.Moreover, if it leads to people just trying to \"get their X hours\" before leaving then it discourages going outside for walks, coffee chats, lunch etc which is healthier than staying stuck inside like a prisoner.Frankly senior management should just be reasonable, which is basically impossible for most of them.",

Maybe SQL made sense at the time but the table just kept growing and now it's incredibly messy.The worst thing for me was studying system design stuff and you get references to Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. etc. as examples of tools to solve a problem. The question is that if you never used these, you have no clue on how it works.If at your job you use AWS, then try to solve these problems (or realize the shortcomings) with some tools that AWS provides (DynamoDb, SQS, etc). Then you can learn why Dynamodb might be a better option over Redis or something, even if you've never used Redis.If you are not currently employed and are still a new grad looking for an entry position - usually system design isn't a part of the interview process because it's hard without on-field experience.",

One thing that might help is to start by reading up on some basic concepts like scaling, latency, and capacity planning. GeeksforGeeks has some great articles on these topics that can give you a solid foundation.Also, try watching some system design interview prep videos on YouTube (e.g., System Design Primer or Cracking the Coding Interview). They cover a lot of the same ground as LeetCode problems but in a more theoretical sense. As for actual practice, start by trying to design a simple system like a blog comment section or a user authentication system - it'll help you get your feet wet with thinking through scalability and performance.If you want to dive deeper, I've used an AI tool that listens to system design interview questions and suggests responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Keep at it, and don't worry if it takes a few weeks or even months to get the hang of it - the more you practice, the better you'll understand these concepts!",

Rewrite the last two jobs paragraphs to showcase more of your deliveries and accomplishments for the business, less so the mentoring and support part. Your ecommerce founder experience is good to see, despite being not very applicable to the software engineering niche, it just shows that you have held a reasonable corporate job before.2.

One thing I learned is that companies often like to avoid former entrepreneurs, they see them as flight risks or otherwise as \"bad fits\". Then add a bit of ageism into the mix to make it nastier.Without crossing ethical or legal boundaries, I wonder if you could somehow rephrase \"Founder\" into something that sounds closer to a cog-in-the-machine role, such as \"E-commerce Technologist\".Maybe someone with more direct experience in CS can comment on this point, but anecdotally I've seen former founders/entrepreneurs experiment with this tactic and they did see results. I'm in the U.S, so there may be cultural or systemic differences to consider as well.",

If you just picked one major and then took some courses in the other, it'd be pretty much equally valuable.A master's degree will carry more weight. That'd be the better of the two options.Honestly, if you just want to maximize your chances of getting a job:1. Pick one major and do it really well. CS is ideal, but Data Science is totally fine.2. Do projects, go beyond what's required in class. Be curious. Try to really understand things.3. Apply for internships every summer. Do everything you can to get an internship. Use your career center, reach out to alums who graduated from your school recently, make friends with pros via open-source projects.Ultimately those things matter more than a double-major or master's.Do the master's if you really want to learn some of the material that goes beyond undergraduate CS or DS, and you really want to learn it in an academic environment. Don't do it expecting an easier time finding a job or a higher salary, it won't help. However, it might be worth it if the subfield you want to go into is really advanced.",

        "body": "I appreciate this perspective. It's easy for me to feel beholden to my work based on minimal benefits, and a lot of that comes from being a minimum wage worker within the last 5 years so I'm still not used to any form of benefits. My boss really is pushing for newer technology, but it's slow going. With this in mind I'm thinking of relaxing into the role a bit but focusing on the newer tech learning primarily. If things don't seem to be moving forward and improving over the next few years that may be my sign to move on, but I do like the people I work with and the company is very enthusiastic about any engagement. Just asking for learning materials seemed to be viewed very positively, and dedication looks to be well rewarded here. It seems like poor management has led to stagnation, and the team is all fairly new to working on this specific project so there's absolutely room to grow. It was mostly getting on my nerves yesterday and with some time to reconsider, you're right: steady pay is good. Thank you again for this perspective!",
