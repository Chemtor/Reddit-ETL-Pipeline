So i took the course as starting point. After attending and connecting with people I realised that the course is severely lacking. In my week 1 post someone recommended this [ease with data youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2IsFZBGM_IHCl9zhRVC1EXTomkEp_1zm) which turned out be a lot better one.So this is the one i depended to learn pyspark.I canceled subscription and filed for a refund.",

We thought SQLMesh might be that thing, but now I'm leaning towards something like [Kedro+Ibis](https://kedro.org/blog/building-scalable-data-pipelines-with-kedro-and-ibis)\\+[BSL](https://juhache.substack.com/p/the-boring-semantic-layer), and/or higher level abstraction that can be AI-native, with built-in best practices.I'm confident in the future of open source data transformations because of two things:1. **Existing users are fine.** If and when Fivetran tries to monetize dbt to the detriment of its users, the community will almost certainly **fork** dbt-core to maintain its openness (gratis+libre) for the longterm. However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.I've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that \"transformations as code\" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.The future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.There will be more and better solutions on the horizon. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:",

Under the hood we have configuration that samples x% of the dataset in question - profiles and reports the errors and offers one click fix - and ingest it in a staging layer. Beyond that you could add custom validators as long as they adhere to simple contract and add that in configurations.

Reduces redundancy: Redundancy is when the same information is stored multiple times, and a good way of avoiding this is by splitting data into smaller tables.> 1. Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.> 1. Minimizes **update anomalies**: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.> 1. Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.Anyway, I'll encourage you to skim their section about \"update anomalies\" and focus on the examples.",

First, it's a bank. Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.Second, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.Having to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.That said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place. They really are doing shit no other bank can. There are very good teams doing interesting work and very toxic teams where you will get fucked.Just like life it's a mixed bag. They pay well and if you aren't a coward you can learn a lot from those few awesome engineers holding down the fort. Take the money ride the wave and see where it takes you.",

They do attempt to see what tech companies do for software engineering best practices like Meta Google and Spotify and they try to do some of it. They also try to do some enterprise level bullshit from time to time that seems to waste thousands of hours of engineering time, as others have noted. So it can be hit or miss but there’s a solid chance it can be a good data engineering experience and it has solid pay.The culture isn’t that bad.

I have regular flare-ups of imposter syndrome, but have come to realize this usually happens under high negative pressure from unrealistic deadlines, poisonous office politics, or when I’m simply ill or haven’t been sleeping enough. The good days by far offset the bad ones, and I’ll realize that there are plenty of essential skills and experience that I bring to the table that typical CS profiles bring less of: e.g. engineers tend to ‘tunnel’ into technical problem solving and often struggle to zoom out and grasp the broader domain context. I have experience in multiple business process domains and in financial management, which in turn drives (executive) decision making. If you don’t grasp that, you can design fantastic technical solutions, but won’t ever get top down support to fund and execute against them.So, we can all learn from each other and together we create success. In my spare time I dig into my team’s code and do engineering training/certifications to learn more about that space and better lead my teams by asking better questions. I cannot judge whether you’re too far out of your depth in your current role, or whether you’re simply suffering the discomfort that actually indicates that you’re in the ‘learning zone’. That’s up to you to figure out. Just don’t be afraid to fail and don’t walk away out of fear. And take care of your physical and mental health while you’re working on your professional growth. You’ll come out stronger. Good luck!!",

That includes:× High-throughput ingestion (1.8M+ records/sec via MessagePack binary protocol) × Schema inference & evolution for time-series data× Automatic Parquet partitioning by measurement/hour × S3-compatible storage management (MinIO or AWS S3) × Query caching and REST API layer built inUnlike most DuckDB-based tools, Arc separates compute from storage, (but we really do that) the database layer can scale independently while storing data economically in S3 or MinIO. That makes it possible to handle massive historical datasets without expensive SSD clusters or rebalancing.From a performance standpoint, we’ve benchmarked Arc using ClickBench, the industry-standard analytical test suite.On identical hardware (AWS c6a.4xlarge), Arc outperforms TimescaleDB and InfluxDB by a wide margin.Without cache: Arc ranks #8 out of 60+ systems.With cache: it climbs to #3 overall, just behind DuckDB and ClickHouse.Benchmarks and details here: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-), here too: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results)In short, DuckDB gives Arc its analytics speed, but Arc extends that into a scalable, long-term time-series warehouse that can economically retain and query billions of records using Parquet and object storage.",

I actually dug a bit into Delta Lake and SeaweedFS after your comment, both are super interesting projects.From what I see, Delta Lake (or delta-rs) is more data-lake oriented, strong on ACID transactions, schema evolution, and batch updates. Arc’s focus is a bit different: it’s built for continuous ingestion and fast time-based queries, where writes are append-only and most performance comes from how data is partitioned and scanned, not from transactional updates.Right now, MinIO is the default because it’s stable, simple, and S3-compatible, which makes it easy to run Arc anywhere (local, on-prem, or cloud).That said, we’re still very early in the journey, and the storage layer isn’t locked in stone, we’ll definitely explore other options if they offer better trade-offs in performance or availability. Thanks for the SeaweedFS suggestion, we’ll plan to run some tests and look into supporting it as a storage backend.",

There was an independent devops team who could’ve helped us with infra but they washed their hands of my team and forced us to use clickops since they controlled the infra repos and AWS credentials. 3) Current job is very tech heavy, great engineering culture. We manage the whole stack infra, orchestration, all the way to gold layer end to end and deliver user facing products with analytics. Stack is Terraform, Airflow, dbt + Python, Snowflake, Fivetran/Airbyte. We write everything and every engineer knows their stuff. Team is only seniors though everyone has 7+ YOE.",

Especially with duckdb, SQL is the most portable and widely understood dialect for data transformations. And while Ibis mainly runs inside the Python session (or PySpark, Snowflake, a Python connection to a cloud database, etc.), SQL can run in native database SQL editors or SQL engines or even in R (via duckdb). That gives a huge advantage to SQL in my opinion.(2) Ibis must be crazy difficult to maintain given that it interfaces with so many different engines, that’s gotta be something to consider when writing code that you want to be performant 15 years from now. Is Ibis going to be maintained, will it receive regular updates as the underlying technologies themselves also change?That said I do think Ibis is situationally a great solution as you said.",

The way you have rewritten it causes two extra full table scans & aggregations rather than the specified exists / not exists. [Working from the docs PDF page 64](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.2.pdf): AND EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM lineitem l2 WHERE l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey AND l2.l_suppkey l1.l_suppkey ) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM lineitem l3 WHERE l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey AND l3.l_suppkey l1.l_suppkey AND l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate )You use an approach which scans and aggregates all orders then conducts a set comparison: AND l1.l_orderkey IN ( SELECT l_orderkey FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_orderkey HAVING COUNT(l_suppkey) > 1 ) AND l1.l_orderkey NOT IN ( SELECT l_orderkey FROM lineitem WHERE l_receiptdate > l_commitdate GROUP BY l_orderkey HAVING COUNT(l_suppkey) > 1 )The second is that there exists no other supplier who delayed the order. In CH you can't refer to parts outside the subquery, but you can achieve the same result by re-ordering the logic slightly without a full table scan & aggregation: WITH base AS ( SELECT li1.l_orderkey AS \"o_key\", sup.s_name AS \"s_name\", COUNT(1) AS \"line_count\" FROM supplier AS sup JOIN lineitem AS li1 ON li1.l_suppkey = sup.s_suppkey JOIN orders AS odr ON odr.o_orderkey = li1.l_orderkey JOIN nation AS nat ON nat.n_nationkey = sup.s_nationkey ANY JOIN lineitem AS li2 -- Other suppliers were present ON li2.l_orderkey = li1.l_orderkey AND li2.l_suppkey != li1.l_suppkey WHERE odr.o_orderstatus = 'F' AND li1.l_receiptdate > li1.l_commitdate -- The supplier delivered late AND nat.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' -- Specified by benchmark GROUP BY li1.l_orderkey, sup.s_name ) , sole AS ( SELECT o_key FROM base GROUP BY o_key HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT s_name) = 1 ) SELECT base.s_name, SUM(base.line_count) AS \"numwait\" -- Appears to be what the original benchmark is after FROM base JOIN sole ON sole.o_key = base.o_key -- Assert only this supplier caused delays GROUP BY base.s_name ORDER BY SUM(base.line_count) DESC, sup.s_nameIn general, explore the range of different joins such as [any join](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-fully-supports-joins-part1#left--right--inner-any-join) and [anti join](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-fully-supports-joins-part1#left--right-anti-join) which Clickhouse has and be careful translating exists / not exists from the benchmark spec. If you see wildly different results like this it's usually down to an implementation detail.",

If you want to sell yourself as a consultant, make sure you have the experience to know what you're doing. Then all other questions (how to do it, how to scale, how much will it cost) solve themselves.If you don't have the experience and you want to learn at the cost of the client, make sure to tell them upfront. Otherwise you're building something that won't fit their needs, and that won't be able to adapt to their future needs. Something like this wouldn't sell, even if it's free.I would recommend joining an established data team as an junior employee or consultant for 2 to 5 years, until you've mastered one niche in the field.

Practical path: have the client create a GCP project and add you as a temporary role; move the Looker Studio report and data sources to their accounts and re-auth. Land each CSV into a raw BigQuery table, then build a small star schema with scheduled queries; for repeatable transforms, run dbt Core on Cloud Run triggered by Cloud Scheduler. Keep costs tiny by using on-demand pricing, turning off BI Engine, setting maximum bytes billed in every query/source, and materializing small summary tables for Looker Studio. For speed, use Extract Data in Looker Studio on top of your fact tables. For handoff/sell: include a cost dashboard, a runbook (schemas, schedules, service account permissions), version-controlled SQL in a client-owned repo, and a light maintenance retainer. I’ve paired dbt Core and Airbyte for ETL, with DreamFactory when I needed a quick secure REST API layer for Apps Script or external tools. Bottom line: client-owned GCP, BigQuery with cost guards, and precomputed models over Sheets hacks.",

We also ran into heavy S3 throttling due to the number of parallel requests so that is something you will have to be mindful of.

Is that correct?",

I personally don't like having them unnested automatically, because sometimes the tables have too many arrays / dicts, and unnesting all of them creates a lot of tables. I like to control the fields, so if there is a need for unnesting, I like to do it myself. If a column will never be used, it doesn't make sense to unnest it at all.Another reason I dislike it is that, in modern DWHs, you can store JSON, as well as arrays/structs. So if you can store an array in a table, why should you unnest it? Keeping them as is gives you more power than splitting them into different tables.",

If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. That being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.If you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it. regarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",

Since dbt is in Python.. didn't quite know why it had to jump over to an adapter to do the Python models, but I went and submitted a issue on the Microsoft adapter github page to see if they could add that. One of my layers was to have some intelligent data cleansing and the Python models helped a ton with that idea. Another idea was to start sending some specific models out to an API, drop a CSV file into a shared folder, or throw some highly processed models at the top, all as part of the morning run. Legit use cases that could be then just sync'd up in dbt. Their response was, \"No. We will never do Python models. We do databases only.\" :enraged_face:",

That's why, after decades of doing data engineering, we released an open-source tool that does it for themOur goal is to help data teams automatically generate 80% of the data tests they need with just a few clicks, while offering a nice UI for collaborating on the remaining 20% the tests unique to their organization.DataOps Data Quality TestGen enables the simple and fast generation and execution of data quality tests through data profiling, new dataset hygiene review, AI-generated data quality validation tests, ongoing testing of data refreshes, and continuous anomaly monitoring. It comes with a UI, DQ Scorecards, and online training too: https://info.datakitchen.io/install-dataops-data-quality-testgen-today",

That way ConnectorX will start multiple connections in parallel which speeds up the data retrieval, and your changes will be minimal. That's what Pyspark would do if you set the number of partitions and partition bounds yourself anyway.I don't think ADBC is compatible with your systems and could be worth a try too, but the parallesisation is not built-in so you'd have to write it yourself.",

Edit: I see that you say the MI has Admin permission in the Fabric workspace, so you should be covered there already. If the notebook and warehouse are in different workspaces, the MI will probably need at least Contributor in both workspaces. It doesn't need to have any permissions on the capacity.Perhaps the .synapsesql() just doesn't work when triggered by MI. This seems to be a related case: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Warehouse/Service-Principal-Getting-quot-HTTP-request-forbidden-quot-When/m-p/4832636As a workaround, you can write to a Lakehouse table (and, if you insist on using a Warehouse, you can use API to do a metadata sync of the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint and then load the data from the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint into the Warehouse using a T-SQL script/stored procedure).Re: Storage blob contributor. No, it should not be relevant here. Storage blob roles are Azure roles. In Fabric, the Workspace Contributor (or Member/Admin) is what matters.",

But they agree on Parquet, Deletion vectors, and I believe they've just aligned on geospatial data types too. So they're very similar and as a result, can be made interoperable. Should you prefer Iceberg or Delta Lake as your \"preferred\" catalog or open table format? Jury still seems to be out. But if you end up wanting to change your preferred format, or end up needing to speak multiple to interface with tools that only handle one, that's very doable these days thanks to tools like Apache XTable.See https://xtable.apache.org/. It can translate between Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi metadata, without needing to duplicate the data itself. Disclosure: my employer contributes to Apache XTable (and offers table format virtualization et cetera as part of Microsoft OneLake: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-iceberg-tables)Not trying to sell you anything here though - Apache XTable is OSS and thus free to run on-premise of course (except for the hardware itself and your time, of course). If you have e.g. S3 api compatible blob storage on premise, believe it's supported: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/how-toAlso has nice docs on integrating with various other catalogs: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/catalogs-index",

You can take a look at ready-made platforms or open-source tools to ingest data from all these different sources you need. * At this stage, the data would land in a place you control in a certain layout and structure at least.* In terms of formats, the answer would depend very heavily on the types of formats: * If you have machine-readable formats like JSON, CSV, Excel files, Parquet files, and whatnot, this just becomes an orchestration problem, throw a data pipeline tool on it and you are golden. * I presume that's not the only thing, since you give the PDF example. Parsing PDFs with varying schemas over time is a hell I don't wish my worst enemies to go through, so that's not easy. * I have recently played around with Mistral's OCR model to extract a bunch of invoice data and it worked flawlessly, tackled \\~95% of our incoming invoices. * This would still require you to build a data pipeline solution around this, where the underlying work would be done by an AI model that would extract the structured data. * Once you have the structured data out, you would store this data in a data warehouse or a data lake with a clear schema and structure.From this point onwards, you would have a:* Central lake where you store the raw files* A data warehouse / data lake where you store the extracted and structured dataThis would theoretically get you to a better place. Obviously, what I wrote above contains a huge list of assumptions, but hopefully it helps with the general idea.",

I also started logging structure patterns and using them as templates to detect format changes early. It’s still not perfect, but it reduced the constant rewriting.Out of curiosity, are your PDFs more like structured tables or messy text-based reports?

That way you end up with more clarity on which column goes to what. And optionally, you can prefix each column name with the role play if that works best for your reporting tool. For example: * dim_date_invoice_paid.date_key * dim_date_invoice_approved.date_keyor * dim_date_invoice_approved.invoice_paid_date_key * dim_date_invoice_approved.invoice_approved_date_key",

        "body": "Stand up a small metadata store now and drive everything off content hashes; it saves you from full re-ingestion. For each source object, canonicalize JSON (sorted keys) or extract PDF text, then compute a doc hash and per-chunk hash; skip unchanged docs and only re-embed chunks whose hash changed. Track docid, sourceurl, lastseenetag, dochash, embedmodel, embedversion, chunkid, chunkhash, qdrantid, status, and pagination watermarks. DynamoDB works well (GSIs on status/source + TTL for old versions), though Postgres is fine if you want richer queries. In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes. Airbyte and AWS Glue handled odd API pulls for us; DreamFactory helped when we had to auto-generate REST APIs from legacy DBs to keep ingestion consistent. Add the metadata DB early and rely on hashing/versioning so updates don’t blow up your pipeline.",

I’d lean to a separate overrides table keyed by the business key with columns overridevalue, overriddenat, overriddenby, reason; then finalvalue = COALESCE(overridevalue, sourcevalue). That lets you revoke, reapply, and report on overrides without touching the base record. If you keep it inline, make origvalue immutable, add updatedat/updatedby/reason, and guard the update path so file uploads can’t rewrite origvalue.Performance-wise, COALESCE on a nullable override column is cheap; just index the business key. Keep raw in bronze, compute final in silver, and document the rule. Fivetran and dbt handled this cleanly for me, and DreamFactory exposed a small CRUD API so ops could edit the override table safely.So yes, your approach works, just enforce immutability and plan for audits or use an overrides table.",

Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.The shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.If you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",

That's like potentially an hour each way or more if traffic is bad compared with like 20 minutes now, max? That longer commute would really be a negative for me. I absolutely hate commuting and losing time sitting in traffic.On the other hand, the new role sounds better, and I don't think you can count on internal promotion, like you said. Power BI should be a good pathway into some relevant skills like SQL querying. And there should be internal opportunities at the new gig, too. That isn't any real unique situation to have that option.I won't say either way though - the new job sounds better to me, but I would hate to be commuting so much. Maybe the hybrid makes up for it?

You are hired to deliver business value using data, do that. This will give you both credibility internally, as well as future buy-in for deeper technical decisions you'll make.In the mid-term, I think your intuition is correct: you'll want to move the data into an analytical database and do the processing there. This would allow you to ensure the data is in the right shape, is accurate, and is easy and cheap to query from Power BI. You'll probably need to be pragmatic there too, therefore a first step in that direction could be something that you can run locally. That would mean no risky business in terms of access control, would be a bit of manual work for you but wouldn't require additional buy-in from different teams. The middle database could also be a SQL Server instance if the company is a Microsoft shop, it doesn't have to be Databricks if it is not available just yet.In the longer term, you'll probably want to move towards whatever the rest of the organization is doing. In case they have ETL solutions, you'd probably integrate these new sources with those and make this data available within the boundaries of the organization.Long story short: it sounds like you are working in a political environment, if I were you I would try to balance the best practices with immediate value being delivered in order to gain further trust and also give your superiors more evidence that you are on top of this.",

As an example, Docker comes from the realm of virtualization- the technique of nesting one or more virtual machines inside of a bare metal hypervisor.  Virtualization comes from emulation- reading code made for one type of machine and converting it in real-time to run on the actual machine- Java is an example, being built on the \"Java Virtual Machine.\"Emulation actually has much older roots, though- it dates back to when mainframes were the most common way to get things done. It was common for mainframes to be used to emulate several early microcomputer for software development to test programs that were meant to be cross-compiled before Windows became dominant. And old programs made for older mainframes would sometimes be supported via emulation to allow businesses to upgrade their equipment as technology improved.This all comes down to one of the most important skills in programming: the ability to take one big problem, and break it down into smaller sub-problems that are easier to answer. When you go deep enough into a computer, you will see that the whole thing is basically the idea of a lightswitch, on or off, just repeated billions and trillions of times.",

        "body": "A system call is basically just a fancy kind of function call. The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.The kernel can \"receive\" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the \"list of running processes\" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to \"print\" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly. User code is normally forbidden from doing this by the CPU's memory protection hardware.",

The kernel doesn't have its own standard out, it wouldn't mean anything. And you can't make system calls anyway.

        "body": "Not bad advice certainly, but I would say that if there is a silver bullet it is being actually interested in it.It used to be that everybody was like this, because when I joined the industry at the very beginning of the first dotcom bubble, it was all just basically nerds. It paid well even then, but there wasn't even the notion of, \"anybody could do it\". The assumption, quietly, is that you were born with it or something.That wasn't true, but it was more true than we treat it today.Anybody can learn how to write software. It's not even really that hard. It takes time but it is only hard in the sense of \"learning a foreign language\" is hard, not in the sense of, \"winning gold at the olympics\" is hard. Put enough time in, and you'll get there.What some people are \\*born\\* with I think, is the kind of mind that finds this stuff compellingly interesting. Not everybody working on open source is doing it so they can put something on their CV. Most aren't. Most just enjoy solving the problem.In 2025, I have now started to advise people that if this is not you, if you don't actually have this interest and are instead just looking for comfortable, well-paid employment, think carefully. This would have been a great move in 2005, and a pretty good one in 2015. In 2025, I think it's probably a mistake.I don't think it is the end of the profession, but the golden age, sadly is closing on us. Software is a lot of people's 'default bet' for something to do with their lives that might give them a comfortable existence when they don't know what else to do. Frankly, sitting where I am today, I would not want to be those people starting out right now.",

Future you will thank past you for practicing every little concept. Rather than skipping, procrastinating, \"eh I don't get it but screw it, I'll come back later\", etc. The more you learn, the more you will realize there is so much you don't know. But also, the more you learn, the more exciting it will be. Take it step by step. TAKE EVERYTHING STEP BY STEP IN LIFE.

So I think the authors’ goal is not to teach strictly Python, but to teach general programming concepts.At a conceptual level, most programming languages are all the same. They might differ on little stuff like brackets and indentation, or on big stuff like type safety and compilation, but at a high level they all expose the exact same tools to the programmer, like loops, conditionals, functions and collections.So by playing a game where you solve problems with code, you’re still effectively learning to program. Once you understand these concepts - once your brain “thinks in code” - it’s easy to transfer those skills to another language and another syntax, whether it’s Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, C++, whatever. The syntax can be googled, but the concepts stay the same.",

The situation is basically you don't know where to start, what to do, how to get to the next level, etc. Granted, this will be slightly biased as I do full-stack + devops and own a fledgling software company. In other words, I am very product-oriented.Think of a product that you actually want to exist in the real world. It's okay if the thing you want to build happens to be in existence already, just don't make \"clones\" of things that already exist. Like don't go make a Twitter clone because you'll get bored before you can solve the fun problems and there are about a thousand videos showing you every step of solving said problems. Not fun, not unique, not impressive, not engaging in my opinion.That being said, there's nothing wrong with going forward with your own social media idea and forging your own path. I would even encourage you to do so if that's what you are interested in. And you can take inspiration from how existing products handle certain problems. That's a common practice. Copy the high-performers. Aggregate existing solutions from difference sources to create a new output.The real gains are when you see a gap in the real world that technology can fill and then you capitalize on it. No good app to do some random thing that would be really cool if it existed? Build that app. Deploy it. Tell people about it. Maybe they will use it. Improve said app based on feedback. Maybe they will tell their friends. Next thing you know you have learned a world of information and built skills you didn't know existed.That's how I stayed engaged. Not the path for everyone.",

Here's how you should think about it: **The snake is a queue**!Everytime it moves, a new position is added to one end of the queue (that is the head) and the last position in the queue is removed from the queue (that is the end of the tail). Except when eating something, the tail is not removed. So you don't change the position of the head, you \"add\" a new head in front of the snake, depending on the direction it is moving.Use an actual Queue data structure if you can - that makes everything easier. And if not, then at least abstract the queue for the snake-body, so you don't have to worry about the array-index of head and or tail when building the game.Hope that helps - good luck with coding it now!",

It was fun to think about how to solve the problem, what kinds of things I'd want the app to do, and then write it. We decided that we'd have a web interface for adding/deleting items, and then QR-codes embedded in the box labels so my wife could point her phone at a box and \"see\" the contents.My daughter, a comp-sci sophomore at the local university, helped me code and debug it, which was also a really fun father/daughter experience. We're currently in the middle of adding the 40 or so boxes from our storage room to the inventory. When we're done, we'll be able to find stuff (Funny story, while opening boxes to add items to the app, we've discovered stuff we'd forgotten we had).I work in tech, but I am not a programmer.

Why are there 3 layers of indirection? Wat is this ;-; ?? \". The gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how \"professional\" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \\*work\\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. 1. Read the classics. Reading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns. Stuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \\*right now\\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.2. Rewrite your own old code. Grab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your \"thinking level\" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.3. Try contributing to large OSS projects. Tips: \\- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate. \\- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability. \\- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable. The feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \\*key\\*.**TL;DR:** Real-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug . Read literature to get the theory, revisit (and refactor) your own old code and see your growth, study bit open-source projects. Also, communication matters more than people admit.",

I got paid for almost 5 years to write software after getting a CS degree, but didn't have guidance from seasoned industry pros. When I finally did join a team of such people, I learned a tremendous amount that I never learned from books.The top things I remember learning were:1. Evaluate your toolchain periodically, using a good IDE, updated compiler versions, linters, static analysis, continuous integration, etc. and treat compiler warnings as hard errors.2. Production code has what will probably look to you like an insane amount of error-handling code and error/debug logging. It's there for a reason. Amateurs like my former self are satisfied letting an app crash with a cryptic message.3. Similarly, an apparently huge quantity of unit test code. Former me was focused on \"getting the code to work\", but if it only works for the happy-path cases, that's not nearly good enough.4. Once it's working and tested, resist the urge to go changing things willy-nilly. When you change something, anything at all, you run the risk of introducing errors. Don't change things unless you have a good reason.5. If you observe something about your code that you don't understand, any kind of unexplained behavior... don't stop working until you DO understand it. It's very often an error lurking. Don't ignore it.There's lots more. Again, you learn best by working with professionals and shipping software to real users.",

Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as \"objects\" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is \"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout. Hope you found this comment helpful.",

Those of us who are ESL will very likely speak with an accent but can still be very capable at English, and without mixing languages all the time (if anything the contamination seems to go more the other way when younger people with a smaller vocabulary are overexposed to anglophone memes).Significant semantic differences like that of string mutability should become reflexive over time, though you may also find that your expectations gravitate towards the strictest among the languages you usually use, as you don't get errors for being more conservative than you strictly need to be.There are some things that are more trivial differences that I think you'll just have to live with though, like whether it's `s.trim()` or `s.strip()`, or `len(xs)` vs `xs.len()`. For those you basically just have to have a language server or some other step to catch your goofs. You'll be able to fix it immediately as soon as you get the feedback because you ultimately know the semantics you want and you do know both variants, but made a mistake on the level of a spelling mistake. (And of course it's possible to stumble into spelling mistakes that result in valid grammar with different semantics, just like in human languages.)So I expect that I'll get the case right for `bool`/`Bool` because I can remember that convention for a given language, but I _will_ mix up whether or not it ends with `-ean` because that's not really something I can reason my way into.",

Then they built software to correlate that with satellite and aerial images.However, only so much could be automated. So they hired thousands and thousands of contractors to put everything together.

Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. Of course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent. Anyways, that’s my quick intro, and each of those areas could be greatly expanded upon.",

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is \"orthophotomap\". They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. Web servers spit out those images as \"tiles\". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless. If you watch your map app you can see it retrieving and displaying tile-by-tile.You can see, especially in more remote areas, the swaths of imagery. Maybe one swath was taken in the spring, and another in the fall. So they look a bit different.The features, I think Google has their own streets-and-borders-and-rivers data. OpenStreetMap.org has a crowdsourced and quite excellent freely available database like that. With nice APIs. Good good stuff. You could make a very interesting student project with it if you wanted to.I once worked at a map-making company that got hired to make a super high rez orthophotomap of O'Hare International Airport near Chicago. Our pilot got an earful from Air Traffic Control when he tried to get them to let him do his job flying back and forth over the field at 600ft above ground level. He had to get the top airport executive and some ATC honcho to go together up to the tower and personally tell the controllers to cooperate. No visible swaths in that job!",

There's no reason for OOP other than to make it easier for humans to work with code.In my opinion, the most useful purpose of OOP is to let you establish rules, so that somebody working with your code can't accidentally use it wrong.That's why it's so popular at large companies. Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.Similarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.Without OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.Sometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself! Even if you're the only one working on a program, OOP provides a way to organize it and help keep you from accidentally using your own code the wrong way.",

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of \"objects\"; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like \"hungry\", \"happy\" or \"dead\". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; \"encapsulation\" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), \"inheritance\" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and \"polymorphism\" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",

An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.",

        "body": "I assume you are in University for CS or something related? Focus on your classes and the things available to you at uni and less on self studying random books. Sign up for courses that both teach you something fundamental and make you implement things. Operating systems is a perfect example. You will learn a lot about how computers work from a low level and it will include writing and reading code. Other examples could be networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, or computer graphics. Basically any class where your homework is largely writing code. Many classes could fall into this category or not depending on how they're taught. For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.This is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.If you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project. If you are stuck, go to office hours and ask for help. Take advantage of the resources and expertise available to you. Professors have connections in industry, if you stand out they can help you or they might even employ you directly",

The target address is the start of the function that should be called.And still before that, the parent function saves it's current instruction position somewhere on the stack (in a specific defined location, not just anywhere).

For example, you save the order to the order database but you have an error when writing to the delivery database. The error handling in this kind of setup is pretty ugly.If you use a single database, you start a transaction, insert into all different tables, and at the end, you commit the transaction to the database. This ensures that either all or none of the table updates get processed.This is part of the [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) properties that you want to have from a database management system. With a distributed system, achieving ACID is very difficult.",

For instance, customer information, doesn't care what restaurants exist, what drivers exist, what drivers are available, etc. So clearly Cx_Info is its own table. Driver information is useful to the customer front end, the restaurant portal potentially, HR/Finance, etc. So again, this should probably be its own table, and accessed largely via JOINs. The restaurant list doesn't care about customers, or drivers. Continue down the line. You'll end up with a bunch of tables, a bunch of JOINs that are needed to process orders, updated the client front-end, etc. but all will be logical. The one I'm stuck out on most right now, is if I'm using a classical SQL database, as opposed to some JSON based noSQL database structure. How do I want to handle individual restaurants menus?",

In this case, it's nice to be able to pull in just the external data definitions, and not the rest of the class.It's been a while, so I can't remember off the top of my head how this shows up when you hit a circular include, but keep it in mind as you start to add more features.",

It’s fine that you understand a little basics of a few languages, but now, go deep in one of them.",

They're not mutually exclusive.There are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.There are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the \"top\" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They \"lose\" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you. So if you just want to share and not create a business, then this is fine.",

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",

For example, with the **AddressAPI** project, it’s interesting to show how it helps reduce execution time, optimize processes, or solve specific issues.Speaking of development, a good README is one that clearly explains the system design, API design, how the project works, its purpose, and also how to run it properly, right?",

It’s very far away from web-dev, but the other day I had to throw together a simple dashboard for some telemetry we are collecting. Learning programming is a long journey, with many different paths to take. My opinion is that any kind of programming experience is good, even things that might seem unrelated on the surface.However, all the companies I’ve worked at (both small startups and large corporations, in Germany or the US) are only looking for candidates that have a masters or PhD in a relevant field.

Well no one is going to hire a backend dev for example with 0 years of experience and handle them critical data. So usually frontend is how you start or full stack in a large team and then you pivot to whatever you like more. Having said that no matter the role you apply, Being fullstack early in your career can separate you from the competition. If you compete for a frontend role and the other candidate has built some front end projects but you have built full stack end to end projects, you are ahead of them.",

It sadly happens, but not too often. The thing that does put me off quite often is when I get resumes from new graduates who decide to rate themselves out of 5 for each of their skills and put 5/5 for most of them. That's funny to me. I've been writing Java code professionally since 1999 and if I was feeling particularly confident I \\*might\\* give myself a 4. There are certainly people better than I am. Don't do that. The interviewer, if they know what is good for them, and also good for you, will be thinking not, \"can this person already do the job?\", but rather, \"is this somebody I think I could train?\". This means trying to be as solid as you can in the basics, admit the stuff you don't know, and ask them questions that make it clear that you understand that they know more than you, and you are interested in learning from them.

        "body": "Not to discourage you, but getting a junior position is much harder these days, especially for a self-learner as opposed to someone with a degree.Yes, if you learn those things, you could probably do the work in a jr web dev position, but getting the job is the hard part. You are competing with people(new grads) who have degrees with equally or better portfolios and possibly internship/CO-OP experience. These people will also not only just know the languages/tech that you mentioned, but they would also know computer science fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, OOP, etc. Obviously, most new grads are not experts in these things, but I’m just giving an idea of what you’d probably be up against. Related to that, you would have to learn leetcode, which is most of the time, not extremely relevant to the job/position, but usually required to pass an interview.Yes you can learn all of those things yourself, but to add onto the issue of no degree, a lot of ATS résumé scanners used to look for candidates will immediately filter out people without degrees.So, most people will suggest that you get a degree if you are serious about getting a developer or adjacent position. Not only would you learn important computer science concepts, but it is a good chance for networking and will help you to land a job.Obviously, this is not guaranteed advice, as now, even new grads with internship experience are struggling to find jobs. Yes, you can get a job while self learning, but it is extremely difficult. So if you are serious about this, I would at least consider the idea of going to school, or try self learning first and see if this is something you want to pursue even.",

But use a curriculum. There are free ones like The Odin Project and Free Code Camp, and there are paid curriculums on sites like Udemy or Laracasts. Pick something that goes deep and don't stop until you're able to build amazing apps. Good luck to you.",

I think it would benefit you more to simply practice building web apps. Start by identifying what you're struggling with in particular, and then research and practice it deliberately.Also, if you're finding it hard to study and think you would study easier (or more) if you made a game, think again. The average game is no less difficult to make than the average web app. In fact, games are much more complicated on average, I would say, and the experience of developing a game is nothing like playing one.",

Find a beginner friendly book or course about basic consepts of programming and go through it. Know what? If you are aiming to master C++, your initial learning doesn’t even need to be in C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!Mister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.One good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time. This is a simple, little book, that kind of escalates sneakily. You can read it over and over again till you get everything.",

Kevlin Henney is another great lecturer to check out when it comes to code semantics and programming linguistics which can also lend a hand in your learning style.I would recommend beginning with compilers that you invoke via the CLI (g++ or clang, so maybe start on Linux or a Mac) instead of an IDE that compiles everything for you (such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.) This way you can learn how build systems work under the hood and get into makefiles and also expose yourself to valgrind (this is essential if you want to learn and do your due diligence in the craft.)Also, it would be helpful to learn some C if you haven't already. I recommend c99 for simplicity unless you want to see what threading is all about, then go with c11 or newer. Furthermore, have a very in-depth understanding of how compiled languages differ from interpreted languages (static vs. dynamic languages, respectively)I could go at length, and for some context, I typically point to prerequisites before the actual topic one wants to study. The foundations are too important to ignore, imo",

Sure you could read books and do your own projects but will you? Most people will not go nearly as in depth because we tend to be lazy and disorganized. Our bootcamp enforced attendance and had weekly challenges which were difficult enough to require several hours of time outside the class activities.Second our challenges and course material was carefully selected to reflect current industry demands. If you are watching YouTube videos you will likely get sucked into a small niche of data analytics rather than learning the general concepts. This paired with instructional staff who gave feedback, showed issues and helped refine your knowledge, lead to a good base.But aside from this the students who did well and actually got positions, which were more than I expected, were ones who continued polishing and building a portfolio. We got them running but the finish line often requires continued education. But you do build momentum and result in several potential portfolio projects so it is better.TLDR: Bootcamps provide structure and accountability that self learning rarely provides unless you are very organized and driven - but students often still needed to continue working on and polishing their portfolio to get their foot in the door.",

The questions he asked were almost always the first answers from a Google search, so him asking me those questions instead of trying Google first kind of wasted both of our time. If we were working together in person though I would have been more ok with it.Otherwise, my advice would be to try and read through the code to figure out solutions to tasks, but time box it.

To do that conversion, you have to convert each digit's character code to the corresponding numeric value, but you also have to multiply them by the corresponding powers of 10 and add them up. Even if the character-to-digit conversion was a no-op, it wouldn't really simplify the code much.The [Wikipedia article on ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) points out a specific reason for *not* doing this: if you want to be able to lexicographically sort strings in a human-friendly order, it's useful for the space character to have an earlier code than all other printable characters, and for separator characters (e.g. punctuation) to have earlier codes than non-separators. That already rules out using the earliest code (0) for the digit 0. And since you want the digits to have consecutive codes, it also rules out using codes 1-9 for the corresponding digits.",

This means that zero through nine were required to be placed in the code contiguously with the zero at a code point multiple of 16. That is one of code point 0, 16, 32, 48, and so on; they chose to situate zero at 0x30 (48) partly to make sure that special characters appeared before numbers and alphabetical characters in sorted order.Hope this helps.",

The 'A' at 41 and 'a' at 61 allow for upper and lower case conversion and testing to be simple bit operations. There's a few more hidden gems in there.It all comes down to bits.

Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.And the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really. You could argue that the conversion is still slightly simpler, but it isn't really significantly so, and it's hardly worth losing the benefits such as simpler and more performant sorting for characters.",

From a central EU and USA perspective: A degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. A computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to \"self learn\" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. A software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. In some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. Then you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) Certificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done. If you want to know where to start for self learning, there is a quite well written FAQ section in this subreddit (right hand side of your screen on PC, you will find it on mobile as well) with a list of places to start, very well laid out and explained",

You might find them boring and think you’ll never use them until you do. Certificates might hold some value, but their value perishes quickly as new tech emerges. If you have a PC, you can start learning directly b/c all the tools you’ll need are open source and thus freely available.",

I would work hard, study hard, and look into \"ENGINEERING\". A lot of math, but those careers are shining. Too many people are getting Computer Science Degrees and the companies are NOT hiring. Learn Artificial Intelligence (AI). Embrace it, because you will be exposed to in now or later. I love PYTHON - there are so many \"FREE\" resources to learn it. Program it every day. Make Projects (Digital Clocks, Password Generators, Automation Projects). They seem complicated until you try them. Also JAVASCRIPT (The language of the WEB) will help you make websites, which can be valuable. Try to be the brightest in your peer group, so people will come to you for answers.",

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.Stay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",

Focus on creating a minimal viable product (MVP), then iterate.

So you have many, many different options to choose from.Some of these frameworks run on the server side, by assembling an HTML document out of fragments and sending the entire resulting page to the browser. Others run on the client side using JavaScript, by dynamically assembling the page using DOM elements.As a very simple example, if all of the pieces you want to use are static content, you can use a web server that supports [Server Side Includes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes). This technology isn't used much nowadays, but it's relatively easy to understand.If you're writing a custom webapp backend, then you can use any server-side templating engine that you want. A template engine can allow one HTML fragment to include others, and it can also allow more dynamic substitutions. Many beginners use Python along with the lightweight Flask web framework, which uses the Jinja template engine.If you're dedicated to using Java, you can use servlets and JSP pages (kind of old school) or you can go with a more modern framework like Spring, which supports a variety of template engines.If you want to use client-side rendering with JavaScript, you once again have lots of options: React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, ...",

It's just that they wanted to make a product and there were constraints, so they made the best they could with them. Also, these examples are not proff of anything: > Resident evil used the doors for loading screens but that actually makes the game more tense. More tense *than what*? Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints? I know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations. In any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product. It can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative. The goal of these games is not to be products, even though some of them end up being great base ideas that later get expanded into full games.",

Perhaps if you are *very* used to learning this way, I know fully blind programmers. It’s not just the seeing, it’s the doing.

You won't get anything done? You'll place last? Your stuff does not work? Your stuff will be basic? But even that will be a position to gain new information from. You'll learn where are you and you'll learn what else you can improve in yourself. And at best, you get something done and do not land last in the ranking.And about memorizing stuff then computer sciences is not just about memorizing stuff but about that information into a practice. You sit in lectures -> try to do something practical after that and use that new knowledge. You learn a new technology -> start using that new technology. It is all about practicing what you are learning.You are worried about the AI. Who stops you from hopping on the AI train? Learn to use it (not learn to rely on it blindly). Free AI tools are there. It takes just few Youtube videos to see how to use one or another tool. You can allocate one weekend on learning to use an AI and already you'll know more and you'll be more experienced than prior to that weekend.Hopelessness will not change anything. Start taking real actions. Stop worrying about \"what if\"-s. Either you do things or you do not.",

I suppose I was thinking you had to memorize everything; couldn't check out books or take your notes home or something. So confused.Anyway, this one time, at band camp. Oh, wait, I wanted to mention tackling. I was playing football this one time, I received the kickoff and I was running at an angle to my left. This dude came flying at me, hit me on the right side and he fell down. I ran it back for a touchdown, when I turned to go back to the sideline, he was there. He asked me how I didn't go down. He was like, dude, I nailed you hard and you didn't budge. It was weird, it was this freak thing, like I was way stronger than him, but he was bigger than me. I figured he didn't know how to tackle, he didn't wrap me, or it was just the wrong angle, like how a spaceship can bounce off the atmosphere on re-entry. That's stuck with me a long time and you mentioning tackling similar issues brought back memories. I'll just say, I think the best thing to do when you're tackling in any situation is to make sure you wrap 'em around the legs. I wouldn't go high.",

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not. There is a cost to making that first function virtual and you might not want to pay it. If you have other virtual functions already then you probably should go ahead and make the destructor virtual.",

It was a lot of banging my head against multiple conceptual walls, until I broke through them, one by one. Every single concept I needed to apply a few times until it clicked in with the rest.And as far as I can tell, there is no shortcut to get through this. You will need to just spend more time on the basics. Starting with a game engine is more complicated, I suggest learning the basics of programming first.",

        "body": "So, there's a couple of different stages of learning.The first is like the raw syntax of a programming language. Like because we program in text, we can type a lot of letters that aren't valid code. For learning an instrument, I think an analogue is giving a child from a culture without manufactured instruments a saxophone and saying \"This makes music\" - it might take them a *long* time to learn how to make it make sound. They might just start off trying to bang on it or hit it with sticks! Once you learn the syntax of a programming language - what are valid \"words\" to use and roughly what they do, you're at the \"knows how to blow into the mouthpiece and where to put your fingers\" stage of learning.Alternately, you might look at that stage as writing sheet music for someone else to play. Because, really, it is the computer who is executing the tasks, you're just giving it instructions. Can you imagine learning how to write sheet music through trial and error and never being told how the symbols work? It'd be pretty hard. You need to learn the relationship between the symbols and actions and the result.But once you're past that stage, there's a long middle area where you're best off avoiding too much book learning and just try trial and error - learning to make the sounds you want, you know? You can go to reference materials when you're struggling, but you want to get to the point where you can make your instrument make any sound you want it to.After you've got that level of proficiency, being able to make any sound you want, then you move on to \"what sounds sound good?\", start to learn about musical genres, how to play with others, etc. That's when you're going to want to start reading a lot more and studying some theory, though there'll remain no substitute for practice.To abandon the music metaphor - I find it takes non-programmers about as long to become proficient in programming (getting through the first two stages and starting on the third) as it takes your average person to become fluent in a language not related to your native language (so as long as it'd take an English speaker to learn Russian or Chinese). Thankfully, all the subsequent learning after that comes *much* faster.Anyways, learning programming is an endeavour measured in *thousands of hours*, so don't get disheartened if it feels slow starting out.",

So, first, yes, those sorts of folks do tend towards C++ because the extra performance is often worth the cost in those competitions.I'd start with data structures and algorithms. You'll need basically all of them. Take classes, read articles, whatever, you need familiarity with many algorithms. Graph searches are going to be your bread and butter. After that, familiarity and practice is important. Working through old competition problems, reading other people's solutions, etc. Regular practice is #1. Beyond that, collaboration.

        "body": "Oh brother, lets break this down, and I'm going to explain this in a high level, so I don't have any Java-specific tips to give. Maybe just general ones.So in this 2 weeks, you would have to create:- mechanics (movement, AI/automatons, pass/fail conditions, etc.)- look (UI, aesthetics, animations, etc.)- other utils that can be optional (save/load system, settings system, the extra stuff that can help with accessibility)There can be more things here and there depending on complexity, but as a bare minimum, you would make all of these and combine them all together.You're now probably thinking \"oh boi this is a lot of work\" and I don't know how many you are in the team, so my first suggestion is to make it as simple as possible, and only add features if it's possible within the timeframe. Don't try to make too much features that just ends up delaying the release. We call that \"feature creep\". Write a TODO list and gauge the complexity of certain features or aspects so that your team can prioritize on ones that are critical. Don't try to deliver a car without an engine. That's what happened to my team in my game development course in university and we used Unity3D, which has less boilerplate setup than Java Swing (or at least, we don't code the UI from scratch), and we're given a longer time to make the game. Feature creep fucked us over.Next suggestion is learning git and GitHub. Host your project there, and you all can collaborate wherever you are and you can revert changes if stuff did not work right. Creating branches is useful so that everyone's works can be isolated. And you can do peer reviews. This helps with code quality and engages collaboration with each other.Last suggestion: always test. If possible, reserve a few days for playtesting and bugfixing after playtest. That's why we have alpha and beta tests. Alpha test is your whole team testing the game, and beta test is other people playing your game. This will give you a fresh perspective on people interacting with your game. Like as simple as a certain hitbox not working right. Or a critical bug that can happen when conditions are met that your whole team has not encountered in your internal playtesting.And that's it from me. I'm not a professional game developer by any means, and I'm not specialized in Java Swing or Java in general (although it's my main programming language), but my game development course and my current job gave me a lot of insight and workflows on how to tackle potentially large projects like these. And I've realized that the difficulty is not necessarily on the programming, but planning and managing the project altogether. So I guess the first step now is to setup all the things. GitHub, the initial Java project and needed external libraries. Then plan it all out, so that you can assign tasks to yourselves. Feel free to chat in DM. Just don't show weird sht or send a virus that destroys my PC.Oh right before I forget that this post exists, my other advice is to not make AI do your work. Sometimes, they're just doing random sht. Other times, it collides with something. AI relies on your foundation code to become a good asset (which can still screw up, but it may screw up less). So assuming you are allowed to use AI coding agents (because this question will come up at some point), always verify what it types out. Again, this is where peer reviews come into play. Either do it in school or via GitHub PRs.And NEVER EVER USE GENERATIVE AI FOR ANY CREATIVE ASSETS LIKE ART OR MUSIC. We have free assets to use on the Internet if you have to. Making any form of artistic work via Generative AI is a middle finger to artists that have spent hours and hours on making artworks that people appreciate, enjoy, or even connect with.",

        "body": "Programming is an extension of technology, or you can also think of it as a microcosm of technology. The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.At its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.For example, instead of writing: cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;You can instead write: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; }Classes serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you \"group\" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of \"code safety\" as well.But to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax \"oddities\" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. This is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",

In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. I.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer. But the C Standard (at least all C Standards before C23) only requires platforms to support from -2147483647 to 2147483647 in order to accomodate storing the integer in non 2's complement form. However it seems that C23 requires 2's complement, so maybe that is different in C23. In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. However, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at \"at compile time\" maybe it's really implementation defined). In any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).If you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",

Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.So I've played with it, and wrote the variations: int x = 5; int x = 5L; int x = 5LL; int x = 5ULL;And I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64. This is what I got: mov w0, 5 //ARM mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5 //x86_64The compiler didn't care what my literal was suffixed. The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.Now as for your code: printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);Yeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.---I think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.C defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types: int8_tEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.The fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.Then there are the `least` types: uint_least32_tEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.Use these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.Continued...",

        "body": "Finally, there are the `fast` types: int_fast16_tEtc. You should use these as function parameters, iterators, and locals. These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.C has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.Most of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.So the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.So this code: printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);It's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.---The other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.Your `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So: typedef struct weight weight; weight *create(int_least32_t); weight *dup(const weight *); weight *copy(weight *, const weight *); void destroy(weight *); weight *add(weight *, const weight *); weight *multiply(weight *, int); int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *); int print(const weight *);Notice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement: struct weight { int_least32_t value; }; weight *create(const int_least32_t value) { weight *w = NULL; if(value >= 0) { weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight)); w.value = value; } return w; } //... weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) { if(res && w) { res.value += w.value; return res; } return NULL; } weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) { if(res && v >= 0) { res.value *= v; return res; } return NULL; }",

This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.More on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)Also, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).So in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.If you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case: uint64_t tmp = 1ul; tmp <<= 48; uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp; printf(\"%zu\\n\", sizeof(value)); printf(\"%lu\\n\", value);This should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",

If you call `rand` without seeding it, it is the same as seeding the RNG with `srand(1)`.`rand` is the C API, and `rand` is generally regarded as one of the worst RNGs ever written. It has some of the poorest random characteristics - it won't cycle through the entire range of an `int`, and it will repeat itself very quickly. It's also not portable - ever C standard library implements it differently, so for the same seed, two different implementations will generate different sequences.C++ has the `` header in the standard library. It's kind of hot garbage. This is an example - C++ has many, of the standard committee taking something good and ruining it. There aren't many RNGs defined within it, you don't know the size of the initialization space for any of them - so you don't know how many bits of entropy is enough for sufficient randomness, and once again, every implementation is different, so the outcomes are not portable.The thing to do is use an independent portable library for reproducibility and consistency. Boost.Random is an excellent library, and the origins of what the standard committee fucked up. The problem with the standard library is once something goes in, it basically can never change, because C++ doesn't break backward compatibility. It's why we have `std::thread` and `std::jthread`, because `std::thread` is fundamentally flawed.",

They are happy with the offer as a junior at a FAANG may have a higher compensation than Staff at a mom and pop store.But as the market is very bad, now this is a thing all over the industry. A senior would prefer to work as a junior instead of being unemployed. And for companies it's a no brainer to hire a senior for the pay of a junior.",

There’s a huge gap between the skills companies actually need and the number of people already trained and looking for work. So you end up with fewer openings and way too many applicants, and let’s not even talk about how low the salaries companies are offering these days. It’s not just tech either, people are getting degrees in fields like anthropology or psychology, and unless they go all the way to a PhD, they’re stuck in an endless loop of not having enough experience. The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today’s needs.I think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you’d actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you’re interested in. Tell them your situation, ask if they know of any openings, and see if they’re willing to help or give some guidance. It’s not a guaranteed solution, but it really does increase your chances. If you’re open to remote work, check out [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/); it shares a simple but effective way to send your resume to hundreds of companies.And don’t forget, all the jobs you’ve done to get by still matter.

There is always room to grow in communicating up and down the chain, laterally amongst technical teams and non-technical teams, understanding how to shape your communication per audience.e.g. bullet point style delivery for uppers, empathy and encouragement for more junior technical staff while having clear expectations, getting into the weeds with your contemporaries but also being able to maintain moving towards an outcome or result as opposed to mental masturbation and bike shedding.Understanding business domain and product positioning for what is a desired feature or QoL improvement for end users. I have found I often had ideas that really enhanced an already planned feature because of being able to synthesize technical knowledge with domain knowledge as opposed to just being handed a checklist from business side.Balancing tradeoffs of delivering value and creating impact with best practices and engineering excellence. This is an entire sliding scale. Internal tools vs product features vs infra etc...But I mean, most enterprise or consumer software is likely just large scale CRUD with maybe a couple more specialized or niche pieces.",

Ridiculous. Jr and mid are cooked -salary is slightly lower than before, but way lower if account for inflation, so if you never got a promotion and just got inflation raises GL getting a new job that pays higher -most places interview process have streamlined. It’s usually recruiter -> tech screen OR take home -> final around (3-5 hours) so 3 rounds total. Those with take home are nearly guaranteed a final round if u submit the correct answer",

I have a mix of Big Tech and startup experience (including an industry recognized staff+ role) and applied to a handful of places and heard back from most. At most places I had a referral. All jobs were \"desirable\" jobs and companies. Sorry for being a bit vague, I keep the personal details vague on reddit.I learned two lessons from the search. First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to \"know the moves\" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on. The market seems to be rough for pure engineering management roles unless your previous team was a strong match for the role.",

Really when I'm hiring someone, I expect them to understand the theory and to be able to quickly apply that theory in any project. There are cases where having an expert on a specific framework, language, or technology is extremely useful. However, for most grunt work, being able to just apply best practices is good enough.",

I really was not looking for anymore money when I hit 300, even didn’t care the next year when I went back down to 250 for a more interesting role. Every step of the way I was happy and had enough. Also every step of the way I wanted to learn more and have better roles and more often than that it came with more money. I can say now at $500k/yr I truly would not care if I never make more than this. I’m just trying to hold onto what I have. I spend $0 more than when I made $250k. I’ve had the same house since I was making under $200k/yr. The only thing it changes really (for me) is just not ever worrying about money, which is highly valuable on its own. If I never passed $300k I think I would’ve been perfectly happy. I know people making 500 who desperately want to make it to L7 so they can make more than $1mil/yr, but I don’t really think they want it to buy grand things, they want it to just see the number.",

The recruiter mentioned that PE is about 60% software engineering, which I confirmed in follow-up interviews.One of my PE screeners was in a commerce team of 15. The PE said they spend about 50% of their time either planning or executing software projects. Executing to them meant writing code once all details have been figured out.The other PE screener had 10 years at Meta, and was in security and had no direct peers. They said recently they had been trying to get the whole organization to start using yubikeys.Like SWE, PE is just too broad of a term.

The other thing is that at a big company like Meta, most of their systems will be custom built, so you probably can’t google anything. So when something breaks you just ask your boss how to fix it. Repeat that every day for a few years and pretty soon the newer people will be asking you how to fix it. You can try to write docs but they usually go out of date and are hard to find stuff in. Also some people intentionally avoid writing docs to give themselves job security. In the end you’ll become a “Meta engineer”, ie an expert in whatever custom tooling Meta has built. The highest performers will simply be the people who have been there the longest and absorbed all of the internal knowledge. A new joiner, even if they’re really smart, will not be able to do anything except ask their boss how to fix stuff for many months.",

If you are and if the AI is actually even close to correct then either you have an insanely good model or it didn't require a lot of critical thinking in the first place.In my experience AI is great when you tell it what to do, however knowing/finding out what to do is literally more than half of your job - so why would this be reducing the critical thinking you'd be doing?Other than that - pushing for specific AI usage metrics is cringe, but it's a fad and will pass.",

That is your only leverage, and you will only risk souring the relationship early, which is the worst possible spot to be in. Being unemployed is bad, but having a weird short job on your resume isn’t also pretty bad. Take the job, if you’re unhappy just keep interviewing and don’t say anything about it. If you convert to FTE you might have a bit more leverage.Edit: just to be explicit here: they will not give you a raise, unless you can say you’re between competing offers.",

If you think incompetent people are succeeding around you, then you do not understand the competencies that your organization values. You're right.

You have to grasp that you are part of a team, and if you aren't a team player, it doesn't matter what merits you believe you have over another team member. You aren't the one handing out the raises and promotions. The leaders of the team decide what the team values. So, if you don't like what the team values, that's fine. You can go find another team, but recognize that the game is the same. If you want to be valuable to the team, you have to show growth in ways that the team values, not just what you deem valuable. On the other hand, if you can't do that, and feel strongly that you know what is valuable better than anyone else, that's the spirit that drives entrepreneurs. Your path to a good boss might be becoming your own, but you better be able to sell your authority as the guy who knows to clients, and understand what they find valuable.",

Maybe mid-level engineer from what I can tell. You might be able to even upsell as a senior engineer in some places pretty easily depending on your confidence and leadership ambitions. Obviously the work you did won't be a tit-for-tat match with a backend engineer working on some Java WebLogic crap or something but at the end of the day what's more important is that you clearly have the background skills to build complex data pipelines.I'd say focus on selling your FAAS and AWS cloud skillset, those are pretty important in modern infra. >How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field? What's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews?You're probably not really all that rusty. Go do a few LCs and you'll be right back to golden most likely. The important thing to recognize is that if you've done it once, you can do it all again. >Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? I think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. Also, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing. I don't have the personal experience with the BIG data boys though, as my only experience with ETL was with a financial firm myself doing similar work as yours but I can't imagine the practice is somehow deprecated and forgotten to time already. >And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?You can't really build technical depth without working on some larger systems imo. So either build your own or work with what you've got. I built some side projects for fun back in the day that I never really took anywhere but just used to keep my cloud knowledge fresh and available. But realistically you can probably just get by with some refresher courses.",

I relearned some fundamentals using Udemy and started working on my Master's degree. I also picked up courses in System Design using [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com) and educative.io. I use ChatGPT a lot to create study guides for myself when I interview at companies, I try to get a refresher on their tech stack so I can speak their language. I also started doing Leetcode religiously, completed Neetcode's 150 and have about 170 problems on Leetcode.com. It's been a rough journey where I've been passing DSA interviews and System design interviews, but now companies are starting to ask on the job syntax questions to really filter down candidates. There's just too many of us, the market is overly saturated. So now I'm on the grind, building apps from scratch and iterating on it over and over again until I have the syntax down to a T as well. We'll see how my next interviews go. I've had friends in the same boat and I had one friend that studied LC for 6 months straight to get into Meta, but ended up failing the System Design. The other thing is they're super picky about languages now, if you say you know Java, they want you to do their stupid LC in Java. As if knowing syntax is going to make you a good engineer....I've been unemployed for a year and still looking, so you're not alone.People that are employed will never understand what we're going through. In fact, they wouldn't even pass their own interviews today. I can guarantee you that I have more skill than any of them in any system design interview or leetcode question. All they know is how to interview people and of course when you have all the answers in front of you it's easy to do that.Stay strong my brother, I've also considered other roles that are closely related like Customer Support Engineer, DevOps, IT Support, and wait until the economy gets better. I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately. This industries has a lack of respect for senior engineers with the way they treat their engineers. I, too, might have to exit the field as well. I still really enjoy coding and building things, but it may have to do be something I do as a hobby for now instead of professionally.",

It sounds like some of the questions you’re trying to ask the CEO are actually things you should be asking the senior engineer on your team. Your conversations with the CEO should be about how that relationship is working and how to restructure the team in such a way that you and the intern can get the support you need. That might mean pulling another senior onto the team, it might mean folding this team into a larger one that has a manager and more senior devs etc, or it might mean just moving you to one of those other teams.",

I learned a whole, whole lot, though mostly on my own in terms of technical stuff, but a lot on the business side from being in such a small and early company.It's not for everyone, but contrary to most other comments, I see it as a great opportunity because instead of sitting down and trying to figure out a project to work on to practice, learn, and solve problems, which is hard, you actually have that part taken care of. You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...Hence, why its the \"senior junior\" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...Those things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.But, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay. It also qualifies you much more towards startups/early/growth since the dynamics and environment, as well as associated skills and knowledge, aren't the same as more matured process and product. So it can be a little harder when trying to transition to something else, but I think its excellent experience to have.I feel like it may be easier to go from startup to mid+ than the other way around. Just my thoughts.",

What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.But technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.I'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.That being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore. The expectation became that I was the mentor.",

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.So basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the \"leave now\" option is likely better. Amsterdam is also a good place to start, the next opportunity might be in Berlin, which is also a nice city but much more of a culture shock, and more depressing in winter.",

It all depends on how many questions you ask about how we got here, and your salesmanship when explaining it to a potential employer.

I think in most cases management does not even know what \"quality code\" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job. Now SWE \"talent\" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor. Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",

It can happen and far more frequently. Getting married to an old and obviously shit ideology will never help. Keep your head high and senses alert to find your opportunities. Although anecdotal, I always thought working at Google would be my dream job and the last place I work before retiring. But that went out the window for various factors. Instead I found a new opportunity that is far better in every aspect quite literally and I just stumbled on it by accident. It is one of the harder industries to break into and I found the easy way in by luck. Sometimes luck is all you need to catch a break. And you will be surprised how often luck will show itself. It is up to you to grab it by the throat and be tactful about it Learn and live",

That's why we hired him, not because he wrote some cool software. He understood the software development lifecycle, and how to ship a product that customers love. The business outcomes are noticeably better compared to ticket-takers who crank out functions to spec and don't care or want to know anything about end-users.Assuming your resume looks like every other \"Junior studying computer science at a State University in the US\", I'd probably give you an interview assuming I had an opening (I don't). Timing matters; If you're the 100th resume my HRBP has forwarded since the req opened, it's probably not going to matter how good/bad your resume is because I've probably already scheduled ~8 interviews and don't need to (nor can I because of my availability) schedule any more.

A lot of my webdev friends are struggling to find work, but my C/C++ and embedded peers are only slightly affected by the downturn in the job market.Another thing that can differentiate a project is using project management software to drive it. Most companies use Jira or similar to track tasks. Showing familiarity with Jira, it's git integrations, and following workflows does a lot to assure companies you can be productive and provide metrics. I, personally, don't put a lot of stock in such metrics, but the people hiring sure do. In the same vein, having examples of unit tests and CI/CD are also big. It shows you've thought about the whole development process.",

I'm currently working in the casino industry. To get an internship at our company, your personal projects would need to be relevant to what our company does. For example, web technologies are not useful to what we do, but Unity/C#/C++/art/statistics/game design are. We're a relatively small company, so we often \"wear many hats\", so showing non programming skills, such as leadership/project management/QA would also be helpful. After you get the interview, showing an interest in the company and industry would be important to us, along with being a good communicator and a team player.One of my coworkers and myself recently attended a career fair at a local university,. recruiting for internships. We each had a line of candidates at least fifty people deep for over three hours. Some in the line were in completely unrelated fields trying to convince us that they could do the work.Some were people who had graduated and been looking for work for over a year and were willing to work for internship pay.Some had unrelated software skills.The people who stood out were the ones who had relevant skills and who had researched our industry and our company beforehand. We put their resumes into a separate pile for further screening.",

I don’t know whether many people actually pick up on it but similarly I suspect many of the metrics people provide about how they produced something that made some difficult to measure metric x% more efficient at their 2 month internship are also hyperbole.

The honest answer is that it 1) takes time to get a hang on things like user stories and in general knowing the codebase and 2) don’t be afraid to ask questions.I’d say I felt really comfortable at around 1.5 years of working on the project before I stopped asking the senior dev. May seem like a lot but it’s better than pretending to know. I’d recommend making a documentation of some kind on the codebase and being diligent in recording each step taken when doing a task. Then you can refer back to your notes and eventually it starts to paint an overall picture of the code base you are working on. For example start by creating notes on the files in the code base you are most familiar with and then move on from there. Can even be 2-3 sentences if you don’t fully know - Auth.ts “This code deals with the security of client.” Eventually with good documentation will help clear things up, good luck!",

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task. This comes with time, and I find that not stressing out about unknowns is just as important as being competent in the domains you do know.",

I've got over 3 years of professional dev experience, a master degree, published academic research in AI applications, and I was laid off 3 months ago.

        "body": "If you’re working as a repair tech, you definitely don’t have zero experience. That’s hands-on hardware and troubleshooting work. The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews. If you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) If you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. You mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience. Focusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.Again this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience. Find your passion and drive yourself into it, employers will notice that more than you realize.",

Angry employees don't tend to give the most honest, or \"fair\" reviews. Someone who just got fired for bad performance usually isn't going to go on Glassdoor and write a review that says \"Got fired, my fault, great company though!\". They're going to do everything they can to drag that company through the mud.Positive reviews are the same way. Those usually aren't very genuine either. HR often encourages their employees to leave positive reviews while they work there. Those won't be genuine either.An anecdote of mine, I was considering joining an established startup, and their Glassdoor had a bunch of reviews complaining about nepotism, and how if you aren't buddy buddy with the CEO, you'll never get good raises or get promoted.I didn't get that vibe at all when I spoke with my hiring manager, the team, a manager from another team, and the CTO. So I joined them anyways.I stayed at that company 5 long years. I got *several* of the biggest raises I've gotten in my 12 year long career there, by a pretty huge margine. I got promoted twice, including to Senior, without any action or politicking on my part, they were handed to me on merit unprompted.I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work. I don't like to chit chat, I don't like going to company happy hours. I certainly wasn't buddies with the CEO or CTO (or anyone for that matter). Doubt the CEO even knew my name. The CTO and I spoke once in a blue moon. I just went into work and did my job, and then left. And yet, huge raises, multiple promotions.Pretty sure the people that were leaving those negatives reviews didn't get good raises or promotions *because they didn't deserve them*. So they blamed it on nepotism.",

I think a lot about work even on holidays, I have a lot of on call, and even when I'm not on call the person on call would often send me a message for advice if it gets ugly.Depending on where you work, tech can be very different to other careers, also the responsibility you have once you're maxed out on access and trust is a bit crazy when you think about it - two on-call developers in trusted positions could cause *very serious* damage to both a company and its users making a big mistake, and big tech companies have tens to hundreds of millions of users (and some, billions).Sometimes it's very crushing, and other times you feel like you've found some kind of cheat code profession, I would say it is very unique (though I've only ever worked a single job out of tech so I can't say).It varies a lot from employer to employer and the subject matter of your company, some jobs ago I worked for HR/PM software and I literally could not care less if something went wrong, extremely low stress job for me.Currently am working with things that would cause very big monetary losses if something went wrong, very very big stress because I have to make decisions in an extremely fast moving industry.Fun?

Stuff that used to be easy is now annoying, stuff that used to be difficult is now easy. \\* About this point you understand what it's good for, and what it's bad at. You've changed the way you think such that the annoying parts are not annoying anymore.\\* Finally, you are seasoned enough to use and enjoy it for what it's good for - and skip over it for what it's not.

At the current level of capability, it's really good at simple things that are good enough. Vibe coding shines as a foil for discussion around what the next steps look like for the problem. If the vibe-coded system works well enough, use it.This is no different than the unending number of spreadsheets companies use to run their operations. If it's good enough, keep using it.

I'm not sure why, but quite a lot of devs, thinks that I've deployed and that's the end of my part, who cares if we are burning money on the cloud because of some stupid settings. EDIT: Basic knowledge for me is -> understanding how we can use (proper usecases) most common services (S3, RDS, Dynamo, SQS etc) and aws is billing us for using them. Infra as a code is something that I'd say you can easily learn by doing, but of course additional points.",

I had three great candidates for the last role I hired for and could only pick one. Any of them would have done a fine job in the role, but I only had one opening.I also would still try for higher paying roles, even if you think that you're unqualified. Someone might see your resume and be willing to give you a chance,. especially if you're more affordable than the other candidates. Don't sell your skills short.If you get the interview, be passionate and knowledgeable about the company you're interviewing with. Be able to talk about the items on your resume in detail. Be a good communicator and a team player. Make the person think you're a hard worker. I know that sounds silly, but you'd be surprised at the number of candidates who I interview who only want to work with certain technologies and don't want to do anything outside of their degree.Try to be one of the first people to apply for every role you see. Candidates who apply early at my company have a huge advantage.",

When I was looking last year, I received more callbacks from out-of-state than in-state (California).

You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).For example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this \"I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training.\" Of course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).Using an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. Also, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",

What you can get though is users, i.e., people using your app.As far as \"why do you want to work for the company\" you can always highlight something about their culture on the job requirement or company page if they have it, or the programming stack they use, etc. No one is posting on the job requirement that their culture sucks and their stack is shit, they will present it in a positive light you can latch on to.

        "body": "There's a wide range in consulting companies. Some have great software practices and mentoring, and you will be doing the same work as any other developer. Others have everyone fending for themselves. You need to try to figure out which one the company you're talking to is. Another problem is if they're a smaller company, they might have fewer clients. Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. Another challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. Try to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting. Especially with less experience, you'll probably be doing more development work. Normally, the higher you are in a company, the more they want you to be doing sales. You also want to get an idea of how they get new projects, and what their project pipeline looks like.",

I will say usually when it's looking bad now, it's safe to assume to say it would look better in 3 years and the best time to get into something is when everyone is avoiding it. I get the fear of AI, but the way i see it AI will either replace jobs or can make more jobs. Like if a a team of 10 can complete 30 tasks (3 each) in a month without a AI. But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.Now if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE. I knew many kids who dropped out of CS and CE because they couldnt handle the coidng classes. Coding was much harder than they expected. In my school IT was seen as the CS dropout degree because IT had a low application rate, but a high transfer rate. Like IT courses would be empty fall of freshman year but by spring of freshman or fall of sopohemore year, the classes would be packed.",

HumbleBundle also has very affordable lesson packs off of Udemy and the like, but what and when is variable.For quality... aside from the obvious (adequate video/audio quality, not wrong, etc) the next most important is having you actually do stuff, ideally mostly on your own - you're not going to learn much with cargo cult copypasta. Ideally, the lessons will also intentionally steer you into making mistakes (Code Ninjas is good for that), so you can recognize errors, see how to debug them, and recognize them in the future.",

The second time was more recent for a similar role as before on the same team with the same manager who remembered me and still wanted me on their team. I was interviewing as an E6 this time but I was told the initial screening was pretty much identical. I crushed the first problem and had tons of time for the second but the screener didn't understand my solution and kept interrupting me questioning my approach. I understood the approach they were suggesting and even explained it to them and why mine was actually superior and closer to real-world implementations for the specific problem presented. I tried my best to educate, and when it was clear that they just weren't going to get there I tried to power through and get my implementation in at least pseudocode hoping that either someone else would review it or the interviewer would research offline and get there eventually. That didn't happen and I was rejected. I reached out to the HM but their hands were tied by policy so I was screwed.

You never know when they will start asking you questions and expect you know the answer to. \\- Ive started to use AI in my work and honestly it's really nie to understand the codebase. Use it as a pair programming tool. But dont rely on it too heavily. Make sure you understand what it's trying to convey. I have founda. few errors or things that the AI overlooks. I.e. I was trying to create a new print statement andasked the AI to go through it as it was a new field and needed to touch like 10 files. When i tested it, it wasnt working and i realized that at no point did the AI ever make sure that all the cases were covered because there was one case that would never hit because we never set that variable.\\- Ask questions and try to befriend older engineers. This is key. It's scary but you gotta play the game. The game isnt always getting as much out there, it's how your coworkers speak of you. Many jr engineers will twiddle their thumbs, SWEs hate that. Dont twiddle your thumbs, if you are stuck ask anybody. In stand up say, I am stuck. It goes a long way when you can say that openly.\\- when you complete something, show proof of it. Ask for 15 minutes post stand up to display in front of team. The team will lvoe that. \\-if you have a mentor, use that person but also try to cut the cord as quickly as you can. Ive seen jr engineers kind of cling to the mentor andwhenver they get stuck they just wait for the mentor to come back rom their 3 hour meeting even when they know where to go to but are too afraid of going themselves.",

        "body": "I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.Here are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.First of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)After that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.You need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.You need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.Security is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.Overall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",

I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.Have you done system design interviews? That will honestly cover 80% of what you need to know for BE stuff, and every cloud host has their own version of the sys design components that you’ll study.

If you want to specialize in the creative side of things you'll need to work on developing more advanced technical skills such as graphics/shader programming, webGPU/webGL, Three.js, and etc. to distinguish yourself. I believe the general industry title for such roles is \"creative developer\" - basically a developer with a focus on the areas I mentioned alongside all the existing requirements of a frontend developer. Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.I personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation. That being said however if you're passionate about this then you should continue to pursue it inside and outside of work whenever you can - often times in your career you'll stumble upon opportune moments, so having the right skill set at the right time can definitely lead you down a desirable path!",

Most front end devs are making client apps with enterprise applications where the UX insights to be mindful of are about making it intuitive to sort through complicated workflows with lots of data. If you know how to target those more creative roles, great, but I have had to use far less of my graphic design skills even while working on e commerce and retail platforms.

Of course it's different for each company/program but in general contractors get paid bank. You're 3 years in which means your options might be limited but try and shoot for something closer to $150k imo. Also, don't worry about what people say regarding \"there's no job security\", they have literally no idea what they're talking about. I know the ins and outs of a lot of Defense Contractors and contracting firms. I don't work for one myself, but I know for a fact that they don't just lop off the limbs so easily.It's obviously LESS secure than your typical FTE role but it's not some scam lmfao. Also, there's ALWAYS another contract you can hop to. Trust me, it's ridiculous. I get about 4-5 calls literally every single day from contracting firms looking to pull me onto a new program.
