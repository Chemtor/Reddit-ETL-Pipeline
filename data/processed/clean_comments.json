Pretty much all of the high ups that I know—C-suite, people making 300k+ in high value consulting, managing directors at global firms—have gotten their jobs in a incestuous web of companies, and usually from someone they worked with in the past. Engineering manager jobs or 250k+ jobs—jobs with limited availability and high demand—don’t usually go to unknowns. I’m not saying it’s impossible, I’m just saying that your career path is what has put you in your current position. You are not trying to make an obvious next step, but break through in a qualitative way.I don’t think there are really…immediate concrete steps as simple as “write a better cover letter.”",

It isn’t about what they “do” differently, it’s simply a consequence of the portfolio they’re hired for.Large tech companies run portfolios covering at least a single digit percent of global compute in that space. For example, if you’re a data engineering manager at Meta on the social media side, you’re probably responsible for a single digit global percent of your area (ads, content review, infra, analytics) etc.As such, you can compute the “budget” each company assigns to the average employee on the back of declared margins. **This is where, even if you think you’re changing the world with your work in a company / sector that isn’t profitable. . . You’re probably correct in your assessment that you’re doing better work than your counterpart in a FAANG job, but in the end, it doesn’t matter.**To answer your question about what to do, it’s the same things you would think if you were running that portfolio and hiring: Build domain familiarity with real, practical, demonstrable experience in the technology stack that particular organization you’re looking to get into works on. . Network heavily with people adjacent to that team on LinkedIn or through real introductions from a senior person in the company (this works more often than you think) and try to get on the radar of the recruiters in a non desperate way(The variance here is massive)In the end, once you’re “in” . . It’s a small world and everyone kinda knows each other and end up cycling through the same companies if they’re decent enough at what they do.

Tap into your network, because cold applications on job board sites or LinkedIn aren't going to get it done (on that note, be on high alert for employment scams).Snowflake is having its BUILD event next week (I believe it's a free online-only event), so that could be an opportunity learn new things and potentially network.Also, look for and sign up for hackathons or any sort of other networking and portfolio-building opportunities.Don't make the mistake of simply applying to jobs online (unless you have a healthy amount of severance from the layoff, and you just want to take some time off).

Data scientists usually need to spend more time conceptualizing the model and figure out what the problem is, what the model should do, how to engineer the data to accurately represent the business scenario, what are the biases in it, what are the limitations of the model, etc. These challenges take enough of their time and mental capacity that considering anything more will actually lead to compromising the model quality. They also tend(based on my own bias) to be non-coders, like statisticians, phds, analytics etc., and the technical aspects like package compatibility, resource limitations, pipeline and deployment don't really come to their mind. It's not that they are not bothered, it's just that they are not aware of the challenges engineers deploying the project face.I understand the challenges engineers face and it can be so frustrating. Awareness and communication between the two teams is important. Make them aware of the issues you face. Help them understand the importance of following coding standards. There are so many tools nowadays which can help with all these challenges, if the data scientists are aware of it, they will definitely use it to make your experience better and make the overall process faster and smoother.",

It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.The same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.But that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning. The new metadata-driven clustering is much more flexible and effective at that.",

The ability to move partitions between tables is also enormously useful; it's often quicker to build a new version of partition and swap it in than to use update or delete/insert etc.",

Instead of physically co-locate files to nested folders (partitions) it just mark in a metadata that \"this parquet file is related to cluster (partition) X\" in a corresponding metadata JSON-file. This is not my understanding. Liquid clustering, and clustering in general, is about how the data is physically written in a specific order in a file. It's not just metadata (although there are). If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)Please let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.The difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost. This dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs. A quick way to remember the main difference between partitioning and clustering: - partitioning → directories: determines which subdirectory a record goes into.- clustering → files: determines which specific file a record goes into and how records are arranged within files.",

I modelled everything myself, in a working solution, where the data indeed was really messy. It helped me tremendously, compared the on on-job-training my DE colleagues got. And later on I was dragged on to DE projects in various roles, and while not certain to get your anything, it sure can help a ton.* As for point 3: In general true, especially from a technical point of view. But in my part of the world, northern Europe it is becoming more the standard, that customers ask for x% of consultants to have Y certificates. So with a more commercial point of view, you can say, that while everyone can study and get Databricks' data engineer associate+engineer data professional without useful experience, they matter for contracts. And if you have the choice between hiring 2 candidates that are rated quite equal, I would take the person with the certifications, because you don't have to ask the new guy take certs on company time.As for your last point, with no number; that is where I really disagree. The majority don't work in companies where they work with the most modern tech. Then you let your company decide the ceiling of your skills/knowledge. The few paid certifications and courses your get on company time every year is usually focused on already established topics. When your boss (or his boss(es)) asks about stuff from outside the regular box it is worth a lot to be able to know about it. You get to lead test projects, you get to be placed on actual projects. Or you learn some technique or alternatives solutions that can benefit you on the job. This part you should do regardless of you enjoying it or not, to get tale.

The China team was very effective despite the time difference, the India team was not (and frankly, the competency gap was embarrassingly stark).This resulted in a \"snap-back\" in jobs that there offshored back to locations in NA (the US specifically). Essentially, almost all offshored employees were laid off, and all contracts canceled.The business argument that was made was basically: \"It costs almost as much to employ Chinese DEs as in the US, with comparable competency levels, but a timezone gap issue. Meanwhile, we can employ 2-3 Indian employees/contractors for the cost of one competent US employee, but not only is there a timezone gap, there are seemingly a ton of communication issues, like sudden unannounced PTO/Holidays taken during product launches for example, and even when you can reach them, you're lucky if even 1 of these employees can write basic SQL code.\"The result was a much more robust vetting of US based employees, including several rounds of technical interviews, and thorough background checks...Edit to add context: The hiring practices when offshoring to India were pathetically lackadaisical.Basically, the process was: Recruiter: \"Do you know SQL?\" Candidate: \"Yes\" Recruiter: \"Are you willing to work for peanuts? (~30-40% of US-based DE)\" Candidate: \"Yes\" Recruiter: \"You're hired!\" Candidate: \"Yes\" Recruiter: \"Great! Though um, that wasn't a yes or no question.\" Candidate: \"Yes\"And let's be real, it doesn't matter where you're hiring from, if that's your process, expect this result.Meanwhile, the NA and EU candidates I've observed have been going through the wringer, with multiple (as many as 5-6) rounds of technical interviews that span 3-4 MONTHS!

        "body": "I have a lot of thoughts on the statement \"Data Contracts are only as good as the data tests that back them up.\"While at face value I agree with this as best practice, it doesn't align with the value prop of data contracts. In particular, data contracts require preventive enforcement, and if you are profiling data, it means incorrect data has already been written to database systems and is propagating across the business. If anything, I argue that data profiling is more closely tied to data observability, which complements data contracts but serves a different purpose.I argue that data contracts need enforcement where data is either first generated, captured, or ingested. In the Glassdoor case study above, they use static code analysis to extract metadata from the code to determine what function calls in the application relate to a data asset. Then apply LLMs to this highlighted code to determine the codified business logic irrespective of the data. Enforcement of expectations on the code ensures prevention via CI/CD before the code is deployed and thus before data is written.My recent article [*Your Data Contracts Are in the Wrong Spot*](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/your-data-contracts-are-in-the-wrong) goes into more detail on this.",

Our latest Sail 0.4 release introduces native Apache Iceberg support and provides major architectural improvements to Delta Lake execution. The release also lays the foundation for distributed DML operations across open data formats and marks a key step toward Sail’s goal of a fully unified lakehouse engine.# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source, Rust-native, multimodal computation framework which includes drop-in replacement compatibility for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built from the ground up in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by up to 94%. Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.# What’s New in Sail 0.4* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.# Join the Slack CommunityWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)! Whether you’re exploring Sail for the first time, migrating workloads, or contributing code, here you can collaborate, ask questions, and help shape the future of data infra.Check out the full release post here → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/)Would love to hear your thoughts!",

Both your Iceberg and Delta docs state that 'it is not recommended to use Sail to overwrite or modify existing [tables] created by other engines.' Does this mean the migration process for existing tables is reading the existing table, writing a new one, and removing the original? What about in reverse - can I write a table with Sail and update it from Spark?2. What's your funding model? Hosted platform / services at some point?",

With it in market 3 years now.I will say Fabric would be a WAY easier transition for folks because of the integrations with Power BI, Excel and power query and you can grow into more SQL based things. (I had the same background but also have had strong SQL before I was mainly doing Power Query and PowerBI)the Low Code Layer is great with the Other side to grow into Deeper coding.

There's direct and native Power BI integration either through direct lake storage modes for semantic models, or through just importing into a normal import mode models. But also Power Query (Dataflows Gen2) are a great tool for the low code analysts that already know those tools. You can use dataflows pretty much anywhere on the platform. Since it sounds like you have a data savvy team and you're looking to increase your maturity and capabilities, I think investing in some fabric training and help with codifying some design patterns would be really beneficial (if you go with Fabric) to get your team started on the right foot.",

        "body": "I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements6. Depends on your definition of \"seamless\" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously. I can't imagine a scenario where Snowflake wouldn't be able to scale to your needsSnowflake documentation is pretty good, and readable, so is always a useful place to start if you want to get a better understanding of the platform in general or specific capabilities : [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started)",

Practically speaking, it means Snowflake, Mozart, and other companies that want to use dbt Fusion engine as part of an offering will have to get different licensing from dbt Labs.dbt Labs has continued to pour most of their resources into dbt Platform (rebrand of dbt Cloud), and I don't see that changing.

Yes, it's probably the same devs doing the work, but if Fusion is the future and you make zero money on core, from a business perspective what do you think they leave behind?I don't care what's in the news and what they say will happen going forward. The merge happened for business and money reasons. When that happens, lowering expenses and increasing sales becomes the game. Their investors are looking for profits and speed. Developing 2 of the same product doesn't fit that mold.With that said, it's in their best interest to continue the dev on both until there is feature parity and Fusion is ready for prime time.

I work for a mid-size CPG company in the US that has more or less the same framework:- ingestion: raw data lands in redshift, separate schema for each source (raw schema for transactional source, separate raw schema for crm, another for customer support platform, etc). Method for ingestion varies by source, but the end result is the same. On our side we use a combination of stitch for some prebuilt connectors for SaaS applications, lamda for unstructured data that lands first in S3, and some custom python scripts hosted on ec2 for the various odds and ends- transformation: dbt transforms raw schema in redshift to cleaned data marts. I recommend putting thought into how you want to structure your transformation layers in dbt, and then just try to stay consistent. Dbt has their own recs on how to structure, and that's more or less what we do (staging, intermediate, and marts): https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview- analytics: some sort of viz or BI tool that references the cleaned data marts exclusively. You don't want business users building reports off the raw staging dataYou can probably find lots of sample dbt projects online, that mostly look the same in terms of structure. Just figure out what works for you, write out some rules for your org, and try to stick to it.",

And for the orchestration you have two options, the aws way is to use ec2 batch with a Ami that you built with all the dependencies that will have the dbt project on ir or will pull it from s3, that aws batch will be managed by a step function and schedule with event bridge.

Once all the records are united by a single ID, you can then reconcile the data points according to whatever logic you like.In your case, you could also maybe add a column for like, 'ID\\_Type' and give it values like 'guid', 'email', 'phone' etc., where you have CRMs using those things as their unique identifiers. The nice thing about this set up is you aren't limited to one ID per system.The output of such a table would look something like this: +-------------------+-----+------------+ | Internal/Master ID| ID | ID_System | +-------------------+-----+------------+ | 1 | 123 | SAP | | 1 | 456 | SalesForce | | 1 | 789 | SalesForce | | 1 | 101 | SalesForce | | 2 | 987 | SAP | | 2 | 654 | SalesForce | | 2 | 321 | SalesForce | | 2 | 852 | SalesForce | +-------------------+-----+------------+",

A lot of people handle this with a global entity model basically a mapping table or “golden record” layer that defines a master key and stores relationships between all the source keys. Once that’s in place, it becomes way easier to model downstream joins, star schemas, or data marts without worrying about mismatched IDs.

If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)). Might be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.Also if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.I haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt. Just FYI you can use dbt Core with Airflow, a great way there is Cosmos. Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer, we made Cosmos (which is OSS, so you can run it no matter how you run Airflow), adopted and maintain the DAG Factory and do managed Airflow, so I am biased towards Airflow. Though in this case I guess I just gave an assist to cloud composer which is our competitor. If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",

You get the bonus of having quality control by having your SQL (dbt models) version controlled and peer reviewed via pull requests. Also control over deployments. Your dbt code should be in a repository with a CI process that tests it and then publishes an image to Google Artifacts Registry. Cloud Run will pick up the image when Composer runs it, just use the Cloud Run Operator.Sure newer orchestration tools like Dagster and Prefect a bit sexier. Airflow is proven, its flaws are well known and it will do you (and many many others) just fine. Cloud Composer simplifies the management of it quite a bit and that is the route I'd go.

ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc. But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow: * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up). * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI. * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there. * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)). * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",

This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the \"single source of truth\" for all your data platform.

These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size.

While vendor-created terms and patterns are not inherently bad (the data lakehouse pattern is super useful), their purpose is to provide an \"onramp\" into understanding new ideas you want the market to adopt. I say that to not get too caught up on the terms, especially if that's the main sticking point for your org to adopt (this was my case).",

With this you can simply connect your end DB directly to the iceberg catalog as the front and get a good performance as the majority of them have native iceberg connectors.

Whether or not you use that, you’ll need to match names in a way that discounts common words and prioritizes uncommon words. Most distance metrics don’t work well for this because you’ll get really high values for names that aren’t actually that close. For example, using Levenshtein distance “apple corporation” and “Snapple corporation” (different companies) are very close, but “Bernstein Partnership, LTD” and “Bernstein” (same company) are not. You can look at various text vectorization models on huggingface that should be able to account for the fact that “corporation” is basically meaningless while “Snapple” is significant. If you have enough data you may even be able to just use tf-idf.If you want you can then lay on hierarchical clustering or just use a score cutoff.Last, you’ll probably want this wrapped up with some kind of feedback mechanism so you can make a lookup table to unify known alternatives over time. Once you know that A and B are actually C, you can store it in a table so you don’t have to run this expensive analysis on those names again",

I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg \"Used X medical device to do Y procedure.\"). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.Where to start:1. You have to understand the business logic and what a \"meaningful\" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). 4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say \"as much as possible\" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.You now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders. Bonus, if it's a huge success, you now also have direct metrics for employee reviews/resume.Please note that this was back in 2020. So there may be better methods than this, but here's an example of something that was deemed successful at the company.",

I was using BQ before my current role with Redshift. My company also has 1 department that uses Snowflake, which accounts for maybe 2% of our data warehouse usage. That 2 percent costs us the same in 1 week on Snowflake as the other 98% costs us in a month with Redshift. Overall, Redshift does what you need it to do, and it's pretty freaking cheap compared to the alternatives. It's not the best database out there, but for the price, I honestly can't complain.",

We don't run distributed for processing, Polars + custom Rust UDF on 2 server with 4TB of RAM each goes really really far. \"scan don't read\". Some GPU compute nodes and some lower perf compute nodes when it doesn't matter. We also use Airflow, it's fine, not amazing, not awful either.No vendor lock-in is really nice, we can deploy a whole \"mini\" version of our whole stack using docker compose for dev. Dev flow is great.Our user facing serving APIs are not on prem tho. It's just a big Rust stateless modulith with Tonic gRPC, Axum for REST and the data queries/vector queries are using LanceDB/Datafusion + object storage + Redis. Docker Swarm and Docker stack for deployment. We hit around sub-70ms P95, trying to get it down to sub-50ms it's really awesome.Most people stack is wayy to complex and wayy to overengineered.Edit: Some of the compute for ETL (more ELT) is on VPS in the cloud tho, but it feeds the on-prem setup. Edit: We do use Runpod a bit for bigger GPUs too. Buying those GPU for on-prem compared to Runpod pricing doesn't really make that much sense.",

General dev pods for engineers/devs/datascientists 100 GB NIC. Use case is a bunch of image processing some machine learning . 7 servers 6 compute with storage in and 1 GPU node might expand to more depending. Most work isn't LLMs but Machinelearning and Vision. Data is mix between Postgres/small appdbs and lots of blob storage. 2 GPU for LLM 2 GPU for other work. Probably need a few more GPU nodes depending on how much more people want to GPU accelerate. Whole stack is open source and currently dreading about Bitnami pulling up the ladder on container maintenance/closed sourcing stuff. Current stack about $300k recurring costs for software about 1k/node/year(OS License). My time and sanity however are not tied to a dollar amount. On prem for Security/cost once yo u start getting into PB scale or higher in data those cloud ingress/out fees along with storage capacity add up if you want it hot you can play with the Azure/AWS storage calculator to see. Cloud storage is great for arctic/freeze data for backups or old data costwise if you can spare it so hot -> cold cloud was always a good discussion.Took us a long time to organically set this up from scratch and bare metal and learn from scratch but I was happy for the opportunity.

The most complicated schema change IMO is usually changing the cardinality of the link (from 1:N to N:M or vice versa). If you're just adding elements (entities, links, attributes) then it would be easy, assuming that your database does not have too heavy traffic. But even then you could use things like side tables that are trivial to create without service interruption.\\> Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better?Depending on what you mean by \"putting more efforts\".\\> How should I know is my design is already fine?Uhm, I have an entire book that tries to answer your questions. Without trying to sell it directly, here is a 9000 words tutorial on designing a non-trivial application: [https://kb.databasedesignbook.com/posts/google-calendar/#how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka-idhow-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka](https://kb.databasedesignbook.com/posts/google-calendar/#how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka-idhow-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka)Specifically, the link points to \"How far ahead do you need to think?\" section.",

I can't find a way for that except just making a long list of notes on when they took a leave, and then adding back the number of sessions they took a leave. It is a mess. After all that mess, my manager still wanted me to also keep track of transactions in the monolithic spreadsheet. Well, that's the bell for me, I need to make this right. Haha.And then I also need to synchronize this excel sheet to an external spreadsheet for my sales team, and my company is a bit warry of google, so they don't want me to completely upload everything on there, I then need to manually select them, copy them, and make sure I don't copy the wrong stuff, and it's hard to synchronize the data if sales team managed to change some of it. Well, all and all, I also think this is a great opportunity for me to learn RDB, since I didn't have any hands-on experience with it, aside from vibe-coding a project using prisma etc, which I don't have any idea about anyway.",

Back the DE's play to centralize the data processing but bring up the issue that you have a critical problem right now. Bring up that the current DE is a single point of failure. If he gets hit by a car or decides to leave the company, the organization is screwed. Come up with a plan to have him do a structured knowledge transfer to MULTIPLE people in the company (yourself included). Have a series of meetings to go over the various parts of the data processing, structure, control, etc. And make sure that everyone understands. Your DE is going to resist this or play passive aggressive with you. Keep asking questions until it is perfectly clear to you what is going on. You may want to have that manager attend (or announce he will be there) for the first meeting or two. He has a vested interest in this. Don't let the DE consolidate the data flows until after the training and don't let him do the consolidation alone. ~~If~~ When he doesn't like it, this will give you ammo to demonstrate to the manager why this is a good plan.",

Stay away from the big 5 consulting generalists (think PwC, Deloitte, ET, many of the offshore consulting companies). Go with mid-tier regional players that specialize in the platform you're interested in (I prefer Snowflake). These tend to provide better service and can be more flexible. Also consider an initial engagement with 1 vendor where they are not able to bid on the down stream work (or at least that is what you tell them). The look others for the actual work. This will help reduce the chance that a vendor lowballs the effort required to get the work.Good luck",

So, for example, backing up your data or sharing a copy with a friend with PostgreSQL is a bit involved, while with SQLite, you just copy the file wherever.

You should do the math yourself but being an actual employee is not trivial. That being said if your spouse has health insurance and can get you on his plan this might not matter.2) SF will likely lead you to more opportunities long term. There’s a lot more in-person jobs coming back and it is highly advantageous to be here for future jobs moves. During my most recent job search, most if not all of the roles I found were in-person, and all of the highest-paid ones were in or around San Francisco. The same is true of my other friends in tech. Many of them who have roots elsewhere are struggling to find jobs that won't force them to relocate to SF. And a lot of places will pre-screen for candidates who already live here when searching LinkedIn. I likely would not have found my current role if I wasn't already based here.3) $150k is still a lot in SF. People talk a lot about the high COL and it's true that the bang-for-your-buck on rent is terrible. But how that usually shakes out is you just rent a place that's smaller/shittier than you would otherwise rent elsewhere, and then are left with more money than you know what to do with. I have plenty of friends who get by just fine on less than $100k/year here. With $150k and your spouse having an entire second income you'll be more than fine.4) the weather here in SF is way better",

The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes. Unless the workload as a whole requires more simultaneous executions instead of individual query performance.",

In Go, upsert into a raw schema with a unique constraint on a surrogate key like sha1(coalesce(key1,'') || '|' || coalesce(key2,'')); that kills dupes at the door and makes retries safe. For historicals, don’t chase “active only” upstream land everything and model “active” as an attribute. In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\\_key = that surrogate and check\\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\\_from/valid\\_to/is\\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. For incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes. Dimensions shouldn’t truncate soft-delete with an is\\_active flag and keep facts referentially stable.Dev workflow: dbt Core CLI + VS Code (SQLTools + dbt Power User), local DuckDB for rapid iteration, then target Postgres; add SQLFluff to keep SQL sane.

Then use `is_active` as a flag in the dimension to mark current vs historical rows. But I need clarification: should `is_active` live in the dimension table itself, or should I create a separate `fact_active_jobs` table and build off that?**On CDC and row versions:**Right now I'm pulling from an Oracle view that filters the ERP's fact table down to active jobs only—but that fact table has no `rowversion`. Should I (A) remove the filters at the view level and hash the full fact table as-is, or (B) go down to the base tables, use their `rowversion`, and rebuild the fact tables from scratch in dbt?Also, on the `is_active` dimension question: should that column live in the dimension table itself, or do I need a separate structure?**On soft-deleting dimensions:** I thought dimensions were supposed to maintain unbroken history by their nature. Wouldn't adding `is_active` and deleting rows break the sequence? And isn't it the fact table's job to differentiate active vs inactive in reports?**On dbt and orchestration:**1. I have IntelliJ—should I stick with that or move to VS Code + SQLTools like you suggested?2. Should I consider sqlmesh instead of dbt?3. Right now Go orchestrates everything sequentially (sync → dims → facts). Should I keep Go calling dbt, or move to pub/sub for reactive processing? or should i try to make postgres and dbt handle all the scheduling and keep go for syncing.4. Should the T in ETL be dbt, or should I use Python/Kotlin?**On keys in a star schema:** I'm confused about surrogate vs natural vs business keys. Should I use one or both in dimensions and facts? Should my primary keys be the business key, or the surrogate key?Thanks for taking the time; never went to college and learned this through videos, so I appreciate the clarity.",

Some exceptions to this would be changing local times to UTC, or normalizing well known data such as geographic data. Yes it’s technically not identical to the source system but it is faithful to it. Staging should not lose fidelity relative to the source system. Do not round financial measures in staging for example.Mart should be pretty refined and ready for analyst consumption. It should be thought of as your public facing API of sorts, even if consumers are internal or even on your team. This layer is generally modeled as either star schema or OBT.Everything else in between is intermediate. You can absolutely have intermediate tables feeding other intermediate tables.With that context, for your problem, I would create a staging model for each source that would cleanse/standardize/accumulate as appropriate. Then i might consider an intermediate table for anything that needs pivoting or otherwise need grain adjustment. Finally I would union them all together into your mart layer.",

In order to achieve optimal output, you need a balanced schedule that doesn’t push you past your limits. Don’t make it a you vs them thing, don’t worry if they’re toxic, don’t drink their poison and it won’t impact you. Make it about the very logical and reasonable concept of efficient and consistent productivity and what you need to achieve that.

You can use ADO.NET for C#, odbc drivers for most other languages (ex: pyodbc for Python), jdbc drivers for Java, and so on. You don't need an API integration for SSMS, you need one for the database itself (just like SSMS provides a human friendly integration with the database). Secondly, why are you using a long outdated version of SSMS? SSMS is free.Do you mean the database server itself is SQL Server 2014? If so, that's getting close to being out of Extended Security Updates availability too (mid 2027), but upgrading isn't free and takes effort, so it may be outside your control.",

You would also need a grant detail table for timestamped grants with reference to the header table. This detail table will also show the conformed user id associated with that specific grant. 3. Similarly add other tables based on the available entities. Add tables to track Financials, End of Period, Beginning of Period stuff. Basic DB setup and modeling. After all of these cleaning and organizing, once data is ready, building dashboard should not be a problem. You may star with less number of table at first, but breaking down data into a normalized form will help you with traceability. Have fun, with some experience you will build these models pretty quick in future, initial one may take time. Best of luck.",

Access has scalability issues, and more importantly, has issues with concurrent access from multiple users. SQL Server Express if you want to run locally or Azure SQL DB Free Tier (which gives you cloud backups, not to mention it being a service that isn't tied to a particular local machine you're running it on) are both much better options if you're going with Microsoft options IMO.Postgres or SQLite or many other OSS projects are great choices too.Just please, not Access. And if you insist, I believe the best practice is to use a \"split\" Access database where the frontend and backend are separate, and probably to use SQL Server Express or Azure SQL DB Free Tier as the backend half, rather than the Access Database Engine.

Given your relational claim, I guess you just pull the hierarchy of parent child from the JSON. That’s what I do anyway - if there is a label then that’s the entity name, if not then you need to allow labelling later. You need metadata about columns/fields and otherwise it’s pretty easy. This is just deserialisation and adding a single directional relationship. Anything more and you need the syntax/magic values that you seem to not like. I don’t have a degree in a related field but it just seems like basic information theory to me…Good you have a tool that saves you time :)",

Above that, HTTP is a conversation that usually happens on TCP port 80, and HTTPS is a somewhat different conversation that usually happens on TCP port 443.The important difference between the two is that to speak HTTPS, the server needs some sort of certificate that proves its identity. You can create a little temporary one for local testing, but if you want it to actually serve traffic on a domain name, it needs a real, trusted certificate. That certificate might be provided by whoever set up your domain, and often these days people use \"Let's Encrypt\" for this sort of thing.

        "body": ">But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.You can look into the concepts of a \"reverse proxy\", which is basically a web server deployed by a service provider that takes web requests and forwards them to some other service. The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called \"TLS termination\", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS. You'd do this if you don't trust the network infrastructure in the data center, e.g. because it runs a co-location server model where the server hardware owned by different entities is deployed within the same physical location.",

        "body": "> So I decided to build something, and http server in c++This is an excellent exercise and perfect for your academic level.> I know nothing about network programming, sockets or even portsYou don't need to know shit about any of this.HTTP is a text protocol. That makes it REAL simple... And - as it happens, standard streams are text streams. It's a marriage like it was meant to be.This means you implement the HTTP protocol: namespace methods { class GET; class POST; class PUT; class PATCH; class DELETE; class HEAD; class OPTIONS; class CONNECT; class TRACE; using method = std::variant; }I'll let you fill those out in detail, but I'm going to still jump around to get to my point.Next you need a request and a response type: namespace messages { class request: method { /* an incoming request is implemented in terms of one of the HTTP methods */}; class response; }Now here's where we're REALLY going to build on some of the magic: class request { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &); }; class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };Barring the rest of the class details, you need these functions. Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!I'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.But this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.See, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption. > nc -l 8080 -c your_serverSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.You want that shit encrypted? > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'It's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.As for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!So now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.Continued...",

I'll say, learning now is 100x easier than I remember, probably because the Internet wasn't as much of a thing back then.I did some Ruby to start, because I thought I wanted to make websites and it seemed like a good entry language. About a month in, I decided I didn't really need a website for anything, so I had no motivation.

But don't get me wrong, there are some times where I search for a simple answer to a question, and I have to go read a lot of docs or ask other questions to even understand what the other answers meant. I haven't considered turning my codding hobby into a career, maybe one day, but for now it's been keeping my mind engaged. Fixing \"the players name reverses when they turn to the left\" is infinetly more interesting than \"the heat in this guy's living room doesn't work\"edit: Sorry of this isn't super relevant, I'm sick so my mind wanders, but I typed it all in so I hit send.",

        "body": "Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. They may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. But what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like \"Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does\" or \"explain line 149 to me.\" I've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. If AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like \"this class uses a singleton pattern to do x\" you can follow up with \"what the heck is a Singleton?\"If the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.Navigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it. Lastly, you might be getting to a point where you should learn about common architectural patterns like OOP, SOLID, Dependency Injection, Layered Architecture, Clean Code, etc. Not all at once, of course.",

I rarely have documentation, and almost never have any sort of design document. My trick is to try to find a \"start\". In the language/environment I'm in, this is often an API Map or API router. Then I start drawing or creating a map of the code flow. I'll usually start with listing classes/methods (it works in my environment) and essentially making a class map, but for methods. What parameters, can I quickly guess what it does by the name or the code? What does it return? And then I get any methods or objects that method creates or calls. I work down that list. Essentially figuring out where I am in the web of function and method calls. As far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into \"make a PB&J sandwich steps\" like this:If my pseudocode looks like this: int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){ int[] retArr; for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){ retArr[i]=i+pAddToI; } return retArr; }I might write:**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object**Params:****Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.**Returns:** Integer array**Process**: 1) Creates a integer array for return2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. 3) Returns retArr---------If there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up. Look at documentation, ask co-workers. My language is not indexed well by any AI (proprietary language, most of the documentation is hidden behind paywalls), and sometimes I do have to talk to *gasp* real people or RTFM. But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.I usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom \"Calls\" and \"CalledBy\" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents. My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a \"model\" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). The benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code. Even reading single methods and writing them out, in \"make a pb&j sandwich steps\" will help in the long run. It's certainly time consuming, and reading code and writing it down like this helps you learn how to read code more quickly.",

        "body": "Let's take the square root example.If your function is just calling sqrt(x) and returning, then no that'd be silly to unit test - but then again why would you have such a function in the first place?Let's say the function is actually computing the square root using Newton's Method. Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?Unit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.As far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.So that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.There's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an \"if\" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.There are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.Finally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.Testing systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",

Unit tests help catch that, if you have a test ensuring a log message is written properly.

Do you check the input before the calculation and exit gracefully?

What is the domainIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.Once there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.Second, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.Data processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you \"manually\" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.While 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.",

Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output. So you write a unittest to make sure if someone changes the function to fit their usecase they see that something else now is broken.>What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?Well again simple to understand/debug/modify code doesnt equal just one possible expected output.>And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.Thats something each dev or each team needs to decide on their own and depends on the projekt. Think about what happens if that piece of code fails and how likely it is to fail. If the code fails and people die you wanna absolutly test as much as you can. If you are using that code to turn on an LED on a personal project well no cares if it fails. For me personaly on the current project the goal is to have atleast a unittest so that every piece of code is atleast called once. So if you have an if somewhere in there (that depends on the input) you need two write two unittests so that both sides are called. >Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?Per function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail. But you also dont have to choose just once scope. You can do some unit test for functions, for groups of functions and the class at the same time.",

It simply boxes in the solution, leaving as little place for bugs as possible (but we’re only human).In some sense the tests are more important than the solution. You could keep the tests, delete the implementation, start from scratch and the tests will still ensure the new implementation works as expected and make the development even quicker than the first time. If your tests aren’t doing that then I would maybe have a rethink.",

The process of taking down requirements, thinking about trade-offs and improvising for a better solution is like a starting point. The same approach can be often helpful in building products. You may or may not use that knowledge directly to build fault tolerant systems but the skills you gained on how to think about a problem and judging trade offs is somewhat transferable when building projects/products.So both go hand in hand one way or another. But this is just a recent discovery for my own experience. I cannot generalize this. So yeah, this is my opinion (which may change as I learn more and gain more experience) Again DSA is not directly helpful in developing things for the most part. There are other skills that come into the picture but it is helpful in some way.",

When you merge, either you'll get a clean merge, or you'll get merge conflicts that need to be resolved.The key thing is that any new changes from the base branch may or may not matter for your feature development in that 4 day period. It depends. A major factor there is how orthogonal the team members are to one another. If people are working on completely different things that don't affect the other, then you could potentially defer merging the base branch into your feature branch until your feature branch is done, especially if it's pretty short-lived.Sometimes, you'll encounter merge conflicts when you attempt to merge the base branch into yours. Depending on what they are, I usually prefer to reconcile those sooner than later, just to not have that looming over my head, but even so, you could potentially hold off if they're not critical and don't affect how you develop the feature.In some cases though, even non-conflicting changes can be problematic, either in the sense that the code is no longer working (a semantic conflict, rather than a textual conflict), or they could just muck up your build in some way and force you to have to rebuild. In either case, if it doesn't affect how I'd build the feature, then I tend to defer merging until my feature is done, unless there's some good reason I should merge sooner.All that said, it's a judgment call, and ultimately you'll want to ensure that in the end you're merging quality work to the main branch that is well tested against the main branch's latest changes.",

But you should be committing and pushing often, and you don't want to push something incomplete into master.A minor change having a dozen pushes is perfectly fine. But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain. It's also harder to go back and figure it out.We branch from master when we start on a new major update. These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added. We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.When we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch. So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch. There can be two major branches, though it's not common. When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.When a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch. When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.This makes it very easy to keep things organized. If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.And commit often. Lots of commits make it easy to change your mind and go back to something you did earlier. It also makes it easier to put notes into a pull request, and to see what you have been doing.",

E.g. setting up hardware via registers (like a bootloader or OS would), using very specific features directly (e.g. hand-rolling SIMD like in ffmpeg codec impls) etc.The applications of reading it are wider, e.g. performance (where it matters at this level), verifying compiler output e.g. did you hit some UB and give the compiler carte blanche to \"optimise\" your code in an unintended way? etc.It's also not that difficult to pick up the basics if you already know how a computer works, so a skill well worth having if you're interested enough. You probably won't write anything in it at work outside of specific job roles.Edit to say: ARMv8 (and ARM in general) has slightly less historical weirdness and is easier to learn that amd64 IMO, if you want to buy a cheap arm SoC or you have a Mac with apple silicon.

One daughter who really loved \"programming\" in scratch took a Python class and decided coding wasn't for her. She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around. Don't get me wrong, the understanding kids can get from a tool like Scratch is helpful for things like understanding program flow and conditionals, but \"real\" programming--even game programming--isn't like that. I don't know how your particular nine-year-old is wired, but seeing what's involved in actual code couldn't hurt, IMO. So it's a chance to see if he's really interested. And plenty of kids play Minecraft, which isn't peak graphics, so I wouldn't focus too much on that.I think picking something relatively straightforward is a good plan. You might also make sure that you understand how all the libraries you'll be using work and have maybe tested them out a little (in case you've forgotten something since the last times you used them). It can be boring for a kid to sit and watch while you try to figure out how pygame's init module works.",

Without a strong prior foundation of maths, you're limited in how far you can go with programming.I'll give some examples:* The concept of *variables* builds on the concept of *abstraction** Designing 2D or 3D graphics requires understanding of *geometry** Working with arrays and collections of objects draws on *set theory, relations, and functions*You become vastly more capable of solving problems when you don’t have to worry about the underlying mathematical concepts. For example, if you’re faced with a *pigeonhole-type* problem, you can simply reach into your bag of knowledge for *combinatorics* and tackle it confidently.You don't need to be a genius. Failing to solve the pigeonhole problem doesn't mean you're dumb, you just lacked the necessary piece that you needed to solve the puzzle. I received a C in maths in school and would consider myself average. When I first started my undergraduate, I was very good at programming but my limiting factor was that my underlying knowledge of maths was lacking.I picked up one of those fat textbooks with a thousand pages on Discrete Mathematics and studied the shit out of that over the course of 3 months by reading and grasping the concepts, practicing questions and implementing knowledge. After I finished the book, I could shamelessly brag that I became a better programmer out of it, and not a single line of code was involved.",

I kind of suck in putting the button in the middle of a div or whatever. Styling stuff is not my thing. I can get it done but I would prefer a backend task.Just being a frontend developer will limit your options. Yes, there ARE jobs for frontend developers but in general it is more likely to find a job as a person who can do both backend and frontend.But if you did not mean frontend but web applications/services then focusing on that is a fine and valid choice. Sure, the job market is saturated with web application developers and you have to stand out of the dozens or hundreds of other fresh graduates, to get hired. How will you do that is up to you.

In Europe/US as far as I know, Python, C# and Java are still pretty common, Go, JS and Ruby (and rust) exist, but at different and lower frequencies, I have seen only very few Kotlin backends, even though I love how it is done in the language. If you want real numbers, go on job portals in your area, and look through a few hundred backend jobs. (Yes, it will take 2-3 hours, but you will have an accurate answer, which did not come from the subjective, 2 years out of date experience of someone from germany)2. I mean... Not sure what you mean? A Backend REST (or GraphQL) API will work for any frontend, as long as that frontend can do network requests. You can use the same backend for a python Frontend, a JS Webapp and an embedded C controller, and I have done so in the past. 3. You will have to learn the concepts of backend. This is not optional, and will be about the same amount of work for all of the options listed above. But once you know how it works and how to set it up, it works pretty much the same in every framework (+/-, different things will be included, there wil be different names and slightly different details). If you know what middleware is, or how a request/a form is handled, you can migrate frameworks pretty easily. If you don't know those things, you can't really work productively in teh backend. 4. I don't think that there is a huge difference between languages/frameworks here. If you want to shorten it, use a language you already know. (So I guess Java or Kotlin, if you come from Android). I have built a toy project in Kotlin, but never anything in Java. I can't really give you advice there.",

It's, after all, just a job, but it's also a job you will be doing for roughly a third of your day, every day.Being passionate helps a lot especialy if you want to climb the ladder and take leading positions, but if you're cool with just being a dev or engineer at an okay or decent salary then the only important aspect is that you keep somewhat up to date.It's totaly normal to feel burnt down and demotivated when dealing with difficult customers and projects throughout an extended period of time. But this specific customer or that specific project are not the job as a whole and it's important to differentiate that.I jumped into coding thinking itd be great to combine a hobby and a job but hobby coding is totaly different than coding and consulting for a company. Even if I'd like to continue to do hobby projects, the time I spend doing it for work is enough for me to not want to touch any IDE when the shift ends and instead do something else.And that's totaly fine. It doesn't matter if others say you have to X or Y. You just gotta find what works for you.",

The typical way to do it would be to drag and drop UI controls into a template in Visual Studio, then write little bits of C# code to hook them up. You could also do it in pure code and a Hello World GUI app would only be 20 - 30 lines of code or so.If you use Electron, you're basically building a web page using HTML+CSS+JavaScript and Electron runs an embedded web browser inside your app window. It will look like a web page inside of an app window. If you're already good at web development or you want to learn web development this will be very convenient. If not, it will feel more complex to get things up and running because you'll need HTML, CSS, frontend JavaScript, and backend JavaScript.Electron makes a ton of sense if you want a website and a desktop app. You can share most of the code. There are similar frameworks that let you build mobile apps and share a lot of the code too.Coming from Python and Tkinter, C# with WinUI will feel more familiar and just more polished and powerful. But if you wanted to build a Mac app, mobile app, or web app later you'd have to start from scratch.",

So to take your factorial number, what is 7! ? It’s 7 * 6!. n! = n * (n-1)! So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)def factorial(int n):return n * factorial(n-1)Now, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block. TLDR, when writing a recursive function, act as if you already have the function working",

Once you've solved a few of these problems, you've solved them all (for the most part).You can turn recursive problems into none recursive problems by pushing arguments into a list, and using a for loop instead, which is pretty much what is happening when you make recursive calls. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/159590/convert-recursion-to-iterationIn general the more you know, the more you make links to things you already know, and the quicker you can learn more - the hump at the start just takes persistence and putting in the hours, to get a basis of knowledge to build out from.

So much documentation to wade through. Although, LLMs can probably help with these things nowadays.I'm a C# person myself, and I love the language and the environment, I am most productive with it. I occasionally work with Python for scripting and Javascript / Typescript is a must when working with frontend stuff.

There's no \"special\" language to learn - just figure out what you want to build and learn the language that's best for that (e.g. if you want to make an Android app, learn Kotlin).To actually make a career out of it, you should get a 4-year degree in CS, because even though technically you don't need a degree, in practice it's almost impossible to get hired without one these days.I wouldn't necessarily call that an AI engineer, but some people would.A next level up would be collecting training data and training a new model. To do this you'd need to take some more advanced math (college-level linear algebra and statistics, at a minimum) plus many more of the college CS courses would be quite relevant and important. For this type of job, many applicants will have Master's degrees.A level up from that would be doing AI research - coming up with new models and algorithms. That basically requires a PhD.The languages you'll use will vary - probably some Python, some C++, maybe R. The languages will only be 10% of what you need to learn.",

Your job prospects would be very different.Generally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.Computer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. Since it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.To go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things. Keep in mind the job market for CS grads is fucked right now but that applies to data science too so given your age you might want to reconsider. I’m not trying to discourage you from CS, I’m a CS student myself, you just have less time to wait around for that six figure job. CS is no longer finish the degree and get that six figure offer right out of uni, it takes time and extracurricular experience now just like any other degree.In your position I’d look at r/cscareerquestions and decide if that’s something you’d be willing to deal with (it’s the worst of the worst scenarios but you get the point). Then I would say do a CS degree with a minor in data science. That opens all the doors: CS as a new grad, data analysis type roles, and grad school for either discipline should you want to do that.So yeah that’s my ted talk.Edit: I also unfortunately should say that with the job market getting a degree from a random community college or even a random state school won’t cut it anymore, prestige really matters now which sucks.",

In a CS degree you'll have the chance to make it more data heavy if you want but you may not get the opportunity to do the same thing the other way round. I don't think your job prospects will be very different. They'd probably be better with straight CS since it's more general but I also don't think a company hiring for a CS position would reject someone for doing AI and DS instead. They're close enough and you're probably taking enough shared classes between them that it won't make much difference.",

In the specific case of `gcc`, `-l[library]` is literally just searching a pre-configured (or specified on the command line) list of directories for a file named `lib[library].a` or `lib[library].so`. So as long as you know what your library files are named, you know what name to give to GCC.

Instead, build systems such as [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) or [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) are used, which can take care of this for you.

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.To reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.The linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. In order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for. You see, in their infinite wisdom, the people who created this concept forgot that it would probably have been a good idea to either keep the name of the necessary library files *in the header file* somewhere. Instead, you have to read the documentation to figure these things out yourself.",

You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is \"yes\", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you \"know\", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore. What you'll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.",

        "body": "I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.There are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:The code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.On the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",

Error monitoring in your production apps will also help you see when you've released a new error that wasn't caught by your testing.An incremental approach to upgrades lets you focus on one change at a time, instead of changing everything at once. This is safer and less stressful than trying to update everything at once. For example, many times when updating a library or framework, there will be some deprecated functions - like version 9 of some library contained theOldWay and theNewWay, and either one worked. Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changesOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",

The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.Then you execute.Sometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.You also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",

Images are basically just scripts to run the application. Kubernetes is a lot more complicated to understand but it gets pretty easy once you get to the heart of it. Services are what matter in kubernetes. They take the containerized application and assign an id to them. Since kubernetes deals with multiple ports if you were to handle it traditionally you would have to manually allocate ports to reroute traffic, however services work to reroute the traffic automatically to the assigned port of your application. If you want to practice you could probably use virtualbox to create a few vms and try to connect them.",

Solve some problems that require you to think algorithmically (Advent of Code is one of my favorites) and practice DSA with those questions and you'll be good. The key to learning DSA, in my opinion, is not just how to write an algorithm it in a programing language, but understanding the underlying concept. So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you're good to go and you shouldn't worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says \"sort this array using bubble sort\", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you're not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course. That's usually what I like to do, make sure I can analyze and explain the concept BEFORE I implement it in code.",

But I'd expect anyone who is a competent programmer to be able to sit for a second, think about what they need to do and what order they need to do it in, and then go and start working it out. Even if you never went to college and never learned about graphs, if you're decently smart and have had graphs explained to you, it shouldn't take you long to figure out an approach that works.Most DSA questions are really two parts - \"What approach will solve this problem?\" and then \"How do I implement that?\" And both come from practice.",

The features available in ARM7 aren't so overwhelming that you need to worry about advanced instructions you'll find in x86.As for fundamentals you want to make sure you understand - try to find some good resources that explain registers, addresses accumulators - it might be easier to start with a simpler microprocessor like an 8051/Z80, just to keep things simple and not overwhelm yourself.

If you're told to find the factorial of 1, it also can't help you, because there is no simpler problem.So write your program in a way that solves the problem, given that it has the magical other function to help: def fac(n): if n == 1: return 1 return n * magic(n-1)Then, just replace \"magic\" with your own function name, and you're done!",

At university in a single semester I built a raytracer in C++, had a hacking course in python and a parallel computing course in Java. It's okay. if you switch projects too often, they are probably too big. Start smaller, like go over old advent of code assignments for example. Then build something small: a calculator, tic tac toe, a web scraper that notified you when a certain youtube channel uploads. You are allowed to choose a new language for every project, but you must set a max amount of concurrent projects (I suggest 3), not switch the language during a project, and finish all of them",

You could compare/contrast the two. You could even make a blog post about if there's interesting differences. Regardless, you'll learn the data structure/algorithm/pattern, even if you don't become an expert in the two languages.I don't really have specific advice on how to focus on one language for a given period of time. Maybe there's psychological techniques you could apply or something?",

AI can slap together whatever I'm not interested in and I can focus more on the interesting parts of the code, which then again gives me motivation to spend 2-3 hours in an evening to pull together an entire project concept from scratch. Also it significantly reduces the mental strain of doing things.

I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of \"create a program that does X, Y, Z\" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of \"I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so\".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book. You need to put what you're researching into practice, without it, it won't do you much good.Good luck in your adventures",

You kind of design your classes with constructors and methods, while thinking: \"Oh, and it would be nice if I could just write code like ...\"Example:If you want your student-admin system to be able to be written like: Student student1 = new Student(\"John\", 13, 7); // John is 13 years old in grade 7. student1.takeClasses(\"English\", \"Maths\", \"P.E\", \"Home Economics);Then you need a constructor that takes just the name, age and grade, as well as a method for taking a number of classes.If you also want to be able to write something like: Student student2 = new Student(\"Jane\"); student2.setAge(14); student2.takeClass(\"English Litt.\"); student2.takeClass(\"Woodworking\");Then you also need a constructor that only takes the name - as well as a method for taking a single (additional) class and add to the list of classes.So there are rarely any right or wrong answers - you simply build your classes so you make it as easy as possible to write the rest of the code the way you want!",

Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by \"completely\"? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql \"completely\" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",

Knowing everyting else is just a bonus, but I can look up how certain commands work, or how I send a message over kafka: I don't need to know this by heart to be a senior!The way to learn this is probably just practice. You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: \"Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article. Let's open all models regarding bookmarks and articles, the endpoints files, the signals and start looking if we can find what we are looking for anywhere in there.\"",

This is connected to the fact, that the frontend is very visual. The backend works on data: You get a request, you react to that request ba returning data of some kind, often after running multiple layers of checks (authentication, authorization) and fetching data from a database. You might like both, but I would still suggest that you stay with frontend for a while, at least until you are pretty well rounded there. Afterwards you can try backend and decide, if you want to pursue both (fullstack) or even switch over to backend. You seem to have the best learning strategy already figured out: 1. learn a little bit of theory2. apply that theory and incorporate everything else you already know3. repeatIf you want something with a set curriculum, go take a look at the odin project [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) .

When starting out, this is the perfect way to learn.>Any must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?I would not waste too much time looking for a perfect roadmap, instead just continue with what you are doing.For example, now that you are learning HTML and CSS.I would also take a look at learning some JavaScript and jQuery.Look into using one or two of the CSS frameworks like CSS Flexbox or Bootstrap etc.And for that learning process, do exactly what you have already done. Find some information on these topics and then try to turn that information into working code. The things you create don't need to be big projects. Simple things will do, but it is important that you fully understand everything you create. That understanding is what is difficult, as you may have to spend time researching the bits that you don't understand.But if you do this for month, you should find you are suddenly getting confident in these topics.At that point, once you have that confidence, that is would be the perfect time to start looking for more advanced topics to learn. PS: Since you are getting into HTML make sure you watch a few videos using this YouTube search topic: **browser dev tools**.",

Is the website static or dynamically generated?The last question is probably the most important if there is no API. If the website is static (all content is sent upfront with the HTML), then I agree with the other commentor. I'd use Python, with `requests` to fetch the page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it to get the data out.If it's dynamic (Javascript is executed in the browser to fetch the actual content that you care about), that won't work. You'll need a tool like Selenium (basically, it allows you to control a browser via Python) which is capable of executing Javascript.You can tell how the site is populated by opening the dev-tools and comparing the Elements and Sources tabs. If the content you want is in Elements but not Sources, it's dynamically generated. If the content is in Sources, it's static. If you're comfortable with it, you can DM the URL and I can take a look at the site.",

I know you said that you don't want anybody to do this for you, but it's such a simple issue that it's a bit difficult to even point you in the right direction without giving you the answer. Others have suggested python, I'd do the same. Look into [requests.get\\(\\)] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_get.asp) then look into the [response you get from there] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_response.asp) and then just search the body for the name that you're looking for.Unless, again like others have said, the webpages you're scraping are dynamic. Then it's not as straightforward, but very possible and quite easy to figure out where the data is coming that you actually want to search using your browser's dev tools. Say you're visiting funerals.com or whatever, but the site actually fetches its data from funerals.com/funerals?start=2025-10-24&end=2525-10-25 and populates the website dynamically.Now you have the API (application programming interface) endpoint and you can just fetch that data instead of the whole website.Once you have that working, you can look into cronjobs or scheduled tasks, if you're on windows, to make your script run automatically at specified times and then look into notifications. Via mail, some messenger, SMS, whatever, so you don't have to remember and bother with running the script manually.",

One thing - once you learn any language be it c++ or java, learning the other would not take much effort.However, you can NOT go wrong with java. It is hugely used in industries, and in interviews you can always pick java and expect your interviewer to be familiar with syntax. Debugging in c++ may feel bit daunting with all the 'segmentation fault, core dumped' whereas java will say what is the issue.Also, in your other comments you have mentioned you know python already. You can go ahead with this too. Python has become quite popular recently due to it's simpler syntax and lower 'thought-to-code' barrier.",

To simplify: language exceptions are things thrown within the language by language statements, machine exceptions are things like \"divide by zero\" which are generated by the processor.There's then two additional pieces of machinery:- when a machine exception happens, the OS can pass it to the process to handle. On Unix this is done with signals. If there is no handler, the process will crash. - But if there is a handler, it can convert a machine exception into a language exception, which can then be caught. This happens in most managed languages - Python, Java, C# etc.C and C++ generally do not provide such handlers. Microsoft does have a mechanism called \"structured exception handling\" on Windows which lets you do this, but there's a high risk of the program ending up in an inconsistent state.",

When a method throws an exception, it does the exact same thing as if it were returning a value: it returns to the calling methodThe caller \"inspects\" the returned type - if it is a normal value, everything just procceds as it normally would. But if it is an exception, it breaks out of the try-block, and jumps straight to the catch-block. Kind of like you can `break` out of a while-loop.I like to think of the try-catch like an if-else, where the try-block is like: \"if everything goes well\", and the catch-block is like \"else do this\" - with the crazy change that you can break out of the \"if\" and jump into the \"else\", unlike normal program flow.I know that these comparisons aren't correct - but they do help me understand how to write the code, and what to expect to happen. Would be interesting to actually understand what really goes on, though :)",

The simple route is that the \"try\" key word tells your CPU to store a copy of its current state somewhere. If an error flag gets flipped after some error-raising operation (they typically store this in your eax register I believe), your CPU cracks open whatever buffer it stored that original state in, and copies all of the non-error-filled values, before effectively hitting a goto statement to the next valid catch block. If you don't have anything in that buffer, you crash. Alternatively, you can implement these using metadata handling, manually unwinding the execution stack to look for a valid catch block before jumping to it.",

If it means that the user-inputted number will always start with 1 and always increase by 1 until the final number, then you’re on the right track with n+1 but don’t really need a loop at all. Just look up Triangle Numbers.But is it possible the input doesn’t follow that interpretation of a “sequential number” and could be 234? Or 1679? If so, that formula won’t help you and you likely do need a loop. Since they’re not allowing you to cast to a string you need a mathematical solution. One that loops through each “place” (1s place, 10s place etc) and gets each value to sum together.IMO the question as you’ve described it above is a little ambiguous but I’m not sure if that’s how it was presented to you verbatim or not.",

So, i = 123, n = 3, and the result is 6.As you explained, it is n+1 more than g(2). In this case n is 2 and 2+1 is the 3 from above. The last number to add is just \"n\". However, there's a trick. More on that later.You could use recursion here, but that's not necessary. But just for fun:g(4) = 4 + g(3) Or more generally (for natural numbers): g(1) = 1 g(n) = n + g(n-1)Now it's just simple maths. I hope you like maths.g(n) = n + g(n-1) g(n) = n + (n-1) + g(n-2)g(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + g(n-3) If n is 4 then g(n-3) = 1 g(4) = 4 + (4-1) + (4-2) + g(4-3) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1OK, so far it checks out. But that didn't help. So let's so some more analysis:1 12 123 1234 12345That looks like a triangle. So, it's like a right-angled triangle with a side length of 5. Duplicate and flip it:1 54321 12 4321 123 321 1234 21 12345 15 rows with 6 digits. f(5) = 5\\*6=30 But we copied the triangle, so f(5) = 30/2 = 15It works with",

        "body": "The API is how programs make requests to each other. You usually don’t want to expose your program’s internal logic to outside sources, that’s just asking for trouble, so instead you define an API that lets outside sources make requests to your program with predefined parameters about what they can ask for, what data you need from them, and what they should expect to get back in response, and then you build a function in your program to parse and handle the request.Likely the most common implementation of this pattern is Rest API that allows your front-end web service to communicate with your back-end code. An analogy I like to use is ordering food at a restaurant: imagine if you went to a restaurant where there was no waiter, no menus, just a chef in the back kitchen. To order your food, you just yell whatever recipe you want to eat at the chef. If he knows how to make it, he will, although it might not be exactly what you asked for because you couldn’t see a menu to know that their version of grilled salmon comes with Broccoli while you were expecting asparagus, because nothing was there to tell you so, and you aren’t allowed to go poking around in the kitchen. And, if you ask for something not on the menu, the chef sends you back an empty plate. If you ask for something REALLY not on the menu, the entire kitchen might catch on fire. That is your code with no API, where the front end is allowed to just make requests to public methods in the back end.With an API, you have a more standard restaurant. The waiter (API client) comes out and hands the customer (user / front end) a menu (API schema). The customer now knows what is available to order, and what they should expect to get back once they place that order. If the customer asks for something not on the menu, the waiter can tell them “no” before that request ever makes it to the chef. And the chef, instead of waiting around trying to listen to 500 customers all screaming nonsense from the dining room and trying to pick up orders, can instead just rely on the waiter to carry valid requests back to him as a single point of contact. The chef also just needs to hand the prepared food back to the waiter and let the waiter take care of interacting with customers, instead of having to sprint out of the kitchen to drop food off and then rush back to handle the next request. And finally, say something changes in the kitchen — they run out of paprika and need to substitute chili powder, for example. Now, instead of the customer having to *know* that the chef is actually using chili powder and, if they order a dish with paprika, the whole order gets thrown out… they can just order off the menu like normal, and the chef is responsible for knowing “menu item #17 uses chili powder now instead of paprika”, make the dish, and send it back out. The customer doesn’t have to *care* exactly what spices are being used, just that they wanted a dish, had a standardized and codified way to ask for that dish, and then whatever happens between the waiter and the kitchen is a black box, but results in the dish being served to them.",

I mostly use AI as a whiteboard that talks back to me, I write out my ideas of architecture or pseudocode, and it does tell me certain details I may have missed, or things that I must consider, and for me it is the most useful there.Certainly it is true that optimization is a multi pillar task, and only one of those pillars is the code itself. In all honesty, if you find AI reviewing your code helpful, then that is awesome, that is what matters.

Do some free online courses, google when things don’t work. If you want to know how to actually understand whats going on and *why* stuff works… enroll in an online CS degree. Your senior engineers will appreciate your grasp of fundamentals.",

What you do in one language might be considered an anti-pattern in another. You need to learn the language specific ways.Honestly, don't overestimate your skills. Java is a great language with great libraries and a wonderful ecosystem. Your programming skills might be very good already, but still.If you switch to e.g. Python, you're entering a fairly different world. Sure, *programming* itself stays mostly the same, but the *approach* to *implementation* is vastly different to Java. In such cases, I commonly recommend to drop your ego and start with a beginner course. You can breeze through the early parts fairly quick, but when it comes to details and the \"Pythonic\" approach, you will quickly learn that the Java way doesn't translate well.",

Is UML the foundation of programming? Like the theory behind it, while Java or Python are languages that apply the theory in practice?For reference, the OOAD class is assigned as part of the requirements for my concentration in Management Information Systems. Don't know if that's an industry that's becoming outdated as well? Any insight on application and/or relevant careers regarding either topic in the modern world?",

But you can also draw the same diagrams using nothing more than pen and paper.>It seems like the most difficult thing about this is connecting the dots in your headI think you are over thinking it.OOD is about defining classes and also capturing the relationships between these classes and how interact with each other.For example, a class has attributes and methods, and you can show these details on a UML diagram as a rectangle where you list the attributes and methods of the class.Also, one class can have a relationship with another classes, for example 'has a' and 'is a' relationships are common. From memory, these are drawn on the UML diagram using solid or dashed lines.The 'has a' relationship can also be of differing types, for example 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to many' etc. Again, from memory, these can be captured on the UML diagram using circles, triangles and other symbols.The UML is just simple diagram that allows the OOD to be captured on a piece of paper. That is all there is to it.The harder part is learning the OOD itself, but that too is not overly complicated as it is about things like attributes, visibility, methods, abstractions, encapsulation, relationships, polymorphism etc.**EDIT**: I used properties in my description. Google suggests using the term attributes instead.",

The coding challenges on sites like these are structured / ordered in a way that's supposed to guide you toward the next thing you need to learn. If you encounter a challenge you're stumped on, it's normal and even expected that you'll do some research to figure out how to solve it. Now the key here is not to Google the entire problem, but rather just the parts or aspects you're stuck on, as this simulates how you would solve real world problems that can't be googled.For example, say you're tasked with sorting the letters in an arbitrary string, and are required to return a string with all the same characters but sorted in alphabetical order using X programming language. In this case, you might Google:- (1) how to iterate over the characters of a string in X- (2) how to compare two characters in X- (3) how to keep a count of every character in X- (4) how to dynamically create and add to a new string in X.You might even look up what the best algorithm or structure to accomplish something is",

Very devoted and motivated people will get the top jobs, and keep learning.However, not all problems can be solved by AI, and some AI solutions need to be debugged by good Computer Engineering techniques. We used to search the Web manually, then Google 'automated' the process. We currently write prompts for AI systems, or large statistical models for training them. These will be further automated, and the people who design the automation ... will use clever Computer Engineering techniques!",

Get it running and working first. > or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation. That's okay! It's a skill you develop with time. The way I approach this is, \"how does what I want to do differ from the tutorial?\" and most of the time I can kinda figure out a way to progress from tutorial to what I desire. > I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself that is an array containing points. It is always interesting to learn how a library works, but it's not _always_ necessary. Going back to your art example, I might know how to use a paint brush, I might know how to mix two paint colors together to get something new, but I might not know how a brush is made from scratch or what the individual pigments that go into a paint color are. Sometimes it helps, maybe one pigment reacts differently in certain conditions, and not knowing that might catch you off guard. But, it's not _required_ knowledge, most of the time. Good luck, hang in there. I remember feeling this way too, but I can't pinpoint a singular thing that got me over it. I think it was just stubbornness? I tend to go \"fuck it, IDC if it exists or if it's slow, I just wanna make the thing and see it work\". Slowly but surely, you start picking up new skills. At times they feel distinct and disjointed, but sooner than later they'll click. Another thing try is to view your initial idea document as just a guideline. You _think_ you'll use a linkedlist here, recursion there, etc etc. But when it comes to actually implementing it, you might find that your initial assumptions about the project were not accurate, and you'll have to adapt.",

And it has killed moral.With no warning, 15 people in our group were cut including the most senior and most expert (and expensive) in the group. He was the person who solved the big problems and helped everyone on a daily basis. Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.Why the \"layoff\"? - to improve the Q3 numbers. The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated. Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.It got so bad that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.The whole place just sucks. Everyone is now only about making their numbers. No help. No camaraderie. No extra anything. It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it. You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.Senior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping. Guru guy quietly says that management can't be trusted and will probably lay off again the when the Q1 slack hits. He thinks it will probably be him as he still makes more than most. But nobody knows.No one raises any issues at meeting. The life has drained out of the place. It was a fun an exciting job. The call will come just before your shift starts.Management lies at every call. They talk about the heavy forecast and how much work is coming. - Exactly like they were before the layoffs. They are probably just saying it to convince the people above them. Its such an obvious act now that you know to look for it.Keep your head down. Shut up, do you work. Spend your free time studying and looking for a better job. Don't make any large purchases and save every penny. Canned? No problem - you only have to compete with Phds, Masters, CCIEx2, FANG alums, and the entire continent of India with fake degrees and certs.",

It shouldn’t be possible for a company to casually lay off tens of thousands of employees. There should be regulation and oversight.

If you're going to lay off people, why did you hire them in the first place? It's because you don't know how many people you need to solve your problems. So you randomly hire a layoff people following trends, you do what your neighbor company is doing for fear of missing something out. You end up having companies where people are overworked because there's too few people and other companies that have too many people not having enough work to do.",

Also this isn't 30K engineers. We're talking TPMs, Design, Marketing, Growth, Analysts, Software Engineering, Hardware Engineering, Recruiting, HR, QA etc etc etc. A quick google shows that Amazon has 350K corporate employees in Seattle and Bellevue alone.Once you slice that 30K across all those job roles, across every country Amazon is in, the impact is practically zip. They're probably cancelling dozens of go nowhere projects and the staff along with it. In companies this large, there are probably 3 complete organizations of hundreds of staff all working on basically the exact same feature/product.There's no conspiracy here. Amazon can easily cut 30K, pump the stock price and make investors happy. That's it - that's all. There's no fuckin psyop here. The waste, redundancy, bureaucracy, politics that occurs in companies this big is insane. The something something AI stuff is just, again, mostly for wallstreet.There are projects that companies like this that have 300+ staff that end up going nowhere after investing 2-4 years in it and then are just totally shit canned and we never hear about them.",

People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.The reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.Going forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.With that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for. Any body that's spent their career trying to be high-impact/goal-oriented and developed a reputation and resume to match isn't struggling nearly as much right now.",

        "body": "Recent data shows job postings dropped by about 13.8% last month; therefore, finding stable work has become increasingly difficult. It’s not just AI or layoffs, the market is flooded with graduates while global uncertainty keeps shaking investments. Still, there’s work out there, just more fragmented across projects and smaller companies. Many have found unexpected roles. One friend in Germany started education consulting after a casual meeting and has been working remotely for six years. Another with a sociology degree became an accountant for a firm hiring across Canada, France, and Turkey. Not all paths are straight lines.To stay adaptable, it helps to build flexible income streams. Creating profiles on Fiverr or Upwork, keeping resumes [ATS-friendly](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumereview/comments/1jsb9a8/4_steps_to_creating_a_jobwinning_resume_resume/), and applying through sites like [hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.Cafe) that pull listings from company pages can make a difference. Following the [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) who contacted recruiter firms on Google Maps is another option. Some applications won’t lead anywhere at first, but eventually, there will be a response from somewhere. The market feels unpredictable, yet people are still finding their way.",

I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. Sorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path.",

To me anytime someone from a non FAANG company asks a leetcode question I just know they put 0 thought into their hiring process and probably have a revolving door of engineers. FAANG does it because they have 10s of thousands of applicants and teams etc. You are just copying them when you only have one product, you are not the same.Its like you said companies that don't ask leetcode or are smaller tend to pay less but they still pay well. I know tons of engineers clearing 180-200k working at companies you have never even heard of.",

Pay is shitty but would you personally take a job with shitty pay for swe?I was at a private non-tech company in a non-tech city working on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for 15 years It was my first job at out school in 2006 and I made 42.5K. At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.People will ask, why didn't you leave? The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking. The problem was my experiences didn't match the YOE or title at other companies.At the end of the day I was working at a non-tech company, their goal was pumping out features and meeting the bare minimum of FDA guidelines, not creating quality code. Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.I even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly. When management found out they literally told me \"if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all.\" The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.They were content with the speed of development, which was slow. They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process. They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.At the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained. I'm not saying ever place is like this, but that has been my experience which really soured me on working at companies like this. Sadly I'm not smart enough to get in to real tech companies, so I just have to deal with what I can get.",

I had a friend who worked as a pharmacist for 15 years as their main pharmacist. One day he showed up to work and there was a sign that the company had been sold and they were liquidating. Basically, what I'm saying is, don't look for the job that will make you feel comfy and safe, have good financial habits. Have a plan for if you do lose your job. Have savings. Have investments. Keep your eye open for opportunities, don't burn bridges, connect with people, etc.I'm not secure at Meta in the fact that I'm layoff proof, because I'm not, I'm secure at Meta because I'm confident in the network I've built, the skills I've learned, and that I have potentially years of runway to cover my bills, and that's without reducing my spend which if I was unemployed for a while I absolutely would tighten up the belt.",

Within a year of working as an SWE I was pretty much sure I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I hate the idea of the career and just focus on skills I can learn on the job and off. If I get laid off again, that's freeing tbh. Because then I can explore something else and it's not at the expense of me being worried I quit my job, I got let go. But that's also because I have no debt and a healthy safety fund. I've also interviewed for jobs that weren't even swe jobs but the domain knowledge from my swe gigs was very valuable to them. So become interdisciplinary early on or seriously make sure you understand whatever field you're in bc a liaison between tech and something else is invaluable.",

It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of \"look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.\"In short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",

(Yes I know that's what NDAs are for, but I've meet some really paranoid people in this industry). If I were you I'd try to downplay how many paying customers you've got (congrats on that btw, it takes a lot of work to get anyone willing to pay for an app and that number is not insignificant), and focus more on your technical abilities.Good luck on the job hunt, from the sounds of things you'd be a great asset for any company to bring on, and hopefully one of them will realise this.",

The question I am going to poke at is how well will you work on a team. What are some bad habits I am going to have to worry about? I am going to poke to see how arrogent you are, This followed up by how well do you take being wrong or pushed back on. Also see how well you will take being assigned grunt work. They are general items I always poke at but I poke a little harder on people who have their own apps as juniors as they tend to react more negatively to them and more concern about them effecting the team negatively more.

Until people start developing a sense of common cause among all their brothers and sisters who work (this \\*includes\\* commonly demonized people like H1Bs, Indian workers, people on temporary contracts, etc), instead of approaching it from the direction of \"but how can I get mine?\", talk of unionizing is dead air.I'm hardly a labor scholar but I think an important precondition is a shift toward cultural solidarity of workers over employers. The first movers here, as in any labor struggle, will likely be casualties. Workplaces will -- as has been happening -- retaliate. People will be fired and blacklisted, whole departments shuttered, etc.In the \\*absence\\* of a broader cultural context around labor consciousness, the lesson these retaliations teach is \"that was a bad move, you can't win\". Whereas in a context of solidarity, it is more acceptable to take personal risks to advance the greater good. You have to be willing to do things that might get \\*you personally\\* fucked, in order to advance the interests of labor, the common good, which I think most people today are very, very far from.",

        "body": "Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. First and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.Secondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. Thirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. Fourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.This is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.Other commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy. Don't get me wrong, this is a great idea but to do this there has to be a way to back industry into a corner without getting the economy fucked.",

They love their sweet paycheck that buys a nice house and an expensive car or makes their stonks go up. So they'll rationalize their contributions in any way that they can:- \"I'm a small cog\"- \"I work on a different product (even though I make the company money to do it's destructive work...)- \"capitalism means all corporations are immoral, and therefore all equally bad\"- \"I worked hard to get here, I *deserve* this\"- \"etc.\"If they interrogated any of these beliefs in earnest, they'd either have to accept that their choice of job (arguably the most impactful to the world decision that they will make in life because they spend 40+ hrs per week doing it for decades) is harming society. Or they'd need to quit and find something lower paying that does good for humanity (which is what I did). But it's easier to be a terrible person and bury the thought in luxury instead.",

We're all just following the money sources rather than breaking up these monopolies.

THAT’s when US hiring really boomed as did the salaries.

An executive's job is to run a section of the business, make it work well, and be accountable to its results.An executive's job security is based on how important their piece of the business is, how hard/risky it is to remove them from that piece of the business (either to replace them or reorg the function away), and how politically influential the person is (like who else will leave or become a problem if I fire this person). If your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security. The title means nothing. It's just about what power you have. Generally, the title of an executive is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. You are VP of eng because you are the person controlling eng. You aren't controlling eng because you are VP of eng. Where these are misaligned, the person with the title needs to be pushed out and replaced with who's actually in charge, and will be in any functional org. But who is actually controlling critical pieces of of the business is very safe.",

Now, for my own opinion, VP/Director roles don't get fired the same way. You get asked to leave and stay on payroll a while. Extremely senior roles actually have less equitable job prospects in the open market at any given point in time, and as a result most businesses will \"sideline you\" while you figure out your next move. Senior SWE? You can get interviews tomorrow for that. VP of software engineering? Takes time to connect to your network, make a role for you, or work into an existing hiring process. What it also may look like in a mass-layoff type scenario is that you need to layoff a significant amount of your team, then you \"get fired\". You would be critical in rebalancing the existing work on the new owners but consolidation may drive your role to be redundant anyway. You can't justify the scope of work or w/e.",

Those who aren't are asked to go back to IC. That also meant that directors with limited spans were asked to take on more areas, but I didn't see any directors laid off.I think layoff risk decreases higher up you go, but firing risk increases. As a manager or director, you're responsible for certain OKRs and project deliveries. It's inevitable that there will be some bad projects out there, either in tech talent of the team, bad product vision, or operational politics, only some of which the manager can control. The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.It's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially. At a certain level, you can negotiate your own exit package that is nonstandard. So, I think there's some second thought that always goes into laying off at higher levels because of that.",

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week. Being a good communicator is critical here (as in many big techs).PIPs do happen but you should give yourself some credit - passing the interviews and getting an offer is not trivial and it means that you have a good shot at succeeding.It opens doors for you career-wise in tangible ways (learning new skills) and intangible ways (brand recogniziton, relocation opportunities to the US, that kind of thing). Depending on your goals and lifestyle values you might find that it's a smart move. Good luck!",

You’re likely to evaluate the first more optimistically and the second more objectively. Every startup spins a tale about how it’s changing the world and how its stock is going to the moon. Theoretically, the current stock price bakes in all the assumptions about future growth. For the price to grow further, it has to beat those expectations. Also, consider the alternatives like public companies. Their stock and compensation grows too. Where I currently work, most people get excited about the stock price growth every time there’s a new 409a. But performance has slightly lagged the S&P 500 and many other companies.",

I mean, I totally understand what you're saying, but what you say to them sounds dismissive of the teams time, because they don't leave early, and it's scheduled on your calendar. You essentially just told them, \"I can leave when I feel like it.\"Think about the context - 'how would you handle situations where people argue'I think they want to hear about a situation where you actually handled it, because that's the person that they want to hire - someone who was able to manage the situationSo, if anything, now that you know that question can (and probably will) come up in a future interview, i'd prob be prepared with a diff story. If that's just what you do normally and don't really have a story that applies, then that's just how it is, should you make something up?Now that I think of it, a similar question that i've been asked is like, 'how do u handle a difficult coworker, or disagreement with a coworker'. Fortunately, in my career, those moments are few and far between. And that's what I express - but i still have to come up with something, i just have to tap into some really really old examples. My response is usually \"you know, i've actually been fortunate enough to work with engineers that collaborate very well together and so i can't tell you a definitive situation recently where our disagreement on xyz was so strong.\" And so i give maybe an old story and how i generally work it out, and really if things escalate to where it gets out of hand, that's what our manager is there for.",

H1-Bs are a good step, now they just need to tax flat +20% to any business that decides to contract overseas. Any dev shop needs to have a physical location in the states and virtual offices don't qualify.Until that happens then things won't change much but FAANG will certainly pick by up heavily, then following the rest of the industry; however, the only reason they'll be hiring is because they have to replace H1-Bs, which is a low amount of workers.Subsequently, if the Guardian catches wind they're just replace H1-Bs then they'll fire out propaganda against Meta so they want to avoid PR stuff. Therefore, a lot of people will be hired (not like COVID) but enough for you to get some. Unfortunately, unless AI burns and crashes (3-5 year reset, until LLMs are run onsite), then we won't have a true recovery, just slowly getting better.It'll be funny when AI startups realize how expensive it is to run an LLM with the latency of the big models. Nvidia will release their increasingly more powerful local LLM devices; however, the LLM computer will be more like a laptop you get at a company. Probably have some fancy case to put everything in and there are some distributed, blockchain-y kind of things you can do with them.That's why I believe these corporations are calling for back-to-office, not because of real estate money so much, but these smaller, compact LLMs need to be physically near each other to keep the costs the cheapest they can. Look at Morgan Stanley's updated trading floor, no elbow room.Eventually the LLM will be stuck in your head with neural link and you can really be a slave node at that point.

It sounds like you're not in the countryside, but cities generally have wood shops you can get membership or classes at. If not woodshops, there are metal shops, maker shops (like working with circuits and arduinos), and ceramics that are also very accessible.I don't know which city you live in, but tech heavy cities like SF and NYC both have a ton of options for makers shops, woodshop, metal shops, and ceramics for both memberships and lessons.There are reasons why so many people in the SF Bay Area make those huge art pieces for burning man as a hobby, because their tech jobs are soul crushing to them and they need an outlet.",

Both fields have their pros and cons, for me tech was more what I wanted to do and had a lot less cons.As far as electrical goes the pros are you will always have a job, you don’t need to worry about being replaced by Ai, you aren’t getting laid off and not finding a job (there are layoffs, more so in residential if the economy has a downturn but there are other jobs you can get quickly still). The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.The negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). I’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that. You aren’t in peoples houses and you aren’t messing with code stuff all the time and you have constant work, they usually get paid the best depending on the place.If you have any questions or anyone else does feel free to ask. Make an informed decision if you switch.",

Volunteer with an organization that builds or renovates houses (in the US, e.g., Habitat for Humanity). Help a friend who is an electrician do some work in their home or someone else's— not yours. Work in your own home is very different from someone else's, because the reward centers in your brain are different.I renovated my current house. I did 90% of the 120V work myself and 100% of the low voltage. I had some of the skills and watched hours of YouTube and asked contractor friends' input for the gaps. I fucketh not with 240V so my electrician FIL did that and the rest of the 120V that was a gap in my (electrical) code knowledge because I'd never wired a kitchen.While I enjoyed the work of running cables and changing outlets, it's physical labor that I couldn't see myself doing to bread on the table. It's something that I will enthusiastically undertake to help someone else.I'd recommend trying more development roles before exiting for skilled trades. Try a big company. Try a medium company. Startups can be rewarding, yet gruelling and a bad experience to some.",

My parents never believed in day-care, so went to great lengths to make sure at least one of them was always there for us. My mother used to go into work at 6 AM so she could leave the office in time to pick us up from school. My dad worked from home so that he could be there in the morning to get us ready and drop us off. Both compromised significantly - both by declining promotions, and by staying with companies that afforded them more flexibility over those that paid better. They turned down Google offers because it was known for being a very hard place to work at the time, so it's kind of funny that FAANG is seen as kind of a golden ticket these days.So long and short is that you will have to compromise - either in terms of career progression or not being with your kids - if you feel you're hitting your limit.

However all businesses have work hours and coworkers or customers might need you at work hours. Also you might have meetings at anywhere in work hours.So you cannot simply work 2-10 because you want to. That means nobody can reach you before 2, and you won’t make it to meetings before 2.In my experience permanent deviations from work hours usually require you have a special situation and need accommodation for that. Then your manager can arrange this and everybody knows they cannot reach you at some hours. And meetings that need to involve you are not scheduled to those hours. But even in this case 2-10 is a big stretch. Practically no company will support this permanently.I sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day. But this is usually more difficult than working regular hours. And I only do this temporary basis. Edit: Apparently this only makes sense for remote work. If you need to go to office at 9, there is no sense in not actively working.",

Might want to spend an hour or two a night getting ramped up on running LLMs locally and MCP/RAG for the agentic stuff as that’s where all the funding is right now, and you already have solid domain/industry experience. I know downskilling sounds like an attractive option but sometimes you just gotta put ten toes down and stand on business. There are plenty of hands on CTO roles out there looking for real experience right now. I’m not saying don’t try for the SDE roles but just pointing out there is a path where you can both get more hands on and keep a path in the csuite. Check out stuff like execthread and wellfound, and just know that recruiting for this stuff doesn’t happen on the normal channels so try to figure out what’s the best path in your ideal industry and what’s available around your local market as well.

Juniors don't get jobs becuase they are useful and make the company money, they get jobs because we all know we need juniors to skill up to become the next generation of seniors. B) Build Build Build. Pick a specialty you like, and start building large projects with it using popular libraries so you can get a feel for how it all works together. Focus on using the framework and libraries that the industry commonly uses first, you want those names on your resume and cover letter. >but I feel like machine learning is too competitive now I am not really a top programmer material The entire industry is competitive as hell, ML, like all CS, has roles for top talent hat make the **REALLY** big money, and roles for regular developers who are still learning or just want a stable job. When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. >What are some directions I should chase? https://roadmap.sh/machine-learningLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.Also, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. This youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschoolThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to \"learn\" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not \"intuitive\" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. And no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it. More of a \"thank you\" than anything else, plus I'll have it for my next job hunt, though hopefully leetcode questions will be fully gone by then, they're definitely starting to disappear which is nice.",

Aside from that based on your resume I'm assuming you are targeting web dev positions in which case I think you'd need to up-skill a little bit more. So doing projects that involve cloud infra or general dev op CI/CD pipeline I think would be really helpful. For example if a job posting goes up and outside of the basic \"must know javascript/react bla bla\" theres probably also going to be a line or two somewhere about knowing something in cloud like AWS Lambda and knowing some infrastructure stuff. Even for the \"SWE I\" roles. If a recruiter sees your resume and cant instantly draw that link for AWS Lambda for example they are likely to scrap it. Its annoying but that how it is with cold applying right now.You also have your degree in computer engineering, im curious to what job positions you are actually applying to. You should still qualify for early career new grad stuff along with internships which sounds like you are also applying to but have you tried stuff out side of the web dev space? Like embedded stuff/robotics etc? Heck honestly you could probably read a C/C++ book and open up a whole new world for yourself.",

So there is the duality of sink or swim pip culture and you can be put on a team that you have little interest or skills in. Imagine wanting to mobile/backend/frontend and you get stuck in security or data engineering for rotation. This system does has its perks that you can escape a bad fit the second rotation, and you get to try new things. But internally? There’s a lot of teams who hate TDP/Coda hires because they are basically assigned one and they can be a net negative. That attitude is awful in a pip culture because everyone already wants to save themselves and claim as much visibility as possible (first person to turn in performance reviews can claim milestones and others then have to go to extra efforts disprove them). Imagine being a senior engineer and you want to help the junior get up to speed but if you do, you likely going to get pipped for not delivering more of your own tasks. Years ago, they apparently counted mentoring, interviewing, and similar activities as a bonus point towards performance and now it’s almost a negative. Yes, yes. If you don’t end up in Card/similar, and get placed in Cloud in C1 you can barely do any work and not get pipped compared more competitive orgs (I know someone in cloud who admitted that they should get pipped but their manager is too lazy and finds it easier to just lie about their performance and cloud is less aggressive on pip).

Like theres realistically only so many of those that can be put out before people (initial recruiters) start catching on to that kind of fluff. That said participate in hackathons. If you cant or are not willing do that pick a few companies and roles that you'd like to target. Read the job description and find out exactly what they are asking for. build a project or contribute to an open source project that is based around that jobs needs. For example if you are applying to netflix streaming, it might be useful to either contribute to ffmpeg or build a quick wrapper application around ffmpeg. If a company is looking for someone to help with their AI/ML stuff it would probably be useful to make an AI agent.Most of the jobs/recruiters are just matching keywords and things that align with their goal.

At slower and bigger companies breadth isn't too valuable because they probably have experts in each domain who they'd prefer to leverage to do things more optimally. Also when it comes to landing interviews for all types of jobs to begin with, it's usually easier if you send strong signals that you're an expert in the tech stack that they'll have you work in as your main responsibility. The reason is, an expert won't have to catch up to speed and will be able to contribute at a deeper level (they know valuable stack-specific best practices and optimizations).EDIT: One hiring advantage you can leverage if you are a generalist is that you can probably build cool projects all by yourself to show off on your resume.",

It doesn't matter if you're the world's leading expert on some 10-year-old technology if it's obsolete.Conversely, being a hyper-generalist leads nowhere because employers want a person with depth in *something.* Nobody wants to hire a person who'd mediocre at everything.Personally, I aim to be a T-shaped engineer.

The only sustainable move for specialists to make is to get into leadership. Preferably as quickly as possible because the bottom can and will fall out. See the current status of Salesforce development for example.Contrast that to a generalist who gets paid less to start, but eventually they know so much there isn't really anything they can't do. Once you're 15 to 20 years deep studying become unnecessary because you have a total grasp on how everything works within the current architectural limits of computing. You can literally do just about anything at a high-level and weigh every pro and con from a technical perspective without needing to research anything.

Specialization can be added on top to fit into desirable roles after.The problem I see with a lot of specialist engineers, even mid-to-late career, is that they can end up being sidelined when things go wrong.Like a superstar front-end engineer who can crush React components, handle bundling and build systems and even has solid chops putting together a build system and deployment pipeline. But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.Specialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they \"own\" but fall outside their speciality.I'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other \"IT\" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.So ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos. I think that means you pretty much need to be a generalist early in the career, then evolving specialist knowledge in one or more domains as your experience grows.",

In the USA going home for lunch break is uncommon, nobody wants to stayt at work longer than they have to so most just eat at their desk and work and just do their 8 hours. Bosses will not be on your ass about that unless upper management says something. Especially in the jobs with bad work culture there is a lot of \"we dont expect you to work more than 40 hours \\*wink-wink\\*\" or other statements like that. The problem is when one person starts working over 40, gets the praises and the more people do it. When one person doesnt want to do it, they get questions like \"well why are you so behind you co-workers?\". Even if you complete the work required in 40 hours, tehy will compare you to your co-workers not was is expected of you.

Here are a few thoughts (just from one dev’s 15+ yrs of messing around):You did great figuring stuff out yourself. That takes grit, so don’t discount that.Zero onboarding + teammates treating each other like competitors = big red flag for long-term team culture. If everyone’s solo, you’ll keep spinning your wheels.Since you love the tech and are learning, ask yourself: Is the **pay + tech** enough offset for the culture cost? If you burn out or slide into isolation, the pay won't feel good.**Try this:** pick a small target for change. Could be *\"Meet one teammate for coffee/virtual chat this week and ask what their blockers are.\"* Or *\"Offer to pair on one small task.\"* If you get zero response, that’s an indicator.Keep the radar up for your next move. You’re already coming from a team with good support... so you **know** what better feels like. That’s strength.If it keeps feeling lonely and unsupported for 6-12 months, seriously weigh whether high pay + poor teamwork = “worth it” for you.Bottom line: you’re not stuck forever. You’re learning, you’re doing good work. If this place starts to eat your joy or energy in a non-recoverable way, it’s valid to move on again.Hope it gets better for you.",

Use some type of version control. Have a database, UI built out most likely in React. Set up a CI/CD pipeline, and have it deploy to AWS (there is free tier). Bonus points for user authentication. You’re not showing you’re a rockstar, but you’re showing competence and relevance for most full-stack dev jobs. You can add complexity to system as needed for experience level. Deploying to a dedicated server is different from making use of cloud services or other platforms.",

Couldn't get out of bed, zero energy, absolutely fatigued. This went on for months. I got lucky with a month-long PTO, but still felt burned out for months after. I was convinced leaving was the only option because I literally couldn't function at work.But I didn't leave. I stayed and did the bare minimum to survive at work. Started prioritizing rest and self-care, even if that just meant more time in bed. Recovery wasn't smooth, but I feel 1000x better now.My 2 cents: this might just be temporary. I don't think you need to leave your company (unless they fire you, can't control that) or switch fields. You need to make space for yourself. You're talking about suffocating every day. I felt that too during burnout. Maybe you just need rest. Or maybe there's mental pressure you're putting on yourself to maximize this opportunity because of your background, and that's making everything worse. I don't know, I'm not in your head. But whatever it is, try to lighten the load wherever you can and keep going, even if that's half a step at a time, or sometimes zero steps.If going that slow for right now isn't acceptable to your company, then let your manager fire you. Health is important too in life. Don't push yourself past what your body can take. If it's burning out, you need rest, and the severance will allow you to do just that.",

This isn’t an “I’ll TRY and have this fixed…” type of thing. You’re a professional, in a professional job - you should have began this by having an attack plan with set deadlines. Ingest the data and get the report could be step one. Step two find the problem and FIX it. Step three maybe do a thorough investigation to see if other data is being missed. Step four have a test suite or some way to monitor so this scenario doesn’t happen again. If the urgent steps are not completed by noon on X day - you’re going to contact the manager or team lead and bring in help. You’re also actively communicating the status of these issues during standup / keeping your manager updated. Also - if you know you’re doing dumb stuff then you need to stop and take a step back.

You may have been the first fuck up, but they're the people who could've prevented it, and who are in charge of recovering from fuck ups. *Their* fuck ups are making this a more serious issue than it should've been.Take solace in the fact that this isn't *just* your screw up. It's a team effort. When things go wrong, a healthy team will have a sit down and think what they could've done to prevent it and make recovery easier. The company having neither of those things at the moment isn't your fault. You're just the match. Someone else poured gasoline all over the floor and turned the water off.",

I doubt you can get hired in embedded. You don't have a computer engineering or electrical engineering degree, no actual coursework or relevant work experience.

I recommend taking a university course or two that covers embedded systems that's graded and will force you to learn and not jump around and skip the fundamentals. Know basic C or C++ first.

There's no flexibility because it impacts A,B, or C. The alignment if I _don't_ ship by then is that I have poor support and turnaround time, and likely damage stakeholders trust, but if the code is mostly well tested, then I _might_ damage partner trust. It seems pretty clearly positive EV short term to not burn my partner team. What they say will impact my bonus far more than someone later worrying about an edge case.",

So, you need more time than just the time to develop the MVP.On the other hand, if you spend forever trying to make something perfect, you might never actually encounter the real problems that you will experience when this thing goes live, and ultimately, it does not matter if it is perfect to the business if a slightly less perfect thing could generate 80% of the value in 20% of the time.So yes, refine your work, don't cut corners, but make sure you actually ship something and get feedback on it quickly (in a safe environment, not production). Taking either of these approaches to their extremes lies madness",

I started developing websites from start to finish, creating more complex APIs and data pipelines, and working closely with outside companies and onboarding their users to our flagship application.My advice? If you’re having trouble finding another job, but you have the flexibility in your current position, starting looking into creating bigger projects for yourself.

You buy your servers from Dell, HP or similar and then rack them. That's then paid rather than paying $$$ to AWS, Azure, GCP or similar. Cons are that you're limited on what hardware you have deployed - you can't just spin up more hardware quickly. Also you'll be responsible for maintaining this hardware, and the corresponding operating systems etc on it. It can be cheaper, but the overheads mean that it's not necessarily a simple choice, in particular if you need to hire co location space etc - all of this adds up quickly.For what it's worth, I'd go for cloud first and only go on prem if there was a very good reason for it, and that all of the points I made above had been considered.",

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool. Probably worthwhile to keep the client-supplied data in a different database for posterity.This is pretty basic first-principles stuff but I’ve been shocked how many people don’t do this kind of thing",

So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me overThis is what *every single person* who has been fucked over by family has said. You're literally playing into the trope. Nobody loans someone money thinking \"This person sucks, pretty sure they're gonna fuck me\".There's 2 very different questions baked into your post. One is how to bill yourself. The other, and one you're neglecting, is doing business with family/friends.Go ahead. Google what doing business with family/friends is like. No matter how good my sister's tech idea might be, in no world would I ever consider working for her. Same for my friends. My friends are very smart, they have lots of good ideas. But we're friends. Not co-workers. That's why I'll never in a million years do *any* sort of work for them.It's very well established that you should never do business with friends/family. And if you do, you should do so expecting to never be paid. You're working for free. If you expect to be paid, you should not do the work.For the other side of the question, you mention you have an aversion to an hourly wage..... why? There's a reason that's what a lot of freelancers do. There's lots of hidden costs you don't think of that can pop up during a project. It's really tough to just say \"Yeah, just pay me $X\". If any of a million things come up, $X suddenly turns into $X+$10k. Now you're out a bunch of money because you tried to do an upfront cost versus an hourly rate.As for the actual rate, a lot of SWE's tend to charge $50-100 per hour.",

He probably solved that problem countless of times before so it's straightforward to him. If he has been working for the company a long time, he is also much more comfortable with the codebase than you, naturally. You will get there eventually, don't stress out about it.I don't think you should log in during your PTO or work every weekend. That's a sure way to burn out, and your performance and focus will get even worse. Do other things, have fun, refresh, have hobbies.Also, maybe the stories that you get assigned are hard for your current level. A lot of companies don't even want junior developers, and don't know the appropriate level of tasks that they should give them.If you are always given tasks above your level, then you will always feel like you are not enough. It's all relative.My only advice would be to ask more questions and ask for help earlier in the task and not wait until the end. If you are unsure about how to do something, ask for advice or \"how to do it well\" or \"the best practices\" for such task. When you want to discuss your task with your senior, study your task very well, understand the code you wrote, and **TAKE NOTES**. Don't try to remember everything in your head if you can't. I always brought my notebook during meetings when I had to talk about my tasks and code and referred to it when needed.Good luck",

They have reminded me that it's normal for me to be slower than my teammates, it's normal for me to struggle or have knowledge gaps, and it's normal for me to ask for help. My work is valued by the company even if it isn't as impressive as the work being done by industry veteran wizards.>“I don’t even know how to help you.”That's your \"Team Lead\"?

Maybe you *do* suck at the tasks you're being assigned, but that might just mean your lead sucks at assigning you appropriate tasks.It doesn't sound like you're incompetent, but it also doesn't sound like you have imposter syndrome. It just sounds like you have a shitty boss that isn't facilitating or recognizing your growth.I would just keep your head down, do your work, and shrug off the shitty attitude from your boss.

Usually it's around creation of artificial scarcity in raises, promotions, etc that drive this behaviour (which, ironically is super self-defeating for the company).Why did this senior just take the ticket and do it for you?

If you are pressed odds are they are even more pressed. \\- Show your work, this is key. WHen you finish a task, ask for 10 minutes post stand up and show a video or show your work.

My company provides cloud certification courses so I am doing that on side along with my work and each module covers different things. I have tried going into more details while doing labs and learning more about devops stuff like k8s, helm, docker etc., I have also started going into more details in computer networking since the next module covers that and my work required some low level debugging so I spent a month reading more on OS fundamentals and now my task requires some AI knowlege so I'm planning on reading up more on that too. I have learnt more in this one year compared to what I learnt in 4 years of university combined. I like reading and working with all of this but Idk what topic or domain I should go in depth to gain mastery level knowledge. How do people decide this when they are early in their careers?",

When new roles are available they make that list available to all those agencies. At that point its a scramble to contact anyone who fits the JD. So if its a recruiter that's been in the game for a while, they have a bunch of candidates they've contacted before, or they already know where to lookIf its someone who sounds a bit new, they send that initial contact msg and if you aren't responsive thats when they keep pressingSo not sure if you've noticed but sometimes you'll get hit up by different agencies where the JD is eerily similar if not identical minus the usual text replacements. It's because it is in fact, the same role for the same companyIn either case, if you don't get any response, some other candidate likely already bit, and they've submitted them for the role (obvi they can submit multiple candidates) but you can see that you've got a better chance the sooner you respond to their initial contact. Maybe you did, but maybe there were also 10 others and they chose to go with candidates that gave them (the recruiter) better chances for selectionI've mentioned this several times before with regards to recruiters - we're just race horses. If you show promise, they give you all the attention, because they're betting all their money that you get selected for the interview process and hopefully all the way to an offer.If you're behind, or lacking, that's when you get ghosted. They might even come back to you when a different role becomes available, because they remembered you replied the last time. You just gotta be quick, and cross your fingers",

The only reason I am asking is because I relate to what you describe A LOT and I understand that most of the other commenters do not relate to this experience..I also work with a team that is mostly HK/Singapore but I am in the west. It's tough. And some people can be very condescending and difficult to work with. I found a new job in the country I currently live in for this very reason and I will give my resignation very soon. Just remember, we are always being held to higher standards when it comes to technical skills. Because their assumption is that we are just not as technical as them. They don't do it consciously and if you mention it to them as a feedback to your manager they will 100% get defensive and you will come across as \"oversensitive and blaming them for sexism instead of responding positively to their feedback\". But it's been my experience, my friends' experience and I ve seen it countless times.There have been times that I saw men in my team doing things in a certain way and their PRs got merged. I tried to use their approach and my PR got scrutinized. I try to just stay on the facts, avoid making any accusations, just sharing code snippets and say \" we used this approach here, how is it different now?\". Most of the time, they don't have an answer.Just try to look at your output objectively. Are they really right to what they are saying? If not, try to remind yourself that your output is just being scrutinized much more than theirs. If yes, try to improve on the things they are right and also document what you worked on/what you did to improve. I also found that these issues significantly reduce when I work in teams with a more balanced gender ratios. My current experience at this job, has been really extreme and it makes sense since I am literally the only woman in a team of 15+ people.I wish you good luck! :red_heart:",

It’s hard disconnecting from work when I’m told explicitly and implicitly (people cutting me off) that I’m not doing well. It’s a hard cycle that I’m trying to break. And to be clear, the firm pays me well enough that I feel like I should care more.But you’re right. The cure is finding something else I care more about. Thanks :)",

You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.I don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.Think of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. Once you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. It really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience. Do what you need to sustain a living and be sure to socialize, exercise, and eat well to keep your mental health in good shape too! Good luck.",

A lot of our stuff is internal, so its gonna be new anyway. I think just have a good foundation, and learn on the job is the best. For the job part: If you don't have the job or interview, focus on getting the interview. if you got the interview, focus on passing the interview.Worry about the not knowing things part after you get the job. Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. Once you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.I didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.Need to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.I don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools. But my personal opinion is that you use it to augment your learning potential and gain experience. Once you have more experience, perhaps you can use it to vibe code or output tons of code. Because at least, you tell tell if the output is good or bad.",

        "body": "The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.Larger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.The more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.I wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than \"Write some code to do X\", focus on \"How do I do X\" and try to understand the underlying concepts.Also, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!Got a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.Funny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like \"I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!\" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.Funny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.So back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.So learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to. You'll find some surprising things there too, I think.",

And then I was assigned to use their solution, their un-modified solution failed to actually solve the problem I needed it to solve, and I did my best to deliver my part of the project and then resigned in contempt for the leadership of my team. And in my engienering handoff meeting, as I was resigning, after my project had been impacted by this deficit in their design, I mentioned again that it was not fit for the purpose it needed to be used for.

Life goes on, they just didn't have to take any responsibility for failing to deliver something which solved a problem and engaging in denialism for months.Anyway, I suggest you ask these people plainly if their commentary is contributing to someone taking responsibility for solving a problem, or if they are generating commentary for some other objective, and figure out whether their commentary is making measurable progress toward that objective. They will probably say that they are trying to contribute valuable implementation details on *how* to solve the problem, so you should be ready to ask if they are sure that their comments are commensurate with the prioritization of problems that we have; because it might be that commissioning a smaller group to solve the problem is a lot more effective than sitting as a group talking about details that are germane only to a subset of people.",

Jusk for clarification, if your colleagues aren't dickheads, then they will be fine with a non-native speaker asking for clarification, do that enough and hopefully they learn to be more concise too.Also some people also just love to hear themselves talk, also some people have work as their whole identity so you may be some of the most exciting social interaction these people get all week.",
