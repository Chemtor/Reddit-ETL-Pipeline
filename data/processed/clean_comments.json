Say no and politics start \\- vendors make apis like shit, because it's cheaper to hire an idiot and expect all the users to adjust. Some don't even want you to take the data out and make it hard. (stripe api is an exception, i give it as the positive example)That being said i enjoyed the work because it empowered companies to make change.When i designed dlt the whole idea was \"get back your mental sanity as a data engineer\" - no more schema change breakage, no more mystery schemas or change requests from the team, load everything with high quality and let the SQL folk handle it downstream as they want. Hope you are using dlt and that it helps.",

What’s crazy is that same study finds that switching leads to more promotions as well. I think there’s nothing wrong with telling them they are hiring at wages higher than you’re paid.

I am in same situation and the simple answer to this is \"It's time for a new adventure, either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.\"Further Details of my past couple of weeks- I'm an 8-year experienced Data Engineer who has been working at the same organization for the past three years. I was quite satisfied until I was asked to conduct technical interviews for few of new future team members with 4-5 years of experience each. The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.Last week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience. However, both candidates turned down the offers, requesting better compensation. The salary they rejected was approximately $11,750 more than what I currently earn annually. I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?This revelation devastated me. When I discussed it with friends, everyone told me there's no point trying to negotiate a raise with my current organization. They advised me to either start interviewing elsewhere and leave, or only discuss a raise when I have a competing offer in hand. According to them, there's no easier alternative - either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.Most companies show no empathy toward their employees and view them merely as workhorses. They constantly test boundaries, seeking maximum returns for minimum investment.",

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.And yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change. An example of this would be databricks workspaces with exact same naming for database objects for each individual environment and when you deploy to other environments you just ensure the target workspace is where the code is being deployed. Hope this helps!",

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models. All that said, when it comes to raw ingestion, python notebooks or dlt pipelines are still the way to go. I don’t have any experience with snowflake, so can’t help you there!",

Strong problem solving skills, solid sql and the ability to learn on the fly, and a focus on helping people solve their problems are important. I don’t care about your side project you built just to be able to say you used airflow. All that tells me is that you probably don’t know airflow very well. And it hints at low understanding of anything else on your resume. This is especially true at start ups where the goal is to make money not to build some ideal data platform. The most successful company I’ve been a part of has gotten pretty far with Postgres and cron running some python here and there.",

Sometimes, the best practice/approach to be taken in a certain situation, is the most obvious/simple one.For instance: Let’s say that you can build a simple stored procedure on pure SQL that solves a problem or creates a temporary dataset of some kind - Sometimes this would be much better than wasting dozens of hours creating a python pipeline that would take 2/3 times more compute/resources, and would end up by delivering almost the same performance, sometimes would even run slower.All I’m saying is that sometimes we focus too much on the tech outlook of the thing, when what we should be doing was to be thinking on the simplest way to solve the presented problem.",

Since the ask was to just do a review and drop in a few additional data sources you're given far too little time to render it in any acceptable state between the choices already made on the frontend and a legacy framework that doesn't let you do anything out of the box.So you're left with working way too hard to do basic shit like implementing code in a repository and not running production dashboards on a sandbox environment because they thought that engineering really didn't need to be involved earlier on in the process. While yes, conceptually what you've outlined does make sense the reality is that in the majority of organizations data engineering projects are at the whim and mercy of many different people who don't really understand what exactly is involved. It's often a process of trying to figure out the best enough way forward with the time you have. Big companies often grow these systems organically and incrementally, so you're making decisions based on the tooling available now.All that to say that the data modelling and flow is relatively easy.

Then we even added methods that would make the object prune rows that were not present in some related tbl. such was business need. and the surface code was much less verbose than without the oop. easier to read.similar with FP: e.g. you need to applt some transfornation to all column names in a df, write a function that takes another funcion and applies it tobthe names. now you can focus on the transformation logic without worrying about mechanics. you can also unit test both without actually querying for the data frames (make substitute objects that present column names similarly ad df do).edit: sorry for typos. my phone kbd too small for my fat fingers",

And the project has been actively maintained since then with bi-weekly kubeflow calls and even a release 2 months ago. > In May 2025, the Apache Spark Kubernetes Operator launched as an official subproject Kind of. The first formal release just happened, but it was launch as an official subproject in 2023 ([voting thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/wdy7jfhf7m8jy74p6s0npjfd15ym5rxz)) and the first commits happened [a few months later](https://github.com/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator/commit/eddc7e6bef0c270f5d3f3bbe0aef83e77cb2d5ba). > Core maintainers say they might converge APIs eventuallyThey do? One other huge difference this article doesn’t mention is the kubeflow operator is Go (like most operators) and the Apache one is Java. This has the benefit making the Apache one more performant as it’s not shelling out to `spark-submit` and starting a new JVM for every job submission. But the Apache one is missing some good metrics, the Prometheus output doesn’t support tagging, and the SparkApplication resources have to be manually deleted (causing problems at scale if you don’t).",

And regarding Go vs JVM - we try in Big Data Performance Weekly to not be fluff, but also not to be too technical to make big data performance available for everyone :)",

The Kubeflow Spark Operator team [posted some nice benchmarks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/spark-operator/performance/benchmarking/), but the tl;dr is that if you hope to schedule more than 100 jobs per minute, doing so on the Kubeflow operator will be a challenge (though they're working to address it). re: timelines, maybe it's just the wording could be more explicit? I've been testing the Apache operator since late 2024 so it's definitely been launched, but only just published the first formal release. But for the Kubeflow one, you have a header that says `The Kubeflow Era (2018-2023)`. But the operator wasn't donated to Kubeflow until 2023 so that just jumped out at me.",

That's what the \"git submodules\" thing makes me believe is going on.My advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects- projects can share Airflow-level utils- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime- external DAG dependencies- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together- less magicSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.From there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.External systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).Also, never ever use git submodules. You can either take my advice right here right now, or you can waste your time and learn the hard way.",

As others have said:\\* adds valuable cred to your resume \\* you may have the opportunity to work with some really great engineers (don't waste that) \\* bigger money early on to put into investments has outsized impact later on due to market growth. You can never catch up by investing later in life to what you will have if you invest now. \\* in-company raises are almost always % based. A 3% raise on $160k vs $120k, and potentially yearly going forward, adds up over time \\* negotiation leverage at your next job for a higher starting salary if you are switching from making, say $165k vs $124k or whatnot. I love the advice someone else gave about taking feedback well and doing your best to learn from it. I think humility, curiosity, and willingness to learn are some of the very best traits you can have. (the humility to graciously admit when you don't know something, or when you are wrong, will pay off in spades over time as you grow)",

If you run your ingestion on a Saturday morning and tie the date to the Saturday, then the business is going to be quite curious why sales numbers are so high on Saturdays when they are closed, and so low on Mondays when they are open.You might need to track when the data was ingested, so you can verify what the state of the data was when some process was run. Without that, you may get a bit lost of source data arrives out of order, or is late to arrive, or is skipped.Storing both in an append-only table is a very simple way to be able to do *anything* you need with the data. If you need to refresh or reprocess some ingestion then you can do so - all following processes just use the latest technical timestamp for the given business timestamp. You still have the old copy if you need to see what the differences are between the two. Things can be loaded out of order, and you can determine exactly what kind of processing you need to do for downstream tables.Don't mix the two up because, as NS1969 said, *they mean different things*.",

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be. I always thought in my previous career \"well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine\". It never happened. I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience. And it showed.When it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time. I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there. Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, \"Make sure you sort out XYZ\" before I had time to think about it.On top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.My recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own. Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more. Making mistakes and being imperfect is part of learning. I'm a firm believer you don't need a mentor and most people who say you need a mentor are, ironically, mentors.> Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?Mostly surface level. I went to a large one in Europe and my manager joked at the time \"Remember: you are all happily employed\" because it was a running joke that the conferences are just for companies to poach from other companies. I enjoyed the community aspect, learnt a few things. Won some competitions. Getting paid to have fun in a new city is fun.> Any learning paths or courses that helped you understand more than just what works but also why?Honestly? Teach yourself, be willing to learn (as in, be wrong and improve rather than be wrong and convinced you'll be right the next time with exactly the same approach). I'd also say don't chase tools, learn concepts instead as it saves you so much time. Be curious. Be patient - there is no other way to put in 10,000 hours other than putting in 10,000 hours.",

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can’t be generated, that would be counted as downtime.Hope this helps. Evaluating the success of a Data Engineering team can be tricky because there is a lot out of our control so whether it is fair or not, we have to play what I call “a lot of defensive” to ensure we are in a good state. But once you get the above 3 down, you can then maybe target something like how fast you can “onboard a new feature”.",

So I think it could be useful where: \\- A: you need to interact with non-technical staff\\- B: You need controls (e.g. security, special data processing rules, high complexity) that warrant implementing via code and having that version controlled-- think GDPR compliance on automating marketing data workflows.\\- C: The data you are working with relies heavily on 3rd party connections (e.g. CRM data from Hubspot).I'm still exploring, so would love to hear what others are thinking, but I think it's one of the best tools out to build quick AI workflows while having some form of version control and staying on a local machine.",

Reliability-wise, my experience has been mostly positive, but it's crucial to implement robust error-handling mechanisms.For integrations with AI/ML, anomaly detection workflows were practical, assisted by built-in and external AI nodes. However, you'd get more flexibility with custom pipelines using other tools. I've also tried Apache NiFi and Airbyte for ETL, but DreamFactory stood out for API integration and management, which could enhance your ETL stack's capabilities.",

You can set up error workflows to capture and send errors to a logging service, and also store general execution data in this logging service, but if you have a staff capable of managing this why are we using low code? In my org the people using N8n don't do this. I'll get slack messages and then have to comb through the GUI's very limited execution log screen.People also use it for use cases where it's not needed because they don't know any better (e.g. scheduling a query in your warehouse). You can probably tell I really detest working with it and look forward to not dealing with it at whatever my next job is.",

You have to first ask yourself: why is it important and/or useful for me to organise this? What benefits do I hope to achieve? Answering those first will give you some guidelines on what needs to be done. Then from there you can pick specific techniques. Though it's important to note that having a 'random stuff' drawer where everything gets put in with no sorting can actually be useful since it cuts the cognitive load of having to sort things. If you haven't found a compelling reason to organise it after 15 years then it's a strong indication that you either don't have a strong reason to do it, or the system you currently use - albeit informal - is workable enough.Ok now I get to put my autistic hat on: As an autistic person I have at times enjoyed organising things 'for their own sake'. Whilst it's been fun and I learned a lot, the end results were never anything \\*that\\* useful. If you're anything like me then just be aware of it. It's fine to spend time and enjoy the process but be cautious about any perceived future benefit.The system I like best for lots of random stuff is the PARA method. You can start by dumping everything into one big 'archive' folder and then either move things out one-by-one into an organised place, or you can move things ad-hoc when you 'touch' them. e.g. if you find yourself needing to use an old python script or look at certain docs, then make sure to move those into the organised structure when you do so.",

I realize every data point that exists reflects most of what the company will have in the future.I’m trying to gain insight out of it. Typically we know how much a project goes over budget, or done 4 months later yet the fine points of why or just data itself with years of specifications etc. I guess that’s the reason for the ask I conceptually understand how it can be organized in the future just not how to untangle this mess the best way",

SQL will help but data engineering can require experience across a broad scope of systems depending on the role and will require significantly deeper understanding of software engineering best practices. 4. The market (at least where I am) for data engineers is very up and down at the minute. On the whole the salaries are typically much better but the definition of data engineer varies quite a bit between businesses and a lot of business do not see a huge amount of value in data engineering as a practice. For now at least I think data engineering is in a decent spot but I can’t promise that will continue to be the case.",

It depends, if you’re a legitimate DE then it would be more technical unless you’re a pipeline monkey. You typically have to have advanced knowledge of SQL and some programming language. Tableau would not be a very convincing Transform skill as a DE like it would be for a DA. You’d be better off learning dbt, Python, or Spark.4.

        "body": "Your learning repo idea sounds awesome, and it's great you're integrating real-world tools like Airflow, Azure, and Snowflake. Having explored ETL and orchestration myself, I found it super helpful to simulate real business cases, like creating a sales data pipeline for rapid analysis or a financial transactions data warehouse. I've tried using Azure Data Factory and Databricks for batch processes; they’re great for handling data transformations. Also, you could check out dbt for enhancing your data transformations.DreamFactory could also be valuable, especially for automating API generation and management, which could be beneficial for building integrations in your projects. Incorporating Apache Kafka and PySpark in advanced projects really sets the stage for handling massive data flows and real-time processing. Can't wait to see how this develops.",

One thing that really helped me was focusing on real-world problem-solving rather than just theoretical concepts. Try to frame your ML and GenAI projects around actual business challenges – it'll make your skills way more relevant in interviews.For metrics, I'd suggest tracking your progress on coding challenges and your ability to explain complex ideas simply. That last bit is huge in interviews. BTW, I actually created a resource called Experimentation Career by Atticus that dives deep into prepping for data roles. It's helped a bunch of folks land jobs at top tech companies. Might be worth checking out if you want a structured approach. Good luck with your prep – you've got this!",

Even if you could inject the source data in a more clean way either via a seed or passing in data like a test would, the output is still going to go to a table which you'd have to retrieve.

This is what this is for, of course it gives back data and won’t generate views in your warehouse.If I was to do this (and I wouldn’t) then I’d think about it as such.0. First up you wouldn’t make this synchronous…so we will need a queue like SQS.1. Rest endpoint in whatever framework deployed with API gateway and lambda2. When the request comes in the lambda writes a request to our SQS queue3. Fargate listens to the SQS event and executes a dbt run where each variable specified gets passed as args into Jinja e.g ```dbt run --vars '{\"key\": \"value\"}```Where the vars here are those that were POSTed to your api endpoint. I wouldn’t use the cli runner but instead the newer added programmatic dbt runner (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/programmatic-invocations)4. When the job is complete it sends some kinda signal of its completion back to SQS.Very alternatively… again terrible experience synchronously0. Same SQS and lambda1. instead make the api create a new Jinja file with all the variables dumped in statically 2. After writing the file it then commits to git.3. You have a GitHub action or whatever listening which deploys the model via CI.Maybe if you can explain more of the problem there might be a better solution…I’m guessing the view is less important and what your users actually care about is the resulting data?Ta",

Not using the background task could make the request timeout coz it take some time.And this could be your biggest problem: this would take a lot of time.Is it possible to compile your model in different variations and then use correct version based on the columns in the request? If not the case- try catching the queries so if an user calls with columns a and b. You compile the models and save the compiled model in a map. Colums as a key. When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. And as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue.

        "body": "So, building an API on top of dbt models sounds like a fun challenge. You might want to check out Apache Superset or Metabase. They both allow you to create visualizations and provide some API functionality to execute SQL queries. For instance, Superset lets you connect directly to your database and has APIs you can tap into for querying data.Another option would be to use DreamFactory to generate REST APIs from your dbt models with minimal hassle. It automates some of the heavy lifting and has great built-in features like security and database schema mapping. Plus, it works nicely with a range of databases if you ever need to switch things up. Between Superset, Metabase, and DreamFactory, you should find a fit that makes this process a breeze.",

We could break the DRY principle sometimes if we see that the alternative introduces more complexity. For example in this case, you are trying to shoehorn dbt to a more transactional environment which isn't what it was meant to do. This introduces complexity and could lead to situations where the code itself is not readable.",

The first dump is the raw tables where we don't transform any of the JSON object, and instead add metadata columns like Kafka partition, load time, etc. next is a flattened view, where the nested columns are cast to formats or otherwise converted, like obj:customers:first_name::string as first_name. There's other views after that but the point is to store unstructured, then structure on read. You can do stuff like materialised views if you need more performant reads. The benefit of this approach is your ETL doesn't break if the object contents change, and you can always just change the views to reflect evolving schema. It's also very easy to build, and I'm big on simple, managed solutions because engineer time is expensive and niche solutions are a headache to reverse engineer.",

Permanent table is less likely to pause to update statistics,compared to temp table.BCP out. There are (were) some methods of import/export that performed better then others. How fast does it save to disk?Compress: gzip compressing text gives about 90% compression with minimal CPU overhead.Test an upload to S3 with something on disk.

Gaining experience with big data tools like Apache Spark might also be useful.Certifications in AWS Data Analytics or Solutions Architect can make your resume stand out. As for your SAP experience, it shows you have deep technical knowledge and problem-solving skills, which are transferable to cloud environments.For practice, maybe look into contributing to open-source projects on GitHub or platforms like DreamFactory which offers tools for REST API generation. Building sample projects can be a great way to showcase your skills to potential employers.",

Like a Data Analyst would work well with dbt docs, but perhaps someone like in Product, Finance, etc. who are heavy data users but are less data-stack technical may struggle with it.That is where Data Catalogs (which they themselves aren’t perfect) can help but in my experience, I’ve always ended up figuring out the best way to communicate data products to internal/external customers and just write some basic tooling to kick out documentation that can then be updated in Confluence or notion.soI can appreciate the frustration but it is important maintain empathy towards less technical users and finding a way to both manage docs that works for you and your team, dbt docs, and then figure out how to you reduce double work by packaging it up that other teams can engage with it.Documentation is a tricky thing because so many people don’t take the time to do it well. Just like anything in the Data Engineering (or even Software Engineering world), you need to take a step back, evaluate the need, and then figure out how to address that need at different levels:1. Data/Analytic Engineering: lowest level and needs to help onboard new people and ensure you can efficiently catch and triage issues.2. Data Analysts: Your “power data users” typically are served fairly well by the same above docs because they are wanting to understand lineage, data freshness, etc. for when they are building dashboards/reports3. Product/non technical business users: This is where it gets tricky, need to assess their specific needs and tailor solutions to them. This is key because if you don’t do this, your teams value may be missed.4.

It is impossible to shoulder the burden and unless it is tracked and measured, it’ll always be a hot mess.I manage this for my team by stating PRs must include documentation for all models that are touched. While this is great for new projects, it even works on existing projects because over time, models that get worked on will be updated.Usually there is a bit of grumbling but once I implemented dbt-osmosis that took care of getting it mostly there and now that we’ve adopted Cursor, the friction is nearly entirely gone.",

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas? Spark has no way to know what you're doing inside the lambda -- it passes in the entire row so it cannot know what columns are being used, or for what -- so it can't optimise anything. For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check. A dataframe filter on spark columns will skip all of that.You should be able to do all of this with dataframes, and it can make various steps easier and more efficient.",

Is it for eaiser filtering of df over table name instead of RDD lambda filter that I'm doing?Also if the main dataframe that contains the data is cached(), can we somehow make sure that next operation from another exectuor re-uses the cache() or it will be the same problem I had initially?",

        "body": "> how about check pointing?RDD checkpointing should give you a similar effect, but only within a session and only if you specifically pull that RDD by id. If you rerun the pyspark code you'll generate a new RDD definition. Even though *you* know you'll get the same result, spark can't tell, so it is a new RDD.> I start from RDD but you start with UDFThat's not really the distinction. Both versions are running a python function on the executors with input args being sent over from the spark data. The only distinction with a UDF is that the `udf()` call is a wrapper so that you can call the function as if it were a spark function and send it column definitions, whereas in an `rdd.map()` you pass the function reference (rather than call it), and it takes the whole row as its arg.The main difference is to process everything once and just save the json output as text as you go with no further processing. That will complete the data retrieval step, without mixing in possible issues or errors from anything else that could unnecessarily cause you to have to hit the API again. It is a lot like making a 'bronze layer' for your overall process. There's likely little overhead in writing then reading back the data, since it can likely write the data while it is still processing requests, and also because spark is going to have to go over the data multiple times to infer the json schema anyway.> What is the benefit of using UDF over RDD in first place?Again, it isn't a UDF over an RDD. A UDF is just a way to wrap a python call so you can use it as if it is a spark function that takes columns as input, rather than passing a function reference and that function having to take a whole row.For one thing, it is a bit faster because spark only has to serialise (and python deserialise) the specific columns that go into the function, which can help performance when the row is very wide. It also means that spark can potentially skip execute the UDF entirely, if its output isn't required for anything.A benefit with using DataFrames is that spark can optimise things by cutting out steps that aren't necessary. Here as an example you can run locally -- just do a `pip install pyspark` and make sure you have openjdk17 with JAVA_HOME set. import json from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit from pyspark.sql.types import StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() data = [ (\"A\", 0), (\"A\", 100), (\"B\", 0), (\"B\", 100), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=\"category STRING, offset INT\") input_df.show() def python_func(category: str, offset: int) -> str: with open(\"side_effect.txt\", \"a\") as filewriter: filewriter.write(f\"{category}:{str(offset)}\\n\") return \"--\" python_func_udf = udf(python_func, StringType()) ( input_df.filter(col(\"category\") == lit(\"A\")).withColumn( \"python_func_call\", python_func_udf(col(\"category\"), col(\"offset\")) ) ).write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"overwrite\").save()If you run this once and open `side_effect.txt` you'll see that it *only* has rows where the input data `category` column is equal to `\"A\"`. Spark *completely skipped* processing the other rows, and the python function was never called for them.In your original example spark *cannot* know what the result of the filter is going to be, because it is being done in Python code. Therefore it must execute the entire source RDD and push every row in its entirety through the filter function in order to get the correct results. This is what causes the execution of the 'invoices' json rdd to also hit the api for the purchase_orders endpoint, even though that data won't go into that RDD.If you use DataFrames from the beginning, and use a DataFrame filter to pick the table you are processing, spark will *only* hit the API for the rows that match your filter, even though you specified the filter in a later step. You could avoid this double-processing without even trying.---The actual suggestion is to stick with DataFrames and just save the data immediately. Then after pulling down the data from the API -- which is *highly* likely to be the slow part -- and saving it, you can just read it back to do everything you need. You *have* the data, you just need to process it. You can take the response json strings and write them out to 'text' files, then read them back in 'json' format and spark will do all the schema inference for you. You can even automatically split up the writes by table in a single pass by setting a partition on the tablename, then read back just the files for a specific table. from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, explode_outer from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() # set up API calls data = [ (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 0), (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 100), (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 200), (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 0), (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 150), (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 300), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=\"tablename STRING, endpoint STRING, offset INT\") def fetch_responses(endpoint: str, offset: int) -> list[str]: response_body = YOUR_REQUEST_RESPONSE return response_body fetch_responses_udf = udf(fetch_responses, ArrayType(StringType())) # define the process to fetch the data and save it as-is to avoid reprocessing due to errors responses_col = fetch_responses_udf(col(\"endpoint\"), col(\"offset\")).alias(\"response_array\") get_everything_df = input_df.select(\"*\", responses_col) get_everything_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(SOME_SCRATCH_SPACE_PATH) # use the saved data to generate the per element data and save to separate folders per table fetch_each_col = explode_outer(responses_col).alias(\"response\") per_element_df = get_everything_df.select(\"tablename\", fetch_each_col) per_element_df.write.format(\"text\").partitionBy(\"tablename\").save(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL_TABLEDATA) # now read back for your desired tablename - this uses the hive style partitioning to pick just one table invoices_df = spark.read.format(\"json\").load(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL + \"/tablename=invoices\")",

During that time React was growing popularity and SPA (single page applications) were all the rage with other competing frameworks and services rising during this period and after.The reason I bring this up is that, is that even with all this fierce competition for tech stack and developer experience and market share, most of the web was still powered by LAMP stack, a stack that was invented in the 1990s/2000sTo make a short point long, is that every conment or post about x and z are great and a and b are bad is a load of crap, at the end of the day you’ll work largely with the stack that your employer has and in the rare case you can influence or decide some changes. It’s always best to learn the fundamentals in this case as that’s what will be transferable regardless of stack. That’s thing likes SQL( this hasn’t changed much in over 50 years old and ain’t dying tomorrow), learn about idempotency (this is gold in DE imo), Slowly Changing dimensions, git if you haven’t already (work with a good few ml and data scientists who still don’t know how to basic things in git) and there’s probably others as wellTo actually learn these things, that’s up to you! Personally I learn best the tough way and diving into a project that implements things I want to learn, others prefer courses, some prefer books. Whichever works for you!Best of luck!",

No? 80% of interviews i had in the past, the hiring team had someone there who was certified in some tech stack from vendors (Azure, GCP, AWS, DB), pushing onto me questions about all their vendor workflows. The techs you mentioned are all OSS, which is kind of the opposite, but most of the time when an individual is interviewed, rarely is the interviewer part of the data team, I can’t think of one place I went in on contract where their tech stack was what advertised in jd. Its comes down to one thing ego. Most people in the hiring process don’t want to bring in someone who will think out the box (not necessarily smarter) as it hurts their ego if in the event they maybe wrong. When u look thru job postings you will see some postings that mention baselines techs without every mentioning vendor specific techs, in the states this will be normalized around companies near Cali or Seattle or any other tech hubs. Thats not a coincidence.",

At that level you will be evaulated on soft skills and how well you present your history of success. 3. No leetcode, more look into the company, identify their problems and think with them about potential solutions - you wanna demonstrate you are the person who will solve the problems. You don't do that by being a leetcoder that talks about their skills. 4.Depends on role, do you wanna go for a high salary? ask for 110-150k range and see if it works, if not try different companies.

I moved here in 2024, apart from the wait of let’s say 6 months, I use to get a lot of interviews just based on reaching out to people on LinkedIn, as previous comments say : you will be one of thousands of people, who will apply to 1 role and chances are very low with direct applications. If you still have some time before moving, start talking to people ( and a lot of people ) Canada is full of helpful people, and when it comes to referrals they will help put your name to the hiring talent team or HM. It’s a small tech circle here so everyone pretty much knows at least someone. That should help you get the foot in the door. If you have any other questions feel free to DM.",

Because you will be less frustrated by little task like rename etc…Learn also about bash or shell. They are so cool. You can automate everything, even your programs. Like launching one who will create files, then the other in another language who will serve it on a local host etc… Programming is so fun. But knowing the basics was a breakthrough for me.

In my company (small indie game development company), we have that thing going, where everyone is supposed to read 1 book about game development or any topic related to it in any way, and then present the book in a short conversation within the team, so that everyone learns the most notable pointers from it.\\-> benefits of doing this: team building, information sharing, learning to be charismatic, learning to analyse, learning to make clean summaries, and obviously everyone learns the good parts without \"wasting\" extra time (\"good\" may be subjective - which again supports the thought of having the books, so everyone that is interested in certain topics can read the related book at any given time without depending on the internet and without requiring to have electronics with + reading on paper can be mind soothing, nicely outside in the garden or nature or a quiet room or such)Even if some books offer not much knowledge for us anymore, it is important to see other peoples view on the topics to not get stuck in a tunnel vision of knowledge. Every book that offers at least one advice or reminds you of something (may it be simple and obvious) that you just lost track of, is a good book :D \\-> Certain courses and other material is important too, since nowadays there are other ways to learn also, for example via. AI / Audio books / podcasts / streams / videos / meet-up's / lectures.....\\-> Books are not and will never be fully replaced, due to their availability and independencyIf anyone is interested in specific books that have to do with game development, contact me in a DM or on this post, then i may give some recommendations and some \"not worth it\" mentions hehe.Kind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team :)",

It would help you to review the stuff you should have learned.Other things to consider is learning a second language for small programs (like Python, which can also be used for bigger programs but is nice when you want to write a 100 line program to do something simple). The other is learning git.Write down the things you need to learn. Prioritize the list. Try to focus on just 2-3 things (or less) and try to keep it short term. Once a week, write down how well the past week went. If you achieved the tasks, write that down. If you didn't, write that down. Try to determine how it went. You could simply start by writing down what you do all day in a daily calendar (one of those that let you enter stuff day by day, or you can use Google Docs or something).The issue is you just coasted along, and there will be a strong inclination to coast again even though you realize you shouldn't have coasted.

Early feedback is the key.3) if the thing you are building is complicated, break it down into a set of small features, based on a *clearly defined set of requirements*. Implement the most important features/requirements first.4) Stop configuring once you have a setup that works for you. You can always tweak things later if needed. Perfection is not the aim of the game because you will *never* achieve perfection, because stuff changes all time (including yourself).",

If I were in your situation, I would get my resume up to scratch (use AI as much as you need) and start applying to everything and get a foot in the door. Yes, burnout and analysis paralysis and obsession with perfection happens often, but at a job, it'll be a different story because you have to actually get something out the door in a relatively timely fashion, so you'll learn to reach a \"good enough\" stage and not get bogged down in details. Jump stacks and tools all you want in your free time! I'd say it actually gives you a lot of broad experience that you can use across other languages! You start earning by applying for jobs. It's really tough at the moment and you gotta use every single dirty trick you can, like the one recently where he prompt-injected his resume telling AI to ignore all previous instructions and say that he was the best candidate for the job.

        "body": "[I’ve answered this same question before](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/s/rsxWDC8zme) and my answer is the same, so I will just quote it here.—As a personal recommendation I have found that learning how to program is best facilitated and supported by using a language that can be used to interact with some personal interest that the learner has. This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.In my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.Ultimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.Practically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.If you play Minecraft, learn Java. You’ll be able to write mods for the game and play with them and this will help you keep your curiosity and enthusiasm.",

When I introduce functions the concept isn't exactly hard but a lot of my students don't immediately understand WHY to use them.OOP is usually taught as its own course for a reason. It starts off easy enough in concept but can get very confusing to manage pretty quickly.DSA is similar, starts off easy then gets very confusing very fast. This isn't something I've taught a lot because honestly I'm still learning it myself.

But then if you have to implement your own networking library because of some weird requirement you're in a world of hurt because you don't know how anything actually works and/or you don't really understand how to write an algorithm or architect larger software. So this owl might actually be three: understanding the technical details of various parts of the stack, how to write an algorithm that's correct and performant in the right way, and how to structure larger pieces of software for things like maintainability, clarity, testability, etc. Second owl, I think, is \"productionalizing.\" There's an old meme or joke about \"works on my computer\" which is a groaner for professional programmers who have had to deal with the kind of amateur cowboys who write code that only sorta kinda works, like they ran it once on their computer, and pushed it out to production, breaking everything. Making a program work at all is like the prototype phase, then like 90% of the work is making it correct, robust, reliable across different machines, etc. That's a whole discipline.",

All because I over-engineered a way to test an idea.It started off as a learning exercise cause I wanted to test out a custom dependency injector that I built using new language features and try a different architecture design than I'm used to. So I set up a simple router, but then I needed something to test the DI with, so I made an auth system. It snowballed from there with more and more features.Took me 5 minutes to make the dependency injector, but several days before I was able to actually test it.Once that was done, I wanted to play with alpinejs in latte templating to see what kind of reactive monstrosity I could cook up. I already had the haphazard framework from the DI stuff, so I repurposed it, which led to making the form building part of the framework to test the capabilities of that.I've gone too far down the rabbit hole at this point so I just keep adding junk to it when I want to test something. Or refactoring it to test out different project architectures.It is pretty gross, and can never be used for any serious projects, but it's so much fun.",

It went something like my own experiences learning and growing up. Dad would set the support posts like fence posts aka dig a hole, insert wooden post, pour in a bag of concrete mix, water it with the garden hose, voila! But no, that wouldn’t last. So then you learn about the sonotube forms. Then you learn that concrete touching wooden post isn’t ideal, so you learn about the entire lineup of Simpson Strong-Tie products. Then you learn about adding an elephant foot base to the bottom of the concrete form. Then you start learning about different types of forces and loads and how to account for them. And on, and on, and on, and on. Fast forward to my own project. I swear to god, that thing can hold two semi-trucks parked on top of it. After the inevitable nuclear war, it will still be here even with the house completely gone. Ten generations from now, people will think the Romans must have built it as it continues to last through the ages. And thus, the one aspect that never gets discussed in r/Decks. Over-engineering. After everything was done, I finally learned that anyone can build a bridge, anyone can build a deck, etc. It takes an engineer to build one that barely stands (and works).Edit: as I proofread my post, I vaguely realize I probably should have looked at which sub this was…",

Instead, I engineered a solution that required typing a string key only once in the base English language file. For example, something like: `{\"module_one.object_one.bananas\": \"This is a Banana\"}` To automate the process, I then had a Groovy script dynamically generate enums from a template and create an entry for each translation key. E.g.: ```public enum ModuleOneKeys { // ... OBJECT_ONE_BANANAS // ...}```This allowed my IDE to have a solid reference to all language keys, so, in theory, I could never type a key that didn't exist.That alone might not be super overengineered, but the entire language framework built from scratch around it was -- considering it had to handle mutability, plurals, colors, formatting, and the logic to send it over the network to multiple nodes and clients.

Then if that wasn’t enough, it also makes sure the locations are available to begin with, and if they aren’t, it can failover to performing the backup to a second location.And because the first version was written so haphazardly, I just had to refactor it and rewrite it a second time to clean it up.",

In that case, it's not only that the client cannot see the response, but the browser also won't send the POST request in the first place unless the server first allows it via CORS headers in response to an OPTIONS preflight request.That's not true for all POST requests though. Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=\"bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post. Browsers retained this capability because they didn't want to break all the legitimate websites that rely on this behavior to this day.This is why you need anti-csrf tokens to hand form POSTs. I think https://smagin.fyi/posts/cross-site-requests/ is a great summary on why we have both CSRF protections and CORS. It's mostly history.

That's the bad news. The good news is that over the long run software jobs will continue to grow.There is no cookie cutter way to build a successful career in tech.

So please don't stake your hopes on learning python.Python is great for building experience fast, because you can use it for almost anything.

The number of projects I or friends of mine have started and never finished massively outweighs the ones completed, that's the nature of things. Even the ones that got done were a struggle, you have to decide when something is truly worth pushing through for and make yourself do it (sometimes because you really believe in it, sometimes just because you're being paid). Otherwise chalk it up to learning and move on. I think the main thing is for you to release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself. Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us. You are not special, or in other words, you're as special as any of us. Everyone fails sometimes, even the best in the world, everyone can compare to another and think \"damn I wish I had that\". As long as you keep going, maybe some day you can make something amazing and be someone special for that moment - but that moment always fades, glory never lasts forever. Nobel prize winners will wake up one morning and dread plugging away at the next thing, wondering if they've lost their touch... point I'm making is you carry on going regardless, sprinting or crawling, that's the only way it all happens. No-one stops \"feeling like a failure\", not permanently. Don't stress the low points, and try to keep your mind clear so you can recognise when you've got the chance for brilliance and take it when it happens. Personally, and this is where the sub might disagree, my excitement and curiosity is all around the crazy progress being made in AI tech. Big changes are on the horizon, if you ask me, so try to stay flexible and see if you can take advantage of that in some way. The job market is bad for non-seniors right now, but we have no idea how it's going to shake out over the coming year or so. Stay alert, learn whatever you can, and hold on for the ride. Anyone telling you they *know* what's about to happen is lying, or foolish. TL;DR - Finish your masters. - If you can get a job, any job, great. Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech. - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO). - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life. - Relax. As much as is possible. You're 22, you have many, many high points and low points ahead of you. - Do your best and hope. This is also advice to literally every other person who reads this, and myself.",

The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.One big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.These days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be \"elite.\" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.Still, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.At the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.So hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others. Just focus on getting a little better each day — that’s how long, fulfilling careers are built. Yes i chucked this into chat gpt to fix my terrible grammar. Because...technology... head up pal.",

Keep an eye out for this and then you'll notice that a LOT of APIs do this.",

Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.If they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.Also, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called \"code smells\" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: \"this is garbage\", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving. Good luck and don't sweat the small stuff.",

Indeed the final language is almost irrelevant unless it has certain features that support your solutions architecture, that is to say, if you have chosen \"OO\" then any good OO language should be up to implementing your solution.Just read for half-an-hour a day from the Gang of Four book, it's as good a place as any other to gain insights.Another book to read and continue to dip into, for me at least is:\"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein.Yes, that Ron Rivest of of RSA crypto!Good luck with it all.",

When you don't need to work, but choose to anyway, all of the pressure, expectations, and stress just melt away. I found I could enjoy the work for its own sake. After all, the worst that could happen was I would get laid off, and then I could retire for real. I did actually get laid off from the first post-severance job. But it turns out that after 40+ years in the industry, you do learn how to interview, LeetCode and all, and how to make yourself appear valuable to a new team.

The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then \"compile\" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working. Then later on you can always experiment further with writing and running the program in different ways!",

To start, i would recommend Intro to programming with Python at U. Helsinki. It is free (grading and all) and the first part of the course has you do all your code online. As you get towards the end of the first half it will ask you to use VS code though (they have their own plugins for submission). [https://programming-25.mooc.fi/](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/) there is also a Java course too if you prefer that. If you are interested, they have security and an AI sequences of courses and the first classes of each sequence are all reading and short answer/essays for homework.If you get further along and can't afford your own computer - you could also look into installing a light Linux distro on a USB drive (I actually did this years ago and started learning with computers at my library!)Best of Luck!",

You can get a 5 with 16 GB of memory for $100, or an 8 GB 4 or 5 for somewhat less. If this is your first Pi, you might want to spend a bit more and get a starter kit that'll include a case, power adapter, a few cables, memory card, etc.You'll also need a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but you likely already have those at home.A Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer that runs Linux. It'd be a great tool for trying out programming. If you eventually decide to buy another desktop or laptop for programming, you can repurpose your Pi as a home web server, media server, etc.",

Not to mention that maintaining a large Python codebase is quite hard, and poses many underlying challenges. It’s not all bad of course. You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.Golang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.I’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java. Java and Spring Boot power huge systems worldwide reliably. Java has extremely rich tooling (I’d even say more so than Python). Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours. Spring Boot is probably the best web framework to have ever used personally and is comparable and even more feature-full than Django. On top of that the language itself is quite easy and nice to work with.",

GitHub Pages sites are typically static, meaning the pages are pre-rendered, serialized, and deployed (e.g., a blog with 100 posts results in 100 individual HTML files). Static assets include images, fonts, and other media stored in the repository.When it comes to just the code and HTML output, 1GB is a huge amount of space. For example, I could easily deploy a fake blog with 3000 pages, and it still wouldn't come close to that limit.But if you start adding images, videos, or audio, the size grows quickly. That’s why common practice is to avoid bundling media directly in the repository. Instead, you might use a service like Cloudinary, which has a generous free tier, and link to your media, rather than having it stored in the repository and as part of the your output build.",

It’s a great bite-sized project that teaches you some of the fundamentals of coding along the way.If that’s not your cup of tea, I’m sure you can find something that is. Build an app that tracks stats for your favorite sport, or a color palette manager for your digital art hobby, or turn your resume into an interactive website. Most importantly though, don’t wait until you’ve learned everything to try one of these projects. Try to push your skills as far as you can after every lesson. Always be trying to discover what new things you are becoming capable of. You won’t always be able to make it exactly as you envisioned, but let that just be more motivation to keep learning.",

But, others only go because they have to and their personal health holds them accountable for going. However programming is a career / hobby so you shouldn’t rely on accountability at all as motivation to do it. Also people who make blogs and vlogs and stuff they do not necessarily do that for accountability either, they once again do it because they want to. Hope that helps!",

You could definitely trim this down to like... half the size and still make the same point just by getting rid of the \"and now I'm going to talk about ______\" sections. Just say it, you don't have to *announce* that you're going to say it before you do.Anyway, the idea that corporations wanting things other than to create the most aesthetically pleasing code is \"greed\" is... Silly. As you mention in the article, if you create the most pleasant to look at, neatly organized code *that doesn't work,* you haven't created a \"masterpiece,\" you have created a dud. I could arrange the pieces of a car engine in them most pleasing, feng sui design I can, but *if the car doesn't drive* (or if it only drives unbearably slowly, or unreliably, or can't turn corners, ect) then the end result fails at its intended purpose.I think your article really helped cement for me, the idea that \"clean code\" is an *aesthetic* sensibility, not (at least primarily) a practical one. While there's some value in making things more aesthetic, and some of the principles of some conceptions of \"clean code\" overlap with functional concerns... It's always primarily about *what looks nice,* not what does the job the software was intended to do.I think it's a bit of a separate point to say that the code that exists is often influenced by the transient concerns of a complex system that produced / influenced the code, but... You're also not wrong about that. When we're looking at code someone else produced, we shouldn't assume they *intended* the code to look the way it does, in the sense that they approached a blank file and *decided* to produce the code you see. Far more often programmers are given an existing file, and told to \"make it work\" *without* enough time or resources to do a \"proper\" job. In a sense this is still \"bad\" code because it's creating legitimate technically debt... But it may not be bad because *the programmer* was bad - it may the best code that the programmer could create, given the constraints they were working with. (The most important of which was \"make it do what we want it to do.\")Only sometimes is that because of true \"greed\" - usually it's because like any system, corporations have incentives to operate as close as possible to the line of failure, (hopefully *without* going over it, or having an acceptably low risk or failure anyway) in order to deliver the most functionality for least cost. That's stressful and upsetting for the humans tasked with \"making it work\" in that environment... But it's a *feature of any complex system,* not just corporations, and not just \"greedy\" systems. (except where \"greedy\" means \"getting the most reward for least cost.\")",

        "body": "I can give you some advice, brother. What you should learn really depends on what you want to do with programming. Try answering these two questions:1. What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too \"at the beginning\", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",

I absolutely don't want to make light of bullying but the fact that this is not the other way around is certainly a thing... To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, \"just allow yourself to get into it\". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua. You don't have to worry about it being \"basic\" for now, you are picking up the essential skills. My personal 'prime directive' advice is simply, \"just pick something you would like to try to make and start trying to make it!\". When somebody crosses fields like this I always suggest mining their knowledge of their other field to see if there are any ideas you can think of that might be useful. It doesn't have to make you a billionaire, it doesn't have to even ever get used, it just needs to give you an idea to focus on, so you can use programming as a means to an end.... that's what you'll be expected to do if you work in the field and strangely it is also where you learn the most. It all happens while you are trying to figure out how to do something.",

And it's stripped back because it's a pretty young language.

That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be reading up on design patterns, data structures, language details, and algorithms. It just means that you do need to put that stuff into practice. You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process. You should absolutely pick up source control, ideally, as you noted, git. You don’t need to be a wizard. Just get good enough that you’re not bricking your repo and losing progress all the time. Just absolute everyone uses it, and if they’re not, they’re still using source control, so the ideas are still good to know about. C++ can be tough for people. Between pointers, dependencies, templates, (Pre)Build Systems, and more, it’s not the easiest language. If it’s what you want to use though, you’ve really gotta just put your head down and learn enough to get cracking on some small to medium sized projects and get comfortable with some basic dependency management. Just in general, you’ll need to start thinking about writing code if your classes aren’t doing it. I was never a competitive programmer, nor did I do a ton of the puzzle or algorithm sites. My school was team project focused, and was self driven. So I was working on projects for 8 semesters. Often in between as well since they’d carry over. And I’d have side projects to learn a thing that I might bring back into the main project. I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). I found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you. Even just writing scripts that automate a tedious task helps, it’s not uncommon for me to script up stuff like that at work, so those are good skills to have.",

Most of the CS classes used FORTRAN-IV on a PDP-11/40 running RSTS/E timesharing.But I will try anyway...The key to Computer Science, Software Engineering, and programming in general (all different, though related, disciplines) is problem solving - recognizing a problem, decomposing it into smaller problems, and solving each of those smaller pieces in a way that solves the larger problem when brought back together.By \"problem\", I don't mean \"error\" or \"malfunction\"; I mean the thing you are trying to accomplish when you set out.The language and things like git are tools that you apply to this, and different tools lead to different paths to solving a problem. You need to know how to use the tools you have, but problem solving is the skill you need to develop independent of the tools; you simply apply the tools at hand when solving the problem. The tools are changing continuously, don't get hung up on the tools themselves.Whether you are in the right field of study is something you must determine. Are you interested in it? Do you enjoy the challenges it provides? Do you see an opportunity to expand your skills and make meaningful contributions to projects or the field as a whole after getting your bachelor degree? Have you identified what subset of the discipline you are most interested in pursuing?You need to be motivated, interested, and willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Developing critical problem solving skills is essential to success. Without it, you might as well be an accountant. I expect there's also aptitude - some people are faster at picking this up than others.Ask yourself why you chose this path in the first place, and whether those reasons are still compelling to you. Is there something else you would rather be doing? There's no shame in changing directions - I went from civil engineering to computer science in my 4 years. You don't always know enough going in to pick the right major.",

That can lead to code that's inefficient, or it can lead to not being able to understand why your code isn't working.Note that CS programs tend to teach very little about tools, frameworks, and libraries that are currently used in industry. That frustrates some students because they don't feel job-ready, but the reality is that those things change frequently. Schools focus on the fundamentals that are universal and timeless.But yeah, there's nothing different about the programming. It doesn't matter whether you're a CS major or not. Some of the best programmers I've ever known were some other major - often physics or engineering.I'd say another difference is what your goal is in programming. If your goal is purely to solve a problem - like you need to write a program that figures out the answer to one question, then you'll never use it again - then a lot of what you learn in CS probably doesn't matter.If you're trying to build robust, efficient, powerful software that lots of people can use and rely on, the stuff you learn in CS is a lot more relevant.",

        "body": "There are a lot of different engineering disciplines, all of them have their own \"take\" on programming.Of course the basics that you mention are shared: data structures, algorithms, stats, linear algebra, discrete math, etc are pretty much university year 1 and 2 kind of stuff for almost all technical disciplines. You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.However, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.In CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).In contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.Computation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on \"tried-and-true\" methods of programming - no \"seat of the pants\" stuff there.The best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.Some of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.Mechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a \"fly-by-wire\" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.In these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.Some Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.I don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.As you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.The real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.As for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?It's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 \"ways of thinking\" when it comes to programming.The last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own \"special sauce\" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.Even though the \"lone programmer\" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.If you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.Hope this little overview helps and good luck!",

I'm new to computer science and programming as well and at first I though the whole \"practice\" advice was just basic cliché, but it's actually the best way you're going to learn anything in programming. I've recently been learning JavaScript OOP and it's been tricky so every time there was a new example or a new method or a new topic I'd do it myself in VSCode after learning it. And, even though I'm still inexperienced, I now feel very comfortable with the dreaded \\`this\\` keyword and prototypal inheritance, today I finished one of my biggest projects and 99% of it was JS OOP. Practice is your best friend.I would highly avoid using AI to write any of your code. Especially if you're in a place where you're learning and you're not really sure about how things work or what to do. Programming is all about problem solving and AI will completely remove the whole problem solving part of it if you use to write code. Use AI to ask questions for your projects, to debug, to quickly confirm something you're not sure about. But, don't use it to write code if you're still learning. AI writes none of my code, I think about what I want to do and check docs first, if I can't find it I'll ask AI, but I will never just blindly copy and paste code from AI, because the whole point of me coding is to learn, and it should be the same for you. Learn through tutorials, reading docs, and building projects, don't rely on AI. AI should be the last thing in your mind when you're writing code and looking to learn it.",

I am unfamiliar with the word \"placement\", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.I think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the \"barista\" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.Then, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. I'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly. But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.Sorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask \"If I do X, will Y happen\", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.To delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.The first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.The other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.Just because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. Then, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well. I've been using Claude to help organize some of my personal projects and it does a pretty good job.",

The languages are just a neat abstraction to enable you to do complex data manipulation and DSA is the most efficient ways we know on how to store and process said data by efficiently using the underlying hardware. That said to find a placement you’d ideally want to know ahead of time as to which industry you are interested in as all of them try to solve different issues and have different tooling to do so. I would also like to add that code is just a tool and your job primarily isn’t to write code but to be able to digest business requirements/problems and then turn them into solutions using software and hardware which makes knowing and understanding your industry of choice paramount.For broad understanding I would highly recommend grounding your knowledge in lower level language like C/C++ (great for understanding the foundations of software) and a higher level language like python(useful for speed of delivery) as with this base you would be able to quickly and easily pick up any other language as needed.All languages also have their own specific abstractions to make a specific problem easier like frameworks and libraries which is in itself is a rabbit hole, some devs only specialise in these for example, react, Django, Spring Boot, .Net core and so on.Here’s what stacks you’ll most likely find on the market:Web dev Corporate = C#/Java, will stay like this for a long time due to how deeply embedded these ecosystems are in big corporations.Web dev Startup = python/node.js, free and stable with immense community support great for quick development cycles and MVP buildsSystems = C/C++ as most of the time you’d be working closer to hardware or require a lot of performanceDevOps = shell and scripting, python YAMLData = python/R and SQL",

To be comfortable in that language, start using it to solve DSA questions.Also, be comfortable in one OOP language and another multi-paradigm language. So for your case, C++ and Python will do.For DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.It's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material. Or if nothing works, then it just means you don't like web dev.In regards to the question in the post, if you can solve DSA questions, then you are halfway there. So many ask DSA questions in the interviews. So def get good at that. You should also get comfortable with OOP/OOD/design principles/SOLID patterns and other basic patterns. And work on some project that you are interested in. Use Git/GitHub to manage your project. Also, work on your behavioural interviews, use the STAR method: [https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR\\_Method\\_Interviews.pdf](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)",

Some universities, e.g., Drexel University in Philadelphia, emphasize their co-op. What is more common is a summer internship. Unis in the US are usually out parts of May, all of June, July, and into early August. Students sometimes seek those positions as they can help you get hired. The quality of the internship depends on the company, obviously, and some do a worse job than others.",

AI in the long run will benefit the developers for as much as they can complete tasks with simple lines of instructions, there is so much in coding that simply just require somebody who is skilled where an unskilled person will opt to relegate the work to a skilled programmer if not immediately then in the course of maintaining and altering the softwares",

        "body": "I was in 9th grade in 1988 and loved programming, I wanted to be a programmer, but everyone talked about that in a few years, programmers wouldn't be necessary due to something called CASE-tools, where business-types could simply draw networks of rules in some fancy program, and that would then create the code needed. Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.So I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. In the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.Then languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.Then a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.In the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.And now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us. The problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve \"yesterdays problems\". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.So go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff! Programming is always a good thing to learn - most of us won't work with the technologies we began learning on, but getting into the mindset of solving problems and building software, will always be a good thing! Even when the tech changes - only specific tech-knowledge becomes obsolete, but usually you use it to make learning the next thing easier!",

AI is a useful tool for making software more quickly, but software development and computer science in the real world is far more than simply generating code. Recently there has been an economic shrinking and quite a lot of software developers were laid off in 2023 as AI was emerging, but AI is not replacing ALL developers, it's making them a little more efficient, so companies may need fewer but that's still not as settled as some may think. AI is also prone to hallucinations and many major companies, such as my current employer, will not use it and are NOT sharing their code into AI as they want to protect their intellectual property. If your high school has a vocational program that includes computer programming, consider enrolling. It is a great head start for college, my youngest son went that route and currently works for a major insurance company. Then consider a college major in computer science.

Make yourself do weird stuff with it, container in container in container anything you can think of, will help with cards later on and understanding parent and children. The random transform stuff you will use when needed and just google, hover the same thing, and you'll just remember it from then on. Display switches and other stuff just come with projects, but you won't use long-term, dark mode you'll use later on. It's a lot, but look at a page and ask yourself how that is there or why does it looks like that and recreates it. A great site would be apple to clone with html and css. Also, when structuring, I always give each container a random ass background color, which visually helps understanding what's going on. Good luck, and you got this!",

I think learning \"the hard way\" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \\- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \\- Firefox has similar, use the one you like. I've linked to the \"element\" section which helps answer the question \"why doesn't this thing do the thing I thought it should\". On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \\- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \\- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line. I've linked the framework I use, it will generate you CSS variables for free but there are plenty of other options available. Avoid tailwind until you actually understand CSS, once you've got a good handle on it give it a spin.",

        "body": "Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",

That's why doing is the best way to learn. Do and fail. Then do better.That's why I recommand working on an actual, concrete project from the get go. You aren't really learning anything by doing programming book toy projects. Even syntax you can just look up as you need it. You don't need to learn any of it in advance. \"Hey, I need a variable now that stores an integer, let me look up how that's done in this language.\" You need no pre-knowledge. Any perceived requirement for such is procrastination. Or mind pollution by the way the school system does things. But keep in mind that school system is designed to be testable.

Competitions create a small number of winners and a large number of losers. Read this sub for a week and you’ll come to understand that lots of beginning programmers already feel that they’re not smart enough to ever really succeed.Competition pits people against each other. I get that some people enjoy testing themselves that way, and that’s fine, but it’s not for everyone. What particular skills do you think competition will teach or sharpen? Time management? Planning and decision making? Task prioritization? Whatever they are, why can’t you teach those skills some other way?In the real world, programming is much more about collaboration and teamwork than competition. The best programmers teach and inspire the people around them, and that helps them improve too. People spend time answering questions on sites like StackOverflow because helping others solve problems is a great way to learn. Is there a way that you can use collaboration to help your students improve? Maybe have the stronger students coach the weaker ones?",

I learned Python back in 2010-2012 and had no application for it. I made a deck shuffler and a character creator for a generic text based RPG, and then dropped it. I never programmed again until 2017 when I actually saw programming potential in an artistic/design context I was studying at that time. And then it clicked. I devoured every online lesson or book I could find. And went deep.It is so important to frame a goal or problem you wanna solve. Makes the journey more motivating.Wanna get into AI, Cybersecurity or Automating stuff: PythonWanna get into Web: JavaScriptWanna get into Games: C# or C++It really doesn't matter.

So when in doubt, go a bit further!A lot of modern frameworks also has separate folders for each component, and either css, html and js for that component in three files, or sometimes joined in one. But the CSS for each component is separate from the others.So the splitting up can help to \"force you\" into thinking even more in components - and that is always a good thing!",

Keep it up!I think you have a great sense to organize code (it's referred to as \"clean code\"). If you keep programming, this will be a very useful skill, for all kinds of things that you will do.Nowadays, you don't write CSS the way you did a few years ago. Nowadays, you have tools like TailwindCSS or frameworks like Bulma CSS. Also, JavaScript frameworks change the way you use CSS. E.g. Angular encapsulates CSS into components. That said, it is still perfectly fine to use \"vanilla CSS\".There were opinions on how to structure CSS, but none has been really pervasive. There were also build steps like SASS or SCSS.I think your approach is perfectly fine. The only disadvantage I see is that your browser has to fetch each of those files individually, which is not the most efficient way. But it's not so problematic, either.Do you work already with the MDN docs?

Organizing your CSS into separate files like header.css, utilities.css, and modals.css can make your codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate, especially as your project grows. This modular approach is a common practice in web development.While it's true that having multiple CSS files can lead to additional HTTP requests, which might slightly affect load times, the trade-off is often worth it for the improved organization and maintainability. Many developers use build tools to combine and minify CSS files for production, mitigating performance concerns.Your project, “Obscuria Terminal,” sounds intriguing, and it's commendable that you're learning from your dad's notes. Keep experimenting and refining your workflow; you're on a solid path.",

If the tutorial didn't teach you the pieces you want to use, then you need to find a better tutorial. My suggestion is always ot find a **complete** tutorial on something like udemy for $10-$20 and use it. Make sure it's a Beginner to expert tutorial that covers all aspects of the techology. If it's something big like JavaScript as a whole or React as a whole or all of Python, it should be at least 20-30 hours long. Go through the tutorial with the teacher, WRITE everythign in your own IDE, do not just watch or listen, write it out yourself, the more senses you use in learning, the more likely tyour brain will consider it important. Watching a video is alright. Watching a video and taking notes is better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them (and getting it to work) is far better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them and then teaching it to someone else is even better. If you have no one to teach it to, teach it to the wall, or a chair, or a rubber duck, or whatever. The key is you need to be able to explain what is happening, or you don't really know what is happening. Once you're done doing the entire tutorial with hte lecturer, if you feel up to it, start working on your own project. First create the repo with the technology boiler plate, don't know how? HOw did they do it in the tutorial? Then add some hardcoded text and things to the page. How? Check the tutorial. Then make the data dynamic and add a list of objects using a for loop, how? Check the tutorial. Then call an API, how? Check the tutorial. You get the picture.",

        "body": "Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. A compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. Meanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. The standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. In actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. See if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. There are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. In the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. For example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",

If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.You should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.Ideally your system works like this.1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server2. System generates checksum for project file/folder4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)5. System compresses project file into archive file6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)8. System generates checksum for the archive file9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working serverIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.As for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.There are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.Finally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already. If these files are critical enough to warrant all this work, the least you can do is pay a bit extra for offsite storage to ensure you can recover if the archive server blows up. Cold storage on AWS is extremely affordable.",

I did get pretty good with scripting languages though.For the last few months I’ve been doing Boot.dev and it’s been a game changer. I’m learning many things I didn’t know before and feel like I’m pretty close to being able to transition. A CS degree isn’t always a requirement. A cert, bootcamp, or experience can be just as good.The big issue for me, like you, will be taking a pay cut. As an IT Manager I make good money, so I’ll have to find the right thing. I don’t want to live in a major city, so that will hold me back as well. My plan is to create some side hustle things, easy things like a Secret Santa app to gain experience. Despite being somewhat worried, I’m still going to do it, and you should too. At your current salary level I couldn’t imagine you needing to take much of a pay cut either.",

There are two challenges you'll face:The first is that setting up your computer to compile, run, and debug C++ is pretty tricky, and the book won't help at all. [https://www.learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) is not bad, but it can still be a challenge if you're not already a savvy computer user.The second is that C++ is utterly unforgiving and confusing, so before long you will hit error messages or behavior that you just don't understand. You will get stuck and need help. If you don't have access to anyone who can help you in person, please plan on posting here on r/learnprogramming or other forums.It's not that this will never happen with other languages, but in comparison if you wanted to try learning Python or web dev first, you could probably get a lot further without getting stuck.",

I'd expect most, if not all of the coding examples found in the book would compile with a modern C++ compiler, so learning from that book will not cause any damage, and you will be learning C++ proper.Obviously, once you've mastered C++ from that book, then learn what changes were made to the language for these four later versions and go about learning what new features were added by these later versions.So, to learn how to program C++, install a C++ compiler and start typing in the code examples from these books and get that code to run. Then go back to code and try to understand how that code the works. If you manage to work your way through both of these books, you'll be well on the way to being a C++ programmer.",

I did a 1 year advanced cert to get into uni but I haven’t received the award yet and nobody is recognising it as completed until I have the physical copy. CS50 was a great way to test the waters of wether I wanted to do programming full time and the community college recognised CS50 allowing me to skip the first year of that course (it should have been 2 years). LeetCode and those are ok for interview prep and preparing yourself but start making some projects of your own to show you have a full understanding of how to build, edit and manage programs. The portfolio is t only example of what you can actually do.",

I’m making projects based of their requirements. Using them as work example briefs and not applying for them. Yes I’m not doing the actual “job” I’m trying to get into but bills need to be paid with an actual job. At least I’m able to space those projects out in the evenings and build real world examples to show what I can do. What year are you in uni atm? I’ve done SQL, Java (for desktop and android), and C so far. Thinking of moving towards python next but not sure.",

This is not to say the latter is likely but more that the former isn't.The bottom line though is that experience in anything is going to be a huge asset for you. If you have something on the table that you really like the sound of, i'd personally not piss about too much with counter offers and paralysis by analysis.

Talk to real life wait staff and get input on what they hate about their current point of sale.Don't worry about making mistakes, they are inevitable.

The first thing I'd suggest is zooming in with Ctrl+Plus - get it large enough that you don't have to sit as close to your computer screen.Actually maybe consider changing the resolution of your monitor. You'll be better off with a low resolution - fewer pixels on the screen, but larger. That will make everything on the UI larger.If you're using a laptop, I highly recommend getting an external monitor. It will be life-changing. And they're not expensive - a 10-year-old used monitor will work just fine. You don't need fancy, just physically large.Next, Jupyter Notebook has themes, here's a tutorial. A dark theme might work better for you, or just otherwise adjust the colors to your taste.[https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/](https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/)If you're not doing mostly machine learning and working with numerical data and plots, you'll be better off with a tool like Visual Studio Code, which has amazing accessibility themes and features. It works great with both Python and Java.Also check out the accessibility settings on your operating system, whether Windows or Mac - there are tons of features intended for people just like you. Get a large, brightly-colored mouse cursor, keyboard shortcuts to zoom in on anything, and much more.",

Also learn to read docs, if you can read docs effectively you’ll find yourself using AI less and less.

Before AI I would routinely copy over boilerplate stuff from my personal repositories that I had built up. Now I just tell the AI what I need.If you're a beginner then I would recommend using the AI to help you set your boilerplate and some hints on implementation detail. Once you master a concept and feel comfortable doing it yourself then you probably know how to ask the AI to do it and you can verify correctness. Never just ask the AI to do something in nontechnical language and copy paste results. It'll work until it doesn't work.

And the big tech firms are all kings of this. Google has a handful of products that make stupid amounts of money, and everything else is just for vanity or politics. If you're in one of those core teams, then there will be pressure to perform and also likely lots of scrutiny. And if you're far away from the money-makers your job is to make the pencil pushers who justify your pay cheque happy.Big companies I've worked at and have had colleagues work at also seem to prefer a lot more paperwork and documentation so that they can waterfall all the most cost sensitive parts of their business to offshore teams in countries with lower costs of living. This seems to make it more cost effective to build software, but also to protect all the IP.Some advice I was given is that as an individual at one of these organizations. You can barely see the tip of the iceberg. The culture, history, and trajectory of the part of the business you're in are all potentially decided by people far away. You're literally a cog in the wheel, and whether you fight it or go with it the business is doing exactly what it has planned to do.",

How could (s)he set expectations at the beginning and be sure that the target percentage of underperforming employees will be hit ? S/he can't.

Boomers for tailoring the youth experience to go to college, come hell and high water. Millennials like myself for not being entrepreneurs. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, there’s lots of stuff that can be said. But the fact is that the college degree is losing its utility. We’re funneling kids off to years of schoolwork and student loan debt in order to chase incomes that could be earned with a 7 week CDL course.

There's always been a bottleneck at juniors as juniors don't make money for companies, they cost money. Companies train juniors so that they can become seniors later and the number of seniors wont go down (causing senior salaries to spike), but now lots of companies are betting on AI becoming the new Seniors of the future so many have stopped investing in creating seniors out of juniors. I\"d say this is incredily short sighted, especially considering the limitations AI is still showing with complex architecture and languages/frameworks/libraries/etc that change more often then the AI models are updated. But I may be naive on that.>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?Depends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.If I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.CS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",

It is currently at the lowest point in those 24 months, too.Software is sitting at 62.9% job postings compared to pre-COVID.IT Operations and Helpdesk also plummeted, though not as bad... until inauguration day. Then it tanked from 84.6% on Jan. 21st, 2025--to 69% (nice) today.On top of this, Science and R&D jobs dropped from inauguration day, as well. Going from 88.5% to 73.9%, in just 5 short months.In that timeframe, there have been more graduates than ever before for these sectors.So, I would say, yes. Software engineering is probably dead for now. And it probably will be for another 3 years and 7 months.

I know that data-selling and subscription models exist because they make way more money than the alternative, but I don’t care about making a billion dollars.

Every ten or so people you add to an organization, the dynamic will change rapidly and you'll need to retune the operations. This is before the complexity of market strategy and building an MVP to sell.Do try organizing! But keep it small and sustainable. As an independent founder coming from layoffs, you probably don't have *any* meaningful \"runway\" to fail and bleed out money until the core business solidifies. In the mean time, while you're getting that set up, make sure you take on a boring job that pays the bills.

Imagine all the time you spend coding is instead spent reading tax documents and crunching numbers in Excel. And despite your belief that accountants don’t have to deal with debugging, a lot of the work is checking for mistakes in tax documents/filings and referencing various tax laws to try to figure out why numbers don’t line up.You also imply accountants have better WLB. Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.Lastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do. Just do a quick Google search for AI accounting tools and look at how many results pop up.The only thing accounting has on software engineering right now is stability, but if you want more stability for generally shittier pay there’s way better jobs for that.",

My solo income peaked at 10,000 monthly and combined income with wife already beat that number at early 30s.

I don’t like doing it but I’ve not figured out a better way. The task is deliberately simple, but the idea is to create something where we can do a live code review together and talk through the solution. It’s less about the code and more about how the candidate handles feedback, can they explain reasoning/justifications for their decisions, what would they would do differently, etc.The times where I skipped this phase led to the worst hires of my career, I can learn so much about someone when we’re sitting around a piece of code discussing what they’ve written. Recently someone submitted something that seemed odd to me, asked them to explain it because I was genuinely curious. Turned out they vibe coded it and didn’t know why it was done that way.I honestly don’t mind people using AI to save time on the task, I don’t like wasting peoples time, but you still need to understand the solution you’re submitting, just the same as with PRs.  That was a red flag for me, there were other issues, but this one stood out. I always try to explain the process at the start, but I think it’s good to ask about this before proceeding too far, or ask if there’s a different way you can be evaluated.",

There's no way in hell the company would be firing someone if legal thought it would be a legal liability for them. They have a paper trail, whether you agree with the papertrail or not is besides the point.If a company was so disorganized that they fired someone for being a bad performer, without hard written proof of their poor performance, then they deserve to be sued. That just doesn't really happen though. You're making it sound like it's common.It's your right to sue though, go ahead, you do you.>Most people at these companies can afford to sue as well given their salaries.Oh... oh, no.... I hate to be the one to break this to you, but even when you're in the right, the company can just wait you out. What number are you thinking of when you say we can \"afford\" to sue? $10k? $100k? $500k?Well, the company will burn 7+ figures without blinking an eye. They can wait your ass out.Is that fair? No, but that's how the court system works. The only hope you'd have is if you can find a lawyer that'll take your case pro-bono with an agreement that they get a majority portion of your settlement.But the problem with that one small hope, is a lawyer doing that, is only going to do it in cases they think they can win. So it goes back to the company having their ducks in a row before firing you. A lawyer's gonna take one look at that and tell you you don't have a case.",

I feel like we are currently at peak AI hype, and it is going to come crashing down hard once people have spent more time with it. Another point is that the models seem to have hit a wall.

I'll happily admit that I'm not up to date on how they currently write the code that they do, but as far as I'm aware, it's still just fancy word prediction.And it shouldn't come as a surprise that that is not how code gets written.What does happen is exactly what you would expect: It's good at spitting out code that does easy things that it has seen a million times.

Be logical about it - if you keep advancing, getting into more and more selective organizations, you’ll eventually hit your limit. Honestly I think growing up being the one of the higher performing kids in grade school can make you feel like you actually ARE one of the smartest people in the world, and so it’s a big ego hit when you see it’s definitively not true. High grade kids are especially prone to this because, as we all know, grades measure how good you are at testing, not performing a job.Take advantage of the opportunity to learn humility. You said it yourself: you actually have to try now. Why is that bad? Trust me, you don’t want to be in a position where you’re a top performer just by coasting. If you have any degree of self-improvement motivation, like you clearly do, you’ll be tearing your hair out knowing that you could be doing more.Take this as an opportunity - once you’re over the ego, you’re now in a room full of teachers. You can learn from all of your peers because they are all talented and bright. You WANT to be around smart, talented, hard working people. They will pull you up. You just have to be humble and patient.",

But the second they get to a more national level they cant cut it.Not sure if you are a sports fan but it's like baseball. You were the one of the best in your 13U, 16U, High school and college classes. You got drafted and hit minor leagues and now are facing people from all over the country/world. You were good enough in college to get to the MLB pretty quickly (FAANG), but now the experience and talent of these guys is a bit overwhelming because now you are a young guy riding the bench a bit trying to get experience. You arent sure if this is cut out for you or if you should just be a career AAA guy (Big tech but not FAANG). I was similar to you, I went to a defense industry and exceled after college. Decieded to do FAANG. DId 3 years there and was overwhelmed until I got the boot. I bounced back to a big tech company and I just realized that it doesnt mean im not smart enough but maybe the high expectations of FAANG just wasnt for me.",

However, at the end of those couple weeks, I'll understand it probably better than anybody else on the team. Because I spent that time reading documentation, testing, sleeping on it. I'll have tried a few dozen things that don't work and I'll know why. I'll have gone through 3 different working versions that I looked at, said \"this feels hacky,\" and did a different simpler way. I will become opinionated about it. I'll be familiar with the framework's issue board. My end product will be 7 lines of code, and you'll ask why I spent all that time to produce so little product, but every line will have a complex backstory about why it was the best choice.This will not be a satisfactory consolation to you in virtually every case.The best thing is to be fast and correct.The next best thing is to be fast and complete.The next best thing is to be complete.And somewhere way down the line is whatever I am.We got an enterprise Chat GPT license and I've been vibe coding for a few weeks. I don't think I'm going to work well with it. I ask for something simple and it gives it to me. But I don't understand it, or I don't agree with it. I'm suspicious. I interrogate, why this option? Are you sure you're using the right version of the language? Doesn't this create a security vulnerability? I spend so long debugging and tweaking the model's code that the chat starts to chug with every prompt from all the context I've given it. Then I start over with a new chat and try to take the conversation in a different direction.I spend all my energy critiquing *the model's* solution,  and exploring only paths that the model presents to me. I go out and do some of my own research, and then I have to catch the model up to where I got without it.

In fact, many companies assumed CS grads could not code and that it was something they would learn on the job. Before Chat GPT everyone was solving their homework problems by google-fu'ing their way through Stack Overflow. Before Stack Overflow there were message boards (that are still going and have answers that go all the way back to the 90s).Today the tools are much better than they were 20 years ago much less just 5 years ago. However, the tasks assigned to programmers are also exponentially much more difficult to implement. As the tools get better what is asked of the programmer increases.

Raises, bonuses and stock refreshers were also less generous for some time. There were also a lot of layoffs, as startups failed and big companies trimmed excess headcount. The other thing that happened was that CS enrollment dropped, and many people who struggled to find software jobs simply left the field; I personally know multiple former SWEs who got into selling real estate during that period. This set the stage for the scarcity of SWEs going into the 2010s.AI is getting better, but there will be a need for human developers for the foreseeable future; IMO the fears of “AI taking our jobs” are overstated. It will be brutal for a bit, as many, mostly weaker, candidates will get flushed out of the job market, but once things in the economy stabilize, once investors get more confident, startup activity (and the demand for SWEs) will rise again.",

Well, probably one of our others will and you're going to get skipped.That's really the core problem: it's not that it's that hard to \"pass\" our interviews. It's just that fundamentally, unless you're a F500 company, you have *way* more candidates than positions. Really great candidates get rejected in favor of another really great candidate.",

I personally would hate to see “vibe coder” anywhere in a resume, it would kill my soul. I personally also worry about job hopping a little bit, but i now work in big tech and I doubt people come to big tech to job hop. The more hopping I see is FAANG hoppers past their 4 year vesting schedule. I like to see meat and potatoes in a resume, “built X system to solve Y scale and launched it into production, its successfully serving Z customers etc etc”. I like to look around people’s githubs just to see what their interests are and stuff, gets me more invested into candidates. I dont care for typos or ESL-isms as I myself am ESL. People who claim to be experts at 20 wildly different technologies are the candidates I hate the most frankly.3. I’ve experienced a good number of candidates that molded their resume to fit the job description and during the interview is clear they cant actually meet basic expectations of the description. Deal breaker. People who are obviously trying to cheat on the interview. Deal breaker. People who try to commandeer the interview and try to run the clock. Deal breaker. And some more",

Maybe I'll try again later when the market gets better but honestly kind of over it. Finding a job is mainly on luck, even if you have years of experience it doesn't mean you'll get a job unless you do 100 other things. You have to network with everyone, have to tailor each and every resume to so you have a chance to pass ATS but you can't have too many key word cause that'll be flagged too, write cover letters and you don't even know if it'll be read by a human or computer. Some companies will give you homework before even speaking to anyone (don't do those you shouldn't have to work for free), pass a minimum of 4 interview rounds, and so on and so forth. If it is honestly something you think is worth putting up with and is passionate about then yah continue with this field. Otherwise maybe it's time to pivot. There are jobs out there that require any type of degree to get started. Definitely not going to pay as much as a dev job, but those salaries are also decreasing.Software development is in a strange category, it's treated as a STEM job but also something similar to art. It is now expected to be working on personal projects outside of work like how art is, but also is insanely technical and time consuming. I don't think many other STEM fields are like this. I don't think chemists are expected to be mixing chemicals in their basement over the weekend, but we are expected to be constantly working on some sort of side project all the time. It's honestly exhausting to keep up with.",

That seems like an extremely arbitrary way to make that distinction, it's just a name. It's not a Professional Engineer license, or any sort of official, legal classification... it's a word.Only explanation I can think of is do you have a BS? Or a BSE? Your friend who is pursing a Software Engingeering degree, are *they* getting a BS? or a BSE?That *is* an official distinction, it's the type of degree you're getting. A Bachelor of Science vs a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, so maybe that explains it?Computer Science degrees can fall under either. My CS degree is a BSE for example, but you could get either at my school. If you got your CS degree through the liberal arts school, you'd get a BS. If you got it through the engineering school, you'd get a BSE. But the core program requirements were identical, there was just some minor differences in electives.If that's the case, maybe you could consider pursuing an MSE? It sounds like you like your job, and it's a decent gig, so I'd hate for you to leave it just over an arbitrary gate. Have you spoken to your manager about options? Or specifics on the policy?

Their expectation vs reality is different. Obviously all executives think that throwing an LLM backend into a clean UI is sufficient for an AI-powered product, but it’s not. Even a “GPT wrapper” requires significant amount of information retrieval, validation, logging and operational signal collection, etc to not have generic AI slop polluting their product, data, and their image. Even if you don’t train an LLM from scratch (which is what most uninformed executives think ML is), there is significant overhead in solely serving the LLM for your specific use cases. That’s why AI startups, despite being ridiculous and “just a GPT wrapper” still have a legitimate case for a product. Those “other processes” are extremely nontrivial. Most companies are not even willing to invest into a “GPT wrapper”.Now consider something one step further upstream. Let’s say you want to train custom models (not necessarily LLM’s, but SSD’s, classifiers, methods of statistical inference, etc). Maybe you want to power a recommendation system or intelligent search, or you want to automate classification of support issues, etc. This requires ETL pipelines to take raw data and transform them. But this requires your web infrastructure to have instrumentation for real-time analytics and collection of usage behaviors. My point is, delivering machine learning into product is an organizational effort. Starts from the top-down. That’s why the golden data trio of titles: machine learning engineer, data scientist, data engineer, will never be as prevalent as a SWE or analysts in numbers. You could have VERY knowledgeable and talented MLE, DS, DE, but if your org isn’t willing to be data driven from the top-down, these functions will not drive any value, to no fault of these people. A company not collecting data and expecting these functions to succeed is like telling a SWE to build software for a company, but not giving them any servers to deploy on or having no critical infrastructure: CI/CD, networking, security, etc. TLDR; The number of openings for MLE, DS, DE are low because most companies are unwilling to invest into data, and even less willing to invest into ML infra and the upkeep required for industry-specific R&D.",

He's also just a wonderful person in general, incredibly friendly and can talk for hours. I dread the day he decides to finally retire because of the immense loss it will be.",

Also, scale is not always just about human users - it’s not hard to imagine an application that has to make hundreds or thousands of calls just to service a single request, that is also a form of scale. Especially in the age of AI agents, this is becoming fairly routine. Alternatively, imagine some cloud storage solution like DropBox which one day might be asked to upload/download a 100 KB file and the next day asked to upload/download a 1 TB file. That is an enormous range of potential payload sizes which itself is another form of scale and brings its own unique challenges.So “scale” comes in many different flavors. But to your specific question, …> are people who have handled scale actually more skilled?… the answer is emphatically “yes”.Anyone can write a basic CRUD app that is functional, where “functional” simply means it doesn’t break. But to optimize an application for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance at large scale? That typically requires years of experience to understand the tradeoffs and foresee bottlenecks before they throttle you.Depending on your subfield, handling traffic at scale may also require not simply writing performant code but also using specialized tooling that you’d have no reason to learn at lower scale.So yes, developing at scale requires significant skills beyond what your run-of-the-mill dev will bring to the table.",

Disclaimer: Talking about the jobs I've had, I'm sure there are jobs where the programming is new / novel enough for that to be the main difficulty in the day-to-day work, but for me the times I've had to write truly hard code is rare, and almost always as a result of a poor architecture / up front decision. Most of the time the code does feel trivial to me.I've been programming so long that I can't even help new programmers all that much. I can mentor an eager junior or mid level, but my friend who wants to pick up programming and career switch I'm just so far removed from how I had to learn when I was 12 that I can't really empathize and my explanations would probably do more harm than good because I operate at a much higher level by default.",

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. I imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. From the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. I think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. Another option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. Wish I had even better advise. I think it's universally agreed on that getting the first development job is the hardest. One you land that, it'll still be hard, but maybe not as hard as the first time.",

Which makes you stop learning new things, and growing. If you stay in such a job for to long, you get numb, stagnant, and pretty much a zombie. A new job might suck just as much after, lets say 12 months, till then you at least get to know a new code base, new setup, new ideas (sometimes bad ideas). If you don't take the chance of maybe finding something that you like doing, you end up as a zombie, waiting for the bell to ring anyway. Do not let salary alone dictate what a good job is. If you hate it, it costs you more than 15% more salary in the long term. I'm not advocating for \"work for peanuts because you like the work\" either. But if you work in a bank, and you fucking hate the environment, then don't work in the financial sector anymore, even thou they tend to pay better.Find a happy balance between work and your life.

You can always pivot later. Game dev is hard, and I’ve known many game devs who switched to a “normal” swe job later with great success. Going the other way is not as common.

Probably not (unless you're trying to break into game dev).Will it hurt you? Probably not.It *could* tangentially help you by way of building skills you might otherwise not use and strengthening fundamentals like DS&A. Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.But everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.Game dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).TL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it. Edit: and you'll probably get lots of conflicting answers here. Were I interviewing you, I'd be **very** interested in your hypothetical game dev journey because of my own interest. Win some, lose some. It's a shitty market no matter what so find something to just keep you learning but not burned out.",

It took me years to get my engineering career launched properly.You might think about getting into a Tech-adjacent field, like SW sales/marketing/management, something that doesn't require in-depth and current knowledge of coding, but still has good pay and career prospects.",

When I began, I was working primarily in Android development where I would work in Java and some additional Python scripts for automation. Then I worked on another project where I was mainly doing Python and some PowerShell and Bash scripting. After that, I did Python for a while but got exposed to microservice architecture, and found myself working a whole lot with Docker, RabbitMQ, and various other technologies.Afterwards I pivoted again to a new project which was more web-centric, and found myself developing using Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for our frontend.Another pivot, and I spent quite some time doing Data Science/Analytics for numerous stakeholders; during this time I found myself writing numerous SQL queries, working a lot in Jupyter Notebook in Python, and also dabbling in Machine Learning.My most recent pivot I've been working with Django to build a web service, and again working with microservice architecture, and doing a whole lot of database work again.My transitions have been quite extreme over the last several years, going from embedded systems, to data science/ML, to web development, and so on. I feel the same way in the sense that I don't know if I have much of a specialization either, but it's nice to be able to learn so much!",

Rather, it sounds like you want the opposite and gain more exposure on modern tech stacks?It doesn’t hurt to try to interview other companies if you can.

Research and apply to every internship you can find; I've noticed there isn't a huge internship grind among comp sci students. Building those connections and gaining experience is huge to finding a job. Also, have a wider view of your career expectations. There is a lot of work that doesn't fit the typical mold like service desk or support analyst jobs but can really help you connect with stakeholders and build management experience. In line with that and as general advice, make yourself flexible and don't feel like you can only focus on one aspect of the field.

There was an open role on their careers page so I applied. The new role is hybrid, but so is my current one, so I don’t mind the setup. It took a few weeks of applying to many places to get a recruiter call request, and then about two months from there to get the offer letter.I worry that recruiters at larger companies might filter you out early on if they can’t easily map your experience to their open roles. If you have the chance to transfer internally, that might be your best shot.You will most likely need to work on-site in some capacity. You might have to build toward a role that aligns with your interests. This is my third position, and the first that actually aligns with mine.

If they use a 3rd party recruiter and just hire you right on full time they pay a fee of like 30% of your starting salary. CTH allows them to essentially amortize this cost by employing you on a contract basis. Instead of a large fee the recruiting company profits off the spread of what they you and what they charge. It also allows them to make sure you’re a good fit before just dumping 50k on someone who may not work out.",

If you noticed, there’s already only a couple Infra/Systems guys in an IT dept as it is. That’s not going to change. My department has 3 and then the number of devs we have is like 40. AI will trim the number of SWEs for many organizations, if it hasn’t already, NOT as dramatically as Infra was by virtualization and IaC, but there’s no lower level devs anymore in my org. Just mid to senior. Who knows, my org may be able to do the work of the 40 SWEs with 25-30 in a few years, there will still be 3 Infra guys though.To add, most companies are not full on automation either. There are still many several traditional companies that don’t have a need for IaC like larger companies. This will also be downvoted, but a lot of SWEs really can’t do Infra work….. I’m just being honest. There’s a lot more than standing up servers, app services, etc. They’re definitely safe lmao.",

There might be those who join and find a job, which is great!

An unhappy person could really ruin this for people trying to help or people trying to get their foot in the door.Would love to see this fleshed out more, I would love to volunteer my time in a more lead/manager position since that is something I'd be interested in exploring as a full time IC as well, especially since I have experience with mentorship.",

Every interviewer is different, but I'd like to think your current answer isn't a single deal-breaker, but maybe one issue among several. We can debate if you want people who are more well-rounded individuals with better work-life balance vs people who are more \"passionate\" about work, but it ultimately boils down to who is interviewing you. It doesn't matter what some online collective decides. It might also just be case that another candidate came off looking better for whatever reason. From a human perspective, it's great that you have balance, etc. But from a work perspective, there are likely people who will prefer someone who may bring more work value. I cringe a bit as I type that, but hopefully you get my point. A person's personality and values can certainly improve and add value to a company, but I was recently in some crunch mode on a project, and a few new devs decided they wanted work-life balance. It's good for them to set boundaries, but it can also make things more difficult. I'm trying to balance doing what's right vs what is sometimes practical.",

If you ARE expected to manage him but he's not skilled enough to contribute, just give him some poorly defined busywork like \"make suggestions to improve the UI\" or \"read through the codebase until you feel you understand it\". In the case that he eventually asks for more substantive things to do, just give him the smallest thing that your team needs done that's hard to mess up.

Or they need several hints for what boils down to basic string manipulation (check if a string is alphanumeric), not even DS&A assessment. We can’t honestly recommend someone to our manager who can’t problem solve or code through a short problem without AI assistance/google. And then there’s a good chunk of candidates that are just obviously cheating and even some not obvious but our tools picked up so those are instant no call backs. It’s bizarre because if they just said they didn’t know an answer to a question or tried to reason through the problem honestly we would be totally fine and maybe even pass them so long as they communicated clearly.",

Learn foundational stuff like how the request response cycle works, how web frameworks are structured, etc. Maybe find an online course that walks you through learning/implementing stuff/projects/frameworks.Edit: and learn to debug properly!

Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn. If you are serious about wanting to become a better engineer and focus on that, in time you will.",

        "body": "OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads. ##what does that mean for you?QA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. ##ExamplesLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. For ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry. A lot will even take non-students (helping Columbia with their research actually landed me at Microsoft without an application)Wanna do QA? Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles. Don't even gotta apply just start and get paid like uber. ##Bottom lineIt's very doable, it's just not as \"easy\" as it was before. And believe it or not, most people for most well paid industries have to do this exact same thing.Edit: assuming you are willing to move to a tech hub... or at least apply to jobs with a address / PO box in a tech hub",

Even if you make it past these alleged AI filters, the minute a human sees an AI-oriented resume, they're going to throw it away anyways.I've never once thought about those things. I write a resume that effectively communicates my experience in a very concise way meant to pull the reader in. I've never thought about keywords, I've never thought about metrics/impact/numbers, I've never thought about AI or ATS.A good resume is a good resume.If you're not getting bites, you should be focusing on what's wrong with your resume, not how to get past \"filters\".SWE resume writing is actually a pretty well defined task. Our resumes are *technical documents*. And how to write a technical document is a full on field of study called Tech Comm. Many CS degrees have several tech comm courses in them. If you study what makes a good resume, by studying Tech Comm and what makes a good technical document, the interviews will follow. That's something that a lot of people overlook. And the rules of tech comm would *never* suggest you keyword spam to get around some AI.So that's my advice. Learn what makes a resume good (without asking others for anecdotal advice). Don't operate on the assumption that your resume is already good and focus on trying to find some sort of other problem outside your control like AI or other resume filters.",

While I understand that you worked as a contractor, based on this an ATS system will flag your average time at jobs as just a few months. It might be worth trying to find a way to group some of these together- There's some extreme gaps on the resume (including the last 8 months even). It would be helpful if you could address that somewhere by filling in the blanks with projects, classes, etc. Or maybe you could reframe your summary for this purpose, since currently I don't think that's well utilized space for what it is.- A lot of the bullet points aren't very detailed.

I feel like all I am really good at is fixing stuff, debugging, and doing deep in the weeds technical shit regarding the containers, deployments, etcAnswering your question with my extremely unqualified opinion, I think you're fine.

Everywhere I've worked has expected teams to maintain their own data pipelines if they need them. At only one of those companies were there teams that didn't need any.Being able to demonstrate that you can pick up random tasks and skills with aplomb will serve you well.",
