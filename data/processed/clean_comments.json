I find SQL is perfect for tables building and pivoting especially if it involves things that mostly revolve around filtering, grouping, sorting etc. whereas Python is great for automating steps, cleaning data and doing any sort of stats or ML.Beyond the things that Python can do that are wonky with Python (like visualizations), which probably isn't applicable to your job, Python has a ton of really great libraries and tools to clean data, parse fields, run stats and ML models etc. I think perhaps the risk in your role that I suspect others here might point out is that you're probably dealing with large volumes of data and you need to be careful when working with Python in that scenario. For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",

So what do I use it for in data engineering: 1) building simple scraper scripts that can run in most environments as Python is very popular; 2) more traditional ETLs such as from blob storage to some data warehouse. But there many other applications but these are the common ones.",

I say sorry they have to do it, but I would be completely unable to keep track of what needs doing otherwise, and that it's also important so my manager has visibility of the workload. All of which is true. If people repeatedly try to give me work via Teams or email, after a couple of clear reminders of the process, I just start ignoring them. I also emphasise that the ticket needs to include meaningful context that will help me prioritise it against other things - I freely acknowledge that there are a lot of other things competing for my attention, and am clear that I'm not choosing favourites, my goal is always to simply be doing whatever is highest benefit to the company overall. Nobody can really disagree with that without sounding bad themselves. So in specifics, I expect every ticket to give me an idea of how much time it's going to save someone, or how much revenue it'll bring in, or what revenue we'll lose if it's not done by a certain date, etc. If the ticket doesn't, I ask for this info via the ticketing system and it goes on hold until I have it.",

And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.BUT...Data engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. And within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.The same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. Ditto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. Another angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",

There will also be a part where you talk about your experience and answer questions like “tell me a time when you recently identified a data cleaning issue” or something like that. Also it’s just a grab bag: some interviewers will be super chill and trust you when explaining your experience and the depth of it. Others won’t and then will ask you incredibly specific technical questions (eg where do you find parquet metadata in delta tables. I’ve found these types of questions typically came from Indian people sorry to generalize but it might help you). Anyways good luck",

Expect stuff like \"how would you model this entity relationship\" or \"write a query that joins these tables and does X aggregation\" 2. System design - you'll get asked to design a batch/streaming pipeline for some scenario. Know your Kafka vs Kinesis, star schema vs snowflake, batch vs micro-batch trade-offs.3. Take-home - these suck but common. Usually building a small ETL pipeline with test data. I had one where I had to build a pipeline that transformed reddit comments into a star schema and ran some basic analyses.4. Behavioral - standard stuff but focus on data quality, testing, and how you've handled data issues.Best advice: brush up on SQL window functions and Python data structures. Also be ready to talk about data quality - every company is obsessed with this right now. I've interviewed \\~25 DE candidates this quarter and most fail on basic stuff like explaining partitioning strategies or handling late-arriving data.",

Every interview I got was the result of replying to recruiter messages in LinkedIn.Most of them were actually pretty good offers but the recruiter used some out of the box AI spam message so it looked sketchy as fuck. You had to have a call with them to figure out whether the offer was good.The actual interview loop mostly echoed everyone else in the comments.1. Phone screen2. Technical. Usually SQL heavy, some python. Most places didn't use a real platform like leetcode, they were instead conversational. This was a much better format at real tech companies and a MUCH MUCH worse format at wannabe tech companies, they were very \"magic word\" centric.3. Multiple panel interviews, at least one behavioral. Similar experience above, tech companies and dinosaur boomer corps were much more fluid and conversational. \"Tech\" companies were once again an awful experience. I failed a 5th round team matching interview because I mentioned DB2 literally one time. Got a rejection saying they were looking for someone with more experience.

The Elastic License in fusion blocks hosting competitors and could be interpreted as discouraging anyone from extending the tool. For example, if a company like Altimate tried to build a dbt Power User extension using dbt Fusion, or if someone modified fusion to get around rent-seeking restrictions set by dbt Labs, those efforts could be seen as competition and could result in account suspensions or bans, if not legal action.2. The requirement to authenticate in the VS Code extension, along with its acceptable use policy, seems aimed at identifying medium- and large-sized organizations using the free tools and pushing them toward buying a cloud license.This isn’t just about drawing a line between core and cloud — it looks like an intentional effort to murder core without causing too much backlash. People have already noticed that development on core has slowed down significantly over the past year. At this rate, it wouldn’t be surprising if core quietly disappears in the next few years since it will inevitably be a challenge/infeasible to maintain both moving forward.",

A few things: 1. dbt-core is not going away! Have you seen the [dbt Core roadmap we published yesterday](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/docs/roadmap/2025-05-new-engine-same-language.md)? It talks about our plans to continue supporting and adding functionality to dbt Core. 2. Totally understand having some questions about the ELv2 License. [You can read more here](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine), but the gist of it is as you can adopt it, use it, share it, modify it, all without talking to us or registering at all. The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future. You can check out [this post for more details](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components), but I'd be really curious to hear what's on your mind!",

If you really need every ounce of performance, write the giant query, but you can generally make pipelines much easier to read and maintain while getting acceptable performance.My bigger issue with dbt is the invocation / scheduling overhead that can be difficult to see and extremely impactful on performance. My team uses Airflow and k8s, and we've had to refine guidelines on building DAGs a lot. Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline. We ended up consolidating models into a small handful of tasks, which reduced runtime by 25%.",

Having managed and dealt with fully driven sql ETL solutions, one can see the performance benefits and the performance pain points. Separating those concerns between db and app helps to determine what type of tool you need. I’m generally dealing with a significant volume of transformation and mapping logic, to consume a hundred different pictures of sources routing to the same final destinations. This part has never done well in sql server, and we won’t even get in to the concerns on flexibility, scalability, and bloat, to use sql server for this particular piece of the paradigm, if it is a concern you are even battling. If not, I’d argue in favor of something basic, and full sql can be totally fine in this regard. But if you are some enterprise level organization in some field of work with lots of data interchange and very little in the way of rules to enforce contracts, your transformation part of ETL will become king.",

It’s just not as good especially with complex join and prone to OOM. There is one other trait in clickhouse that I would like to share but it’s only relevant for clickhouse cloud since idk if the same architecture is applicable in self-hosted clickhouse.",

You need to microbatch them.\\> Do S3 Tables' optimizations actually solve the small files and concurrency issues?I optimize via trino and not via S3 Tables. The procedure should be similar. You need to adjust the optimization timeline to avoid spending too much time on the optimization procedure and eventually colliding with other table commits.\\> Am I overcomplicating by suggesting separate operational/analytical stores?IMO yes. Iceberg should be able to accomodate a heavy write load and most OLAP necessities, granted that you have a good query engine on top like Dremio, Trino, Starburst, etc. You can segregate and organize tables in separate schemas/databases and use a data catalog to keep everything in check.Only if you need near real time freshness and low latency reads you should consider a separate datastore.As with everything YMMV",

This is neither large scale, nor slow moving data.Similar concept would work if each \"service\" dumped million records once an hour (and I'd say give each its own table) but this is a complete mismatch what the technology is for.Now what your colleagues are correct about is that CDC is pretty complex business and if you really have no need for real-time data, you might be better off with periodic dumps.

Anyone who tells you they know what's going to happen in the industry over the next 5-10 years is probably wrong. AI will be a disruptor. How significant that disruption will be and what form it takes is still very much a question mark. Turning towards more soft skills with job titles like \"Data Architect\" may insulate you somewhat from that disruption, but as I said, predicting the next few years is very difficult. 3. If you want a masters, do it because you like the subject area and you want to learn about it. If it costs too much then get a hold of the syllabi and read the materials. As someone who hires engineers, masters degrees mean very little to me. Comp sci education is very often a 5 years or more behind current technology and practices unless faculty are direct from the industry. Being 5 years behind in other disciplines is not a big deal. In our industry it makes a massive difference.",

This is probably the only perspective I can offer that's materially different, although it's a very different experience compared to a Masters. IMO, the main practical benefit of a PhD is no one will ever suggest you should get more formal education. It probably has made my resume stand out a bit, although I suspect that's a function of the institution brand plus the degree. I think of it more as an unexpected personal/life experience thing first, as opposed to a professional consideration.",

Having a good mentor can help steer your own career. Working in FAANG it shouldn't be difficult to find one and they don't always need to be within your own reporting lines.- Teach, don't do. You'll find yourself a lot just fixing juniors problems but not solving the underlying issue. The teach a man to fish anecdote is so applicable and you'll feel less uncomfortable with them struggling. Failure is a part of learning so treat it like that for them.- Be informally formal. Imposter syndrome at your age is always rife and I too had the same issue. I ended up on a training course for working at an enterprise level and raised the same challenge with the trainer. The main learning was reading the situation and being yourself where applicable. The imposter syndrome is hard to shake but it'll get easier with time.- Most importantly, make time for yourself and your own development. You'll find yourself putting more time on others and taking a leading role. However don't forget to take your training days and learn. Good luck!",

If you can define success and measure it, you can reliably hit it. You can also quantify your success to your stakeholders and increase the trust. Good things to measure are: * SLA availability/uptime* MTTA/MTTR for any pipeline failures* reconciliation (are all records captured from point A present at point Z)* number of errors * costif you can measure these few things, you can describe to your stakeholders the value that you add. It's really transformational to measure yourself. Even if you are consistently shit and not hitting appropriate benchmarks, you can highlight to management that you need more resources.

So much simpler than trying to keep data transformation routines in pandas-based projects.* Unless you really need specific features from dbt cloud (say, the graphQL API on top of semantic models), I'd just self-host. It's easy and any DE team should be able to do it without much hassle.* In my previous job (small shop, leading a small team), I considered implementing dbt for a couple of years before actually doing it and absolutely regret the wait.

I don't think the cloud offering is always a huge gain, but it helped some of the less technical people on the team run processes in testing more easily. We also gained a bunch from mesh, since we had a few projects (eg one for silver and one for gold models). The explorer feature was also nice to have, but wouldn't be a deciding factor. Overall, things like macros, tests, Jinja, etc, were also fine. You could find other ways to do them in other frameworks, but they're useful in many ways and you can implement a lot without much lift.",

Before it was spaghetti SQL files with no clear dependencies. Most useful features: ref(), tests, and documentation are actually worth it. Sources and macros are heavily used. Exposures were nice in theory but nobody maintained them. Snapshots were a mess - ended up just building those in our warehouse directly.Orchestration: Airflow + dbt is still clunky. We have our dbt DAG inside Airflow but then need to manually sync when dependencies change. If I started today, I'd use Dagster since it has first-class dbt integration.For non-technical folks: The lineage graphs in dbt Cloud are nice but rarely used by stakeholders in my experience. They still just message the data team.Challenges: The learning curve for non-SQL people is steep, especially with macros and Jinja. Performance became a bottleneck with 500+ models. dbt Cloud's git workflow is rigid compared to local dev.Would I adopt again? Yes, but with caveats. I'd set much stricter conventions up front and would consider something like preswald for the Python+SQL parts since our ML engineers hate the dbt workflow. We use it for a recommender system where we need both pandas for user clustering and SQL for joining with sales data - that cross-language part is where dbt falls short.",

The most impactful changes I've seen are around collaboration and code quality - `ref()` functions eliminated our hard coded table names, builtin testing catches data quality issues early, and version control became natural. The documentation generation and lineage tracking have improved our communication, though the semantic layer features are still maturing and often feel overhyped.The real challenges I've encountered emerge around orchestration and performance at scale. While dbt handles transformation DAGs elegantly, integrating with Airflow required planning to avoid duplicate logic and scheduling conflicts. For managing data from multiple sources, I've found that solutions like Windsor.ai simplify the upstream, consolidating data from various APIs and platforms.Given your junior team's situation, I'd recommend starting with dbt Cloud despite the cost, the GUI, builtin scheduler, and easier onboarding reduce the learning curve compared to Core's CLI-heavy workflow. SQLMesh is promising but still early stage, most teams I know would adopt dbt again, but with better upfront planning around testing strategies, macro organization, and clear governance policies.",

Sure you can make your own framework, use stored procs, spark, etc, but in the end you will be the only one using that vs the thousands of orgs already using dbt.I don't see many people using dbt features that were not there like in version 1.0 or 1.5. For example, not many people using versioned models, unit testing, etc.What people do use; docs, lineage, data testing, and the bread and butter of dbt; snapshots, incremental models, etc.All this being said, dbt alone isn't gonna fix anything. The teams that realize the best outcomes change more than the tech. They add things like CI/CD, implementing tools like SQLFluff, dbt-checkpoint, etc. They rethink the whole process not just adding dbt. You also need to worry about improving how data is modeled, because that will have a big impact as well.Many people do use Airflow with dbt including people on dbt Cloud. Why? because the dbt Cloud scheduler is pretty limited. Airflow is the market leader hands down.I have seen large teams work with dbt well and I have seen small teams work with it poorly. Sometimes this is due to their philosophical differences. e.g. not letting dbt manage the dependencies but trying to manually recreate them in Airflow. As for dbt Cloud pricing, it can be an issue as teams grow. Their teams level is limited to one project and up to 8 users, so that becomes an issue when teams pass those limits because prices jump quite high.Google \"dbt alternatives\" or \"dbt cloud vs dbt Core\", lots of resources out there. This week there has been a lot of chatter about dbt Fusion, but if is not feature complete yet IMO and very Snowflake centric. The licensing restrictions will mean many people won't adopt it any time soon. Would I use it today, probably, there is a wealth of information out there on dbt, a big community, a large ecosystem, but I would also consider other options like SQLMesh which has a more open licensing model and even their VS Code extension is better than dbt's because that one requires registering with dbt cloud and it is limited to 15 users.",

Obviously you can do your own research and see what we have implemented and compare it to what's publicly available for dbt.SQLGlot, the library behind SQLMesh's SQL understanding has the same \"3 levels\" as Fusion / SDF. We just take slightly different approaches. SQLGlot can parse 20+ dialects. https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/parser.pyIt has type inference and logical planning.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/optimizer/annotate_types.pyhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/planner.pyIt even has a Python based physical execution engine.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/executor/python.pyAt the end of the day, there's been a big media brigade by dbt trying to hype up catching up to us. But it's the equivalent of boasting about making your GPS (compile time of SQL) when your engine is still slow (run time and execution of SQL). dbt core + fusion still doesn't have state. There's no scheduling / cron. So although they can now validate SQL queries, it still can't do something as simple as remembering what days of data your transformations has run for or when it should run. Compile time of SQL queries really should only take a couple of seconds, so they're solving a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place. You're spending minutes/hours, thousands of dollars running queries on your warehouse, and SQLMesh is significantly more advanced there.Happy to chat any time, give me a ping.",

Without their participation, it would be an exercise in futility, if not a tremendous waste of time, trying to find the metaphorical \"one piece\" treasure, without any knowledge of what and where it is. Debugging would also be a nightmare too. That said, often only money talks when dealing with these (cost centre type) stakeholders. Without which, things tend to be stalemated when there are insufficient carrots given.Also being able to convince your managers to invest the time and effort to document your work and knowledge is a vital life skill. Documentation is often in short supply, and recommiting the original sin of insufficient documentation is an act of self sabotage. This also makes onboarding any new staff and creates a key man risk problem which makes leave coverage more challenging than it already is too.Bottom line: Organisational management and people skills are vital.Best of luck out there.",

I use Iceberg with Spark, Trino, Snowflake at work. Iceberg works really well with Spark, other client drivers usually are behind.5. Maintanance of small files, compaction, etc [see these docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/maintenance/#delete-orphan-files)I haven't used Singlestore but do not expect OLTP(or clickhouse like speeds from Iceberg.IMO its helpful to avoid vendor lock in (althought I am usually doubtful of these claims, since most vendor data can be dumped out into parquet, or some common standard).As for time travel, its definitely helpful. I've also used SCD2 and kept fact table entries as non immutable past certain lookback time with an etl_inserted column to eseential do time travel (think processing ts column).I'd really nail down the requirements, what does time travel mean to your use case, why do you need it, any other way to easily get what you are looking for? And what is fast mean (under 10s, under subsecond) can you optimize your query to make current system faster; Iceberg will not magically make your queries faster.Hope this helps, lmk if you have any questions.",

Airflow does get more complex when you have a lot of dependencies between dags, unique scheduling, dependencies on external factors, branching, etc. But for basic cron-style scheduling it's very straightforward, and the current UI is a significant improvement over the past.

It's a pure orchestration tool, doesnt try convince you otherwise, runs everything, plugs into everything, has fantastic dbt integration. Some odd configuration requirements, but setting up the Schedules etc is very easy.Prefect, is my personal favourite, does orchestration and does it very well, has awesome support for some complex implementations, works well with any python package you decide to run, i personally like dlt or polar. Dagster, its an incredibly powerful tool, it has some incredibly features like sensors and automaterialization, however, the amount of fuck around to do some things like complicated incremental loads is a headache, especially because the way it's been designed almost forcing you to do things a certain way.I dont like the amount of inline written sql in dagsters documentation, seems like a huge fuckin liability ah, this should be handled through schema drift detection, it should be more flexible in that sense like dlt is, so easy to set up incremental loads, use state to prevent additional loads of already processed records.It feels like a serious amount of vendor lock in, im sure the software devs love it, because they want the intense finetuned control, but it'll become a headache long term.I also find retrieving data real time from the database to control current loads via looking for gaps in data or controlling max or min dates ranges for countries for example is much easier in dlt which works better with prefect or airflow mo.Dagster is amazing, I still use it, im keen to get more experienced but fuck me the documentation feels messy, 100 ways to do everything, constantly running into \"that's the old way\" It seems like a bloated tool... and that's compared to airflow which has been around more than twice as long.I'd go with prefect or airflow unless the team are software devs, they'll prefer dagster but it'll become a huge liability when the team grows imo",

It handles Python + SQL, builds DAGs, has versioning capabilities through assets, and provides a clean UI for visualizing those DAGs. The lineage tracking is solid and deployment is way less painful than Airflow. For your text processing case, I've used it to run spaCy pipelines on product reviews that feed into Postgres - works great because you define everything as assets and Dagster handles the dependency resolution.If you're looking for something more lightweight, preswald might work too - it's open-source and handles the Python + SQL combo well. I use it for our NLP pipelines where we extract entities from news articles, transform with Python, then load to Postgres. You can build the lineage visually and it handles versioning through git. Much simpler setup than the Airflow/dbt combo we had before that required two separate systems for the sql vs python parts.",

While it isn’t a database and is just a query engine, that can be a feature although it may seem like a deficiency.The separation of ingestion + landing of data and reading from it can be nice since you don’t have to worry about the noisy neighbor problem (aka large queries monopolizing resources)Again, ClickHouse will work and really any OLAP will work (Apache Druid or Pinot). What it’ll come down to are performance requirements and maintainability.Personally I’d give ClickHouse a go first as that will be the most streamlined approach. However, a separate ingestion engine -> s3 + catalog <- read with Trino could be a more scalable and cost effective approach.",

Right now I'm taking an entrepreneurial class that's helping me refine my pitch in my financial forecasting models and stuff like that. My idea much like your own is that analyst team still spend a lot of time doing data prep writing connectors. I've been doing it for so long that I can pretty much do it with my eyes closed so I would love to build a system you know that's managed version controlled it's got row level security, everything is a description attached to it easy to use for anybody including non-technical people. So far I've got one client, but they are a bit more involved it's helping me keep afloat in the meantime. They pay 5,000 usd monthly and do a lot of things manually have a lot of data sources that are pretty complicated Don't have API connector stuff like that. I've got lots of insights but no diamonds yet. At first I tried really small businesses like Mom and Pop shops around town, it was really hard to educate them and also they have no money. Some other key things I learned is that in person referrals are worth their weight in gold if someone else can sing your praises then the person that they're singing to doesn't really need to do any further validation that you will be able to solve their problems. This is hand in hand with finding complimentary businesses that might need to outsource their work. So if you can meet with as many people who do similar work they may eventually have work for you. The other thing is social media if you can manage to figure out what your customers paying points are specifically and then regularly make content around it that may produce leads for years to come. I suppose alternatively completely cold outreach has not worked for me yet. I tried messaging on LinkedIn I've tried to emailing people, mind you not in the hundreds but rather and let's say the tens. But still 0% response rate on any of that and most of the time you just get ignored. After a lot of talking and thinking I realized that I'm really trying to solve my own problem as an analyst for so many years. So I'm doing a micro pivot and trying to focus on helping maybe slightly technical marketing teams or analyst and scientist teams that struggle with disconnected data sources and they would like a modeled data warehouse as a service. Including all of the business metrics reports dashboards The whole works. My pricing is pretty similar to yours, depending on the number of data sources I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of 4,000 to $10,000 for a setup, and then a retainer feed to manage everything going forwards anywhere from you know 500 to $5,000. If you or anyone else would be interested in talking virtually or even starting a discord or something that could be cool! My website is DataSeed.ca, but fyi it still reflects my soft launch and hasn't been updated in a while.",

The general flow is:Find clients: Upwork Upwork has significantly declined in volume and quality of clients lately so unsure if this route is still ok for beginners. In ODesk times and the earlier days of Upwork it was way easier to find quality clients. I worked for a very large well known production studio after slogging through lower quality clients in the beginning. Once you find clients you can start to build relationships with the good ones, and you'll start to get referrals from them to others. Pricing: Don't do flat pricing with new clients. Charge per hour and then once a relationship is built you can discuss flat pricing. Overall most clients think of things in terms of \"If I pay X, I get Y\". As engineers/analysts we know it doesn't work that way (bugs come up, requirements change mid-project etc.) but when you have discussions around pricing try to build in this uncertainty when you make hourly estimates. Anything longer than a 30 min intro discussion gets billed. Pitfalls: \\-\"I don't have a budget\" does not mean they have no budget, it means they don't have enough technical background to know what something takes and haven't done any due diligence to try to ballpark it. \\-Intense technical grilling at the onset of the discussion. I've found that clients that do this are the opposite of the above client. You will never appease them because they think they've figured it all out and if you deviate from their plan they'll get upset. \\-\"Ideas\" clients. Sometimes a client will come with some vague idea of what they want. They won't be able to answer even the most basic questions because they want you to fill in the gap. Again they haven't done the due diligence to know what they need and if you contract with them they'll expect you to build their business and get mad when you don't do things that are out of scope. Hope this helps.",

While your current role might not feel like pure data engineering, it is still giving you valuable exposure to tools and processes that are widely used in the field.Writing ingestion scripts in PySpark and creating views for analysts may seem simple, but these tasks are part of a much bigger pipeline. You are interacting with Databricks and the lakehouse architecture, which many companies are still trying to implement. This means you're in a strong position to understand modern data workflows from the inside.If you're concerned about limited learning opportunities, try exploring what surrounds your current tasks. Ask about the scheduling systems they use for ingestion, whether it's something like Airflow or another orchestration tool. Learn how they handle data quality and transformation. These areas can give you new learning opportunities without needing to change your role immediately.For self learning, continue strengthening your Python and SQL skills. Then branch out by focusing on the tech you're already exposed to. Look deeper into Spark optimization, Delta Lake, and how Databricks operates in cloud environments. You can also study data pipeline orchestration using tools like Airflow or Prefect. Tools like dbt are also helpful for managing transformations.If you prefer structure, try building a small personal data project. For example, collect data with Python, store it in a cloud database, process it using PySpark or Pandas, and visualize it using a dashboard tool like Streamlit or Power BI. This hands-on work will connect the dots and show you how the tools work together.The internship you have now is just a stepping stone. You are not stuck.

I still write simple PySpark jobs where the file is less than 20 lines with include statements and I still make simple dashboards for our employees and execs. Your goal shouldn't be to be a full-blown data engineer by the end of your first internship. You need to focus firstly on executing your tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter how simple, and putting the people you're working with at ease about the quality of your work. This will encourage them to give you larger and more complex tasks which will increase your rate of learning more than requesting exposure to X or Y tool. Also take every opportunity to ask your seniors the why and how questions of the tools they're using. Patience and baby steps, knowledge will come to you before you realize you have it.",

So technically the DS is kind of the DE's client so to speak. There is overlap and collaboration but the DE sets up the data so that the DS can then use that data. Not sure about how the job market compares but I think it's safe to say that both aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Good luck!",

So data engineering has always had more opportunity as business are looking to move their data into cloud systems, just not ready for various reasons yet to go further with the data. The same is for data governance roles and perhaps even devOps, here at least most businesses are looking to hire experienced individuals who are willing to take on that particular role. I could be wrong here but this has been my analysis from friends who are senior data engineers in big corporate companies. Now that I have my masters in data science, I’ve gone ahead and done my azure data fundamentals, data bricks lake house certification as well as data bricks associate data engineering certification to make me ready for any graduate positions",

Whether the insight from data requires a dedicated DS team or DA/BI, that's the question. DS is more interesting for sure but in a corporate environment you are always going to struggle to enjoy it. It really depends on how much faith company puts in a DS team.DS generally has a lot of uncertainty and requires lot of justification to exist in a company. There are some fields like marketing and adtech where DS have more defined problems to solve. Otherwise lot of the times you are struggling to have quality data to provide business value that some DA/BI team can't already. Lot of DS roles these days have merged with ML engineer role. So I would say make a choice between DE or ML engineer. In general closer you are you to the engineering team in the company, safer your job would be. With DS that's not always the case.",

We only did PoCs with ClickHouse and Starrocks - I'd say those are kind of \"second generation real-time OLAP\" where Druid and Pinot are first generation. The difference between the \"generations\" seems to be mostly operational, and also ClickHouse and Starrocks can also do data transformation, while Pinot and Druid seem to expect the data goes out mostly in the same form as it goes in.The data transformation is also the key challenge, as for the data to be transformed you have to translate the logic into materialized views, which have some limitations. If you're mostly \"adding data to a pile\" with some aggregations and small joins, that can be done relatively easily. If you have multi-layer data warehouse style model with complex logic, it might get complicated, and that is where we got stuck.",

Currently evaluating ducklake with high hopes for realtime ingestionI wish iceberg supported secondary indexes. AWS’s recommendation for search is to pipe data into open search. We’ll probably constrain users to only search over the last few days (works for our use case) and take advantage of icebergs sorting so we dont have to do that. Trying to keep things simple",

If you’re willing to learn, you can leverage this opportunity into your next professional step. You mentioned you are working for some sports team. I think the easiest way to approach this project is to post on this subreddit, and the businessintelligence subreddit asking if anyone is willing to mentor you on building out this project, and make sure to mention what sport industry you are in. I know for me, i love american football and would not mind contributing to help a team at whatever level on their analytical journey for free. Now, don’t expect free work, but you can expect some guidance from people that do this for a living.You have a ton to learn on your own. Find some mentors. They’ll be able to cut your work in half if you put in the work.",

On top of that on the application layer it was not noticeable, and on the back end it made it really hard to see what descriptions were being used in the metadata.

My company has DEs who do nothing but manage Kafka infrastructure, and there are others who are doing almost exclusively dbt modeling. The learning paths for those roles are completely different. I'll assume you want something more general.If you have a passion project and time, it's a little easier to build out a coherent training plan, since you have something concrete to work toward. For example, if you're really into sportsball, you can find a place to get sportsball data, extract it on some cadence, transform it, maybe do some simple ML on it, and then visualize the whole thing. That gets you:1. Extraction patterns. This can be DIY Python scripts or an ETL tool like dlt or Airbyte2. Scheduling and orchestration. Maybe it's as simple as cron jobs, or maybe you'll stand up Dagster or Airflow3. Database management. You can probably comfortably do everything in DuckDB, but if you want to get fancy, you can use a single-node Spark cluster to write out to Iceberg or some other table format4. Data modeling. Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction6. Visualization. Make a dashboard. There are a billion tools out there, both OSS and proprietary: Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Lightdash, or Superset are just a few. Pick one and make a dashboard to help you understand the data you've extracted and transformed7. Optional: A lot of this stuff can be managed either via cloud resources or locally-run via containers. There's a lot of opportunity to learn about cloud infra, IAC, and CI / CD",

So , from my experience having both backend and devops knowledge is a huge plus for data engineering roles. Backend basics is anyhow crud and you can learn easily.

A lot depends on what exactly the image is doing and how you are running it. I'd recommend only building the environment in the image and don't bake the code into the image directly. Use a volume (or bind) mount or a side car to expose your code to the container at runtime. Something like git-sync makes this easy but there are a lot of different ways to handle it. Now your version updates to the base image decreases substantiality, reducing build time and storage costs. It becomes much more practical to store many versions of the image. This has other benefits as well. Want to upgrade one pipeline to a new version? Just pin a new image version to the job. Testing becomes significantly easier by disconnecting the two pieces. Good advice when running in production is never rely on the 'latest' tag, always pin your dependencies. That goes for images as well as Python packages. tl;dr - Mount code to an image, don't build a new one every time. Pin your dependencies",

Your image should behave exactly the same way regardless of what server it runs on, that's the entire point of containers. This does differ from the approach you would take if you were building something like an API or a Django web app. In that case rebuild the image every time, for a lot of different reasons you wouldn't volume mount code in this case.For data pipelines there really isn't a good reason to do so. Build your python environment and install your required libraries as part of the image. Your pipeline code should not be responsible for managing its environment. You very much can put the code directly in the image and it is perfectly acceptable to do so. You'll just be building images extremely frequently and be storing a lot of them. If you are using cloud storage or Vms to build the costs add up at scale. At the very least though make sure you have an image per pipeline. You don't want to fall into the trap of needing to test every pipeline if you want to upgrade your image in any way. How you accomplish this can vary. Are you running on bare metal, k8s, some kind of runner? For example running in k8s using airflow as a scheduler kick off jobs from a yaml file. The yaml includes image tag, version, command to execute, some inputs or outputs depending on the pipeline. Git-sync container runs as an init container to grab the code and your image executes the desired pipeline. This makes the development cycle short and keeps testing easy. Need to run an old version, provide a tag or a sha to git sync to reference from instead of HEAD.",

You’re nervous and you get stuck in your head on what you prepared for, not what’s actually happening. The way I have dealt with this is to make notes about these types of situations and think through how I would have liked to handle it differently next time. I actually review this list of past flubs every time I interview and my own mistakes have made me better over time. In this case obviously it might have been better for you to be able to just take a step back and see you had simple problems in front of you. Or, if you felt uncertain, to say “I see a simple solution to this question or I could offer a more sophisticated approach, do you have a preference for how I tackle it?” But the point is no one answer is going to help you here because the next round of interviews the opposite situation could arise.

This can help get out of your own head while giving you both an idea of what it could be like to work together. They will want to hear you think through what are possible solutions and the pros and cons of each. This will give them a good sense of how you collaborate and simultaneously help you understand what they might be looking for from a potentially ambiguous problem. I personally get buried in my work and know it can be hard to come up for air and get some feedback.",

We take on the work and the risk along with the pay cut, while users expect uptime, features, and support, for free.This isn’t a side project. It’s a full-time job and then some. One that costs attention, energy, and sometimes relationships or families. You do it because you believe in a specific future, and that vision doesn’t always match the one a VC brings to the table. They invest for their outcomes. You build for yours. Somewhere in the middle, you still need to support a community that values freedom, build a product reliable enough to depend on, and fund a team that can keep showing up, all of that while staying sane, healthy etc.It’s a balancing act, between OSS principles, paid offerings, and personal sustainability. Most projects fail at it. We’re trying not to. It’s imperfect, but it’s our best effort.Before you throw stones, look closer. Founders are people, with goals, trade-offs, and things they’d rather not do but still show up for. Nobody wants to be the villain.I’m a data engineer like you. I worked my way up from the bottom.

Take it all in and go slow at first to learn who is who and what makes their world tick/important to them to ensure successful outcomes. Youll also get a great understanding of what skills you need to upgrade or learn from scratch as you may be hitting multiple areas of IT functions (Sysadmin, cloud admin, dba, devops and data engineering).It has definitely at times been overwhelming but take solace in the fact youre learning and becoming an one man army. Id recommend taking it with your 3 YoE as youll grow fast in your career and learn many skills other companies might already have other teams for.Best of luck if you take this step!

Later on you should be sanity checking designs and suggesting improvements. Figure out when it's valuable to push for a change vs letting it be.

I currently have \"copied\" the tables from our products as the lowest layer in our DWH and am then connecting them to several \"datamart\" tables that get used for dashboard/analytics, and in the future ML.

        "body": "IMO the data architecture depends more on the complexity of your organization and required analytics than on the data volume. In our case we had gradually accumulated 1500+ DBT models that were split into 3 layers and multiple streams. That was mostly because we had a self service setup where other teams were able to set up their own DBT models.I think the best thing to do when you design your warehouse is to agree on the common business vocabulary. You would be surprised to hear the number of times when different teams disagreed on the definition of a subscription or what a logged in user is. After you have the definitions locked down you can set up a classic 3 layer structure: raw, cleaned/merged and marts. Depending on your situation you might not need the middle layer, but i found that it helps to standardise the data and denormalise it where necessary.",

I don't think I would have broken in without a niche, very competitive market.Building a copied project isn't going to get you a job, but maybe an app with actual users.You really have to sell yourself if you're going to break in with no internships or prior experience, otherwise I would go back to school like OMSCS or UT Austin online and focus on getting an internship.",

Yes this is basically misleading but if you're able to speak intelligently to basic cloud services during the interviews and are able to pick things up quickly it likely doesn't matter. Option 2: read up on and test out as many DE related cloud technologies as you can so you can upfront say \"I haven't worked in cloud but have done personal projects and understand the technologies listed in the job description fit, and I'm confident I can contribute meaningfully in a month or less in those technologies if you hire me.\" I went this route in my onprem to cloud role transition. Regardless of the option, remember that hiring managers aren't looking for xyz skills per se, they're wanting to know if you can do the job. You're not gonna convince every single one that you can do it without prior work experience but for those you can, full confidence goes a long way.",

        "body": "My vote would be to keep it all in MSSQL but that’s because I’m an MSSQL DBA. Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!Having an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). But also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. I haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.To expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.It reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).So there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.My patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!So yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt. Just in case it’s a better fit for you.",

But then I started to remember the positives, About what I can deliver as a Lead and how am I really competent. Tried to reflect that in my resume. Imagine being out of work and then applying, that would be even more stressful, so I counted that as a plus too. At work I was just managing and making sure that nobody knew about my job hunt, made sure I was doing just enough. I targeted roles at specific companies and even reached out to recruiters directly, saying in a few lines how well I can fit into the role. By some miracle I got two calls. I was able to convert one. Didn’t have to lower my comp from the current too, however, I did lower my expectations a bit after a while. It was tough and looking back the journey was hard, stressful and brutal.

My organisation decided against a delta lake in favor of a easier to maintain (allegedly) Snowflake warehouse. The consultants sold them on the idea, so it must be true.",

Then comes Airflow which they were using for scheduling and Orchestration. Learned the specific operators which were used in that project itself and some bare minimum basic infra things.The project was of Data Migration of Data Warehouse from on prem Teradata to GCP Big Query. So learned a bit Biq Query as well.Now coming to your question when I went out again for Interviews every one was expecting Spark as a must so learned that too from a guy call Manish on youtube.This process helped me get 4 offers after working for 2.5 years in that company. In short all you need to do is study the above tech stack and tell the interviewer that you have worked on xyz project on DE. With less thn 3 years of Exp they wont be expecting too muchAnd the most important thing of all do some hard core Sql as part of preperation. 4 5 months is the correct estimation.

I know Salesforce in particular rate limits their APIs which can make it difficult to export large amounts of data (they don’t want you doing this, essentially) so that could be the reason. A properly designed & implemented CDC system shouldn’t have “data quality” issues like those that you’ve mentioned. But could it be that deletes are handled a different way? For example, if SCD type 2 is implemented in Snowflake, you’d never delete records entirely, you’d instead end-date them and insert a new row. Hope that helps!",

Its usually given to folks with some DE experience.As a DE Intern, I have always asked for more work, wanted to learn and get my hands dirty. Here are some things I wish the company could have done / Internships in DE should be like1. Rotation: I feel DE is broad, you have members handling your K8s, Analytics Engineers, EDH teams etc... I think the internship should offer the candidates a feel of each role. This way I feel, they will get more insights about the entire flow on a prod level. Like how teams are handling the companies data needs etc..2. Reward : You will always find someone who shows more interest and passion towards DE than the others, reward them, meaning, additional responsibilities like leading a group of interns to build end-to-end pipelines, let them figure out.3. Coupons for Professional certifications as a reward (maybe?)",

The entire experience was so overwhelming and almost everything I learned was about conflict& expectations management rather than DE, I think interns should be given clear instructions and not be included in internal drama.On a side note will your program be open to accepting interns remotely ? I'm looking for an experience in DE this summer and I would love to hear from you.",

        "body": "Thank you for your reply! At my company we have different internship programs for undergrad and grad students, I work only with the undergrad program. We don’t have a specific rotation plan. Since we’re a consulting firm people tend to naturally rotate projects, and interns follow that once they convert into full time employees (usually happens after around 1 year of internship — in my country internship contracts can last up to 2 years, and at my company we aim to convert interns into FTEs, we don’t hire juniors, they come exclusively from the internship program). The way our program is structured is around 6 months for the learning plan (since they are undergrad students we don’t expect/require previous experience or extensive knowledge) and the remaining internship period (this can change from intern to intern based on their needs/progress) is spent allocated on project (usually the same one).We don’t have any official rewards system, but as a team our approach it to give the interns opportunities to explore according to their development and interests. Things like interns joining POCs, internal projects, etc. We have a dedicated budget for the internship programs, so any courses/certifications they take are covered by that and we provide access to the O’Reily learning portal. These are not rewards though, they are part of the internship program.",

If you have to get \"everything\" our solution (though architecture and tooling is different specifically not using redshift) was delta loads for ingestion -> incremental persistent table (dbt model) (we use a variant column (snowflake) to persist a historical record of the raw data still in its semi structured format) -> then we flatten the arrays into operational tables (e.g. event params or user events) which are also incremental models (we generate a custom unique key here based on array data) ( in snowflake we cluster based on the keys that make up the operational key to improve efficiency) and we use the delete+merge snowflake strategy (this is well documented and can be replicated in other tooling, snowflake just makes it easier and cans the feature OOB).Most of our compute is snowflake for these cases and for a persistent historical BQ object of ~10b rows (semi-structured), in terms of dbt, we can run most of our models in 5-30 mins (each) depending on the array size and if we scale the Snowflake WH.Obviously if your GA4 has a bit more customization, and your traffic is significantly larger than my end users, your experience can differ but we feel this is a solid and scalable approach. A bigger risk point is if the delete+merge strategy fails during the run you could see data loss, but that's fairly unlikely and also why we have a redundant backup.",

If something is working, just fine even if it's nonstandard or antiquated, it may not be worth updating.From what you've said, here are my thoughts:>So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised?How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus. If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.>Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.>Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity. Some have the mindset that it's \"cheaper\" to avoid vendors and have engineers build everything in-house; in my experience, that math only works if you discount labor costs at 100%. You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB: [https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html) This goes against my advice to do things in-house (although MotherDuck may offer this in a managed solution soon), but if you're not processing multi-TB datasets, DuckDB is very attractive in terms of pricing vs. traditional distributed warehouses.Good luck!",

So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.The second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.So, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.Main 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.Additional sources are:External API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.Series of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.MailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast.

Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.Got it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.Generally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.Lmao, me neither.

You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.This is something I've realised / been realising. Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.I'll take a look at those names. Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty.

The data is by-and-large all kept within a Dataverse / D365 instance, although some bits of data are kept external and instead pulled directly into a PBI report.It's a solution that's been built over the course of a fair few years.The end goal would be either finding a new central data store or improving how we use Dataverse as one, and making sure everything is accessible within it.Dataverse / D365 we use generally as a standard CRM. The website contains much of the same information, on top of some additional website specific data: the actual quote requests raised and reported spend being the main pieces.We had originally used a vendor to move from a Dynamics 2014 system to 365 back in around 2020 and the requirement was to make the synchronisation between the new CRM and the website realtime as they shared a lot of data. From what I know, that requirement is intended to stay for the time being.Hopefully, depending on however the solution we end up with shakes up that requirement might change. But generally if say an Account (eg one of our members) has some of their details changed on say the CRM then that change needs to be propagated to the website on-demand rather than on-schedule.I am aware that's a rather big ask. Performing that sync on a scheduled basis with a more meaningful separation between our CRM and web data would probably work better.",

Testing in ADF costs you money. \\* You can develop SSIS solutions on your notebook without any network connectivity in a designer that is a desktop application. ADF designer requires network connectivity and it becomes clunky once you start to create more complex solutions. \\* In SSIS you have a choice of many third-party extensions to use when developing solutions. In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features. Some people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing. I suspect many people are now discovering that having the ability to run SSIS both on-premises and in the cloud is a very attractive feature compared to having a solution that is cloud-only with no ability to transition back on-premises for cost reasons, for example.",

I can see I might not have the most popular opinion, but their connect product is very good and can alleviate the maintenance overhead of writing and deploying multiple pipelines especially when needing to handle fan out.A nice common workflow if you are trying to POC an eventing hook is to use a sink connector for http request, very much a tool box.",

The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",

For a pure notebook feel with SQL superpowers, try DataStation or Querybook (from Pinterest).

        "body": "I'd vote for [Malbolge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge), if we're counting esoteric languages. The language was designed with the express purpose of being as difficult to use as possible, going as far as requiring the source code itself to be encoded in a cypher, making it essentially impossible to read. Beyond that, it uses base 3 arithmetic, and essentially requires to use of self modifying code to accomplish most tasks.There are very few programs written in it, with the first hello world program appearing 2 years after the language was published. And that code was not written by hand, but instead generated using a [beam search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) algorithm.If we relax the \"uselessness\" requirements a bit, and focus more on languages that are simply incredibly different from the ones you've learned, there are a lot of potential candidates.[Prolog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a logic programming language where you basically describe the problem and the compiler finds a program that solves it (assuming it has a solution). This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.Similarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this: life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}This example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.You could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.There are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.While I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's \"useful\", I think putting emphasis on the \"uselessness\" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider \"how different is this language from what I'm familiar with\", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.Edit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",

Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good. Easy to write, readable, produces efficient apps, easy to deploy, if you don't mind its paradigm and wordiness, you'll generally enjoy using it.",

        "body": "Go has several things going for it:1. It's a small, simple language that can do a LOT. No endless boilerplate, no forced OOP paradigm. It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.6. Edit: I forgot a big one! Go's concurrency model is easy to use and easy to reason about. I have found so many uses for it.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal. However, that comes at a cost, so when you have to venture into things like runtime checks or the `unsafe` package, you get into a deep rabbit hole quickly. For example, working with a large volume of JSON data gets really tricky if you need it fast.",

        "body": "Go is new, simple and fast, and so anaemic on features, the built-in json parsing lib needs to have a special syntax just to make parsing json somewhat bearable.It's an incredibly nanny-ish language that refuses to compile \"for your own good\", as it demands production level code quality even in the exploratory phase of programming.It's a \"simple\" language with a shrodinger's null, which either does or doesn't equal itself based on the implementation details of the particular type of the variable you're storing the null in.It's got a very simple and effective error handling that's easy to learn, ugly and 100% relying on the programmer's vigilance.A forgotten error check = no error. I don't mean runtime error, this isn't like exceptions that propagate. I mean **no error**. The call seems successful, except you get nulls as a result. Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == \"\", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be \"clean\", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \\* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \\* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \\*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use \"interfaces\" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",

Time to learn! Learning what you need to make the project will be your project!Break it down into smaller and smaller tasks until each task is small enough to be accomplished in less than a day or two. Create an ordered list of those tasks and tackle them one at a time. Stack up those small victories. Create momentum and ride it. Stuck on something and feel your momentum slowing? Switch tasks or call for help. Momentum is king and it's fed directly by those small victories. Small victories eventually add up to bigger ones. Those bigger ones eventually add up to a completed project. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You have to pace yourself.Once the project is done, do an analysis of what went right and what went wrong. Learn from your mistakes and keep doing what works.Bask in your victory for a short time. Treat yourself, you earned it.Pick your next project and buckle up. It's time to ride that train again.The longer you go, the easier it usually gets. If you find things are getting harder instead of easier, take a moment to step back and see why things are getting harder and how to lower the difficulty. If you find the difficulty of the project has gone past your limits, it might be time to realize your limits and find a more manageable project. Maybe, you got too ambitious and need to pick something easier, for now. Maybe, what you picked just isn't realistic to begin with. Sometimes, you have to figure these things out the hard way. It's a learning process and, if you do it right, it never ends and you don't want it to end.As for tools, you're pretty much the only person who knows what kind of tools you need.When it comes to programming, the tools you're likely to need are mostly in two categories. There are the tools that directly impact programming and the ones for organization and tracking progress.For programming, it's mostly about the environment; the editor, plugins and related tools. These are usually fairly straight forward to understand. Though, finding your preferences is a bit of a trial and error experience. Most people are fairly happy with Visual Studio Code for the editor. Try that and see what you like or don't like about it. If you're happy, move on to figuring out what additional plugins and tools make it work best for you. If not, figure out what you like and don't like about it and see if there's something that better fits your preferences or if there are plugins that fix what you don't like.For organization and tracking progress, it becomes even more personal. Maybe, you do it all in a series of post-it notes. Maybe, you type it out in a bunch of plain text documents. Maybe, you use something more sophisticated. You're the only one who knows what work flow works for you. There's more organizational and tracking tools out there than I could list in the 10000 character count limit. Do some digging and find your favorites. I'm a minimalist, so I mostly use Notepad and the occasional spreadsheet, as an example.I feel like, in the world of programming especially, searching for perfect answers is the biggest of all follies. You don't need a perfect answer, just one that isn't wrong. It's fine to occasionally take a moment to see if better answers exist but don't get obsessed.",

If you're personally satisfied, that's enough. While such partial understanding isn't acceptable in practical work, it's precisely because it's private that it's allowed.

Most Python courses are pretty intro. You could try CS50x which is in C, but do all the programming projects in Python instead. The programming projects (called *problem sets*) are more advanced than most beginning programming courses in the US because it's Harvard.If you do go to the bootcamp route, do some research to make sure it's legitimate. Apparently, a lot of it is kinda bad. There is CS50w which is web programming with Python and Javascript.

Do this at least 6 months to a year, and then start prepping for \"real interviews\" learn your algorithms, do leetcode, etc. You'll never be ready but as long as you have ok understanding of data structures and most common algorithms on those structures you'll be good. Don't forget to also study software/systems design/architecture.Then, start applying to companies where you'd like to work or ones where the work has meaning to you, otherwise you'll suffer. Don't believe the promises startup will make and if you're either bored or tired of a low pay then jump ship to a bigger company, this time \"the bigger the better\" you want this second company to be crazy big, avoid big companies whose main focus isn't technology, i.e. prefer Uber instead of Lenovo, streaming at Disney rather than IT at Boeing. There you'll learn about big scale and other engineering practices, this is where you go from midlevel engineer to senior, but to enter these companies sell yourself as a senior. Again be proactive, don't limit yourself to be a developer, you should also do the deployments, monitoring, become a generalist that goes deep. At least 3 years in a company like this will do. Don't fall in to the politics governing these big companies, you're there to learn, let them play their little games.After that the world is your oyster, you should be looking for companies that are surfing a generational wave, for example nowadays looking at Anthropic or OpenAI would be good, every ~10 years or so there's a big trend you should follow, personally I've found my sweetspot is remote companies of around 100 people, maybe 50 engineers, not everything depends on you but you still have impact on the future direction, no politics and no drama. Aim to at least double the pay every-time you switch companies, and during interviews never reveal what did you get paid at the previous job, at some point it would be almost impossible but if you're good you might get lucky.Good luck!...or enroll in a bootcamp.",

It’s widely used for both frontend and backend development, including frameworks like React and runtime environments like Node.js. You can learn both sides pretty quickly by following large full-project tutorials on YouTube. Stick with one, and whenever you’re curious about something, dive into the documentation or use GPT for deeper understanding. You’ll learn the most by building projects, it’s fun, gives you real-world experience, and helps you start building a portfolio. Check out the FreeCodeCamp website it offers a great roadmap and exercises to learn full-stack development. You don’t need six months.

Within a program and interacting from program to program was very much not that easy. Even now, having understood and used more abstract concepts like multiple inheritance, the diamond problem, writing with and without OOP, and functional programming. Breaking down a task and putting it into code is still not easy for me. It really just takes time for the specific use case, it'll take a few iterations of design, or a completely new design in the end. It'll never be perfect, there is no perfect, but there's good enough, and good enough works until there's another good enough to compare it to. This is especially true when writing a one-off program, you don't know how much time invested into each component is worth, so those programming design patterns are now weighed with your desire to get something to work. Deadlines make everything a mess. The thing that helps is practice. Practice a lot. Practice is the best way to learn once you know how to write. There's always something new to learn so that can also feel depressing, you'll get to a point though like where I'm at that not knowing something won't bother you, because you know you can learn how to use it quickly, or you can also invest a couple hours understanding it completely. Most problems can be understood completely, don't try to look at the LZMA2 source code or code that is all sprawled out and think it'll be understood fast or completely.I've been doing this for a decade or so but my projects still seem amateur or chaotic, this is actually quite normal outside of a serious investment of time. Embrace chaos for the most part. I'm not going to report you to the FBI for having everything in a single file or reimplementing functionality, as long as you could do the opposite when you need to.",

I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.I’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.I tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.There are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.My first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.I’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.So I’m saying this: If you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it. You have to grind. Not for weeks. Not for months. **For years.**Are you willing to do that? Shiii I was diong this homeless. But yea have to put in the work because if you don't even the people who would like to help you wont because your not helping yourslef. Networking is good as a dev because you can work on projects with devs , you can work on projects with ui/ux designers etc . They'll reach out after if they don't its fine. Even if you network with busienss people you can get work though them . Sometimes it not about being good its about communicating and getting the job done because poeple don't understand what they are looking at in terms of code they look at results . So asking for permission....",

That isn't to say that you can't do it, but the market is far more competitive than people outside of tech realise. Setting up a small website sounds incredibly complicated to someone with no programming skills, but it's a fairly entry level task to a hobbyist. Practically any professional can do that.You'll need to expand your projects, look at proper certification, learn how that software is built, packaged and deployed, how all of the above can be automated, and learn how to implement different design patterns and technologies, and when to use each of them.It's all doable, but it's a lot more work than setting up a few websites.",

I'm not saying that these aren't good places to start, they really are, but they need to be used as the baseline for a least a year of extra learning or hardcore personal portfolio creation.Not to be harsh here, but you got advertised to by Udemy and they gave you expectations that were way too high. I think next steps to get a job are A: go to some form of higher education. B: work your ass off doing personal projects.That being said, this market is extremely saturated at the moment and if you got sold comp-sci solely as an easy industry to get into, maybe think hard about if you really enjoy doing it. Im currently a hot-property azure dev, and the absolute nightmare it is to find jobs (in the UK) for people with 5-10 years' experience tells me that the junior market is way worse than it was 5 years ago, its not impossible, but its hard and unless you are some savant-level coder (I'm definitely not one of those) its mostly luck based.",

Even then, you have to stand out to make it past the resume filter stage. Think about it this way: if there are 1000 applications, half get filtered by degree, leaving 500 apps, which is still too many for a human to reasonably read through in a timely fashion. Filtered by specific experience, results will vary, but if you add a specific cert like AWS Developer, and now you have something much more manageable.

I'm saying that because you sound like you are focusing on the tools and missing the bigger purpose as well as all the tasks needed before even starting creating a new source file. You and your team identify what the software needs then you build, select and piece together all the components, and sometimes you will be programming some logic or patterns here and there.I understand that you panicked and did something permanent in a temporary situation, but you could have believed that you had enough tools to assist you so that when it wasn't the time to code you should have focused on the rest of the software development lifecycle - a lot of which is about everyone preparing, reading and understanding their assignments.",

The problem with a manager class is that it quickly gets difficult to read and debug.Something you can do is have a sort of manager class/service that does perform a lot of the related functions but you have each of those functions broken out into their own separate modules that the manager class methods call. This pattern helps with testing and mocking, helps with readability, and is overall much easier to maintain.",

I either already have other patterns that centralize the logic, or I’m using a service layer to handle more complex operations. That said, I’ve found the Manager pattern can be useful in specific cases, particularly when I’m dealing with tightly coupled dependencies that I want to decouple. For example, in one of our applications, we had settings that were unfortunately intertwined with other parts of the application, like the data layer. Introducing a manager to hide those implementation details behind an abstraction allowed me to control those dependencies more easily, making it simpler to swap or adapt implementations later on.",

Your question is a \"devil's in the details\" kind of question, and it's hard to make a sweeping good or bad generalization of any and all manager classes. But if you want to approach it from the Stroustrup style, then I'd say: \\* Check that your class fields are maintaining an invariant. If they're not, then maybe this class should be a struct with plain functions. \\* Check that every method plays a role in maintaining the invariant. If one doesn't, then move it out of the class. \\* Check that every method is valid to use right after the constructor finishes. Does it make sense to invoke unload if I don't invoke load? If some method still needs more setup, then it should have its own constructor (and thus own class).Still, as always, the devil's in the details. If you can share maybe simplified example code, then we can get into the nitty-gritty.",

I've seen plenty of cases where the manager class has nothing to do with object lifecycle management. For this reason, if you read code and you encounter a manager class it tells you nothing about what it's doing. That's not only bad for understanding the code but also because these classes tend to attract more and more code because every logic fits into a manager class. It's the same issue with \"utils\" or \"common\" folders or files. They accumulate all the code people don't know or don't care to name or place properly. It just builds technical debt over time.The solution is not always to split the class into several smaller ones, often times it's enough to just pick a more meaningful name.",

Things like variables, loops, if statements, functions, classes may be syntactically different from language to language but functionally they’re the same. So once you learn the when and why to use these things, that knowledge is language agnostic. For cybersecurity I will say starting with something a little lower level like C, might not be an awful idea, but it will be more difficult as there’s more boilerplate code. My friend who just started online classes for cybersecurity was started on Java. So maybe start there. Point though is just pick one and start. Period.",

You'd check for compile errors, then fix the compile errors, assuming it was identifying the correct line. Sometimes the error occurred much earlier than the line that caused the problem.Once you got the code to compile, you'd run the code, test it, see if it did what you wanted to do, and repeat until it worked.The worst errors were accidentally deleting your code and starting from scratch, but errors similar to this where you misspelled something were super common. It taught programmers to read and re-read their code because the edit-compile-test cycle was so slow.Nowadays, a good IDE points out errors as you edit.One possibility is to run the code through an LLM, have it identify all the variable names and list it in alphabetical order. Anything that looks off would hopefully show up quickly.",

(think SOLID principles)look into architecture patterns (MVC for example is super simple) and start conforming your uml diagram to it, although I'll be honest none of the code on the stuff I work on in production has diagrams or adheres to a pattern lol so remember be realistic when doing this, you want a very brief high level overview that is able to change as needed. Maintaining diagrams can be a full time job, but it's ultimately one way you could start. Remember there is no best way, this is just one way of doing things.Edit : regarding how to learn I'd ask AI how to conform code to a pattern, how to start with high level system architecture. Maybe from an academic standpoint it wouldn't hurt to build a very thorough UML diagram, AI can help with that. Then move on to something more than practical.",

And with 10% probability pay for your daily coffee. Of course, using AI on any stage is great idea but so far, the most important part, integration, is still manual.",

Private tool servers, private agents, refactoring and tightening up RBAC on APIs to accommodate more dynamic access patterns... those are things that there won't be one vendor for.

Every shop will be building AI apps and especially extending and refactoring their existing systems to leverage AI, and the primary skill set will be building, not working at the bleeding edge of technology, but developing applications for it. UX is about to go through a bigger revolution than the smart phone. This change is going to make backends be designed differently. And platforms. There's about to be a ton of dev work, even with our shiny new tools that let us build feature X much faster than we could build it 5 years ago. We'll find ways to leverage lower experienced contributors, it just won't be endless frontend feature factories; demand for said features will go down with AI powered UX (not bolted on chat bot bs), and where they are needed, AI slop can handle that.

Same for index\\_of, also O(n) time.So, completely disregarding the correctness, you have three calls to O(n) functions in your simpler approach, making the overall runtime far worse for large inputs. (EDIT for clarity: The inside of the loop changes from O(1) to O(n), so the entire algorithm changes from O(n) to O(n²), because of the outer loop)If you want to see it for yourself, choose a large integer (like 10\\_000\\_000) as your target, and only fill the array with random integers of less than half it's size. This way, your condition will never trigger, and you will need to go through the entire array. Now make the array of length 100 million, and watch the runtime difference.(This strongly depends on a good hash map / hash function for the values. This depends on your language. Make sure that the hash map works correctly, because if it doesn't it might also have O(n) runtime and you will not see a big difference XD)",

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust. Unless you're aiming for sub-ms optimizations, and have a problem that is uniquely suited, hashmaps are pretty much always going to be faster.",

        "body": "The devs who create APIs are backend devs, and they typically work in languages like Java, Python, C#, and even JavaScript. They often use special frameworks for these languages that have built-in features that make building APIs easier or more performative. Typically they also work with databases in some capacity, as a core function of most APIs is retrieving or saving data to a database.Typically the devs consuming APIs are frontend devs who need data to display on a GUI. However, APIs can also call other APIs, so consuming APIs is something done by devs front or backend. It's becoming more common to become a full stack developer where you both create APIs and then consume them on the frontend. Often times though even full stack devs will specialize in one over the other. You'll find when you do this kind of work, you don't need to be a master of a language or framework to create passable features. Obviously it depends, but if your API consists of a lot of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) work, most devs can produce these endpoints with not a ton of experience needed.A great tool to start messing around with APIs is postman. You can call API endpoints from this tool and see exactly what type of data they return. Then you can start imagining how you could use this data, or how to build your own API that produces data you need. A real life example I'm currently working with is that I'm creating an app that uses flood data. Weather.gov has a great API that allows me to get flash flood alerts. Instead of just calling this flash flood API from my frontend, I'm actually calling the weather API from my backend. I'm doing this because I need to alter the data to fit my needs before using it. So I'm using my API to grab data with weather.gov's API, manipulating that data into a usable form for myself, storing that data in my own database, and then calling my own API from my own frontend to get that data out of my database so I can display flood alerts to users in the way that I need. Hopefully that helps!",

        "body": "One good way to think about APIs is a way to connect 30+ different services, instead of having a single service that tries to do it all. You need a way for service 1 to talk to service 3. This is done through APIs. Here is a long winded example:Imagine you have one central platform that users interface with (the UI/website).But then you also have three services {A1-3} that take in data at the start, from three different sources. Say the data coming into A1-3 is different user activity, say everytime a user logs into some systems {S1-3}. Those systems send data in different ways to A1-3. A1-3 may transform the data in some way and send it down the pipeline. Possibly convert it into some central schema, since the three sources {S1-3} provide different sources data formats.Maybe one of these data-consumers {A2} needs to query some other service {B1} that provides additional user data. Perhaps A1 and A3 already get this additional data directly from their sources, S1 and S3. B1 is a service your company created that just stores a bunch of specific data in a database. When the service A2 queries it (or any other service), it returns some useful information. Maybe the database holds user host information (like their computer name). So B1 is an API that takes in a User ID, and returns their hostname/Mac address/location, ect. It just queries the database by user ID, and returns the information. So you might say, why not just have A2 query the database directly? Well, what if later on you have another service that wants the same data. So you made the API B1, which is the only connection point to this particular database. Once A1-3 enrich and convert their data into a central schema, they send that data using some messaging service (e.g. Kafka) to one consumer, C1. C1's job is to just store this data in some database. All it does is read data from A1-3 and store it (in a DB), and then it provides an API to retrieve this data on-demand. All of these could be called 'microservices'. Instead of having a single service that does it all, we have 6 that just handle their own little section. The user interface (the front end), needs to be able to provide information to customers. If the customer needs to know when User#45 last logged in, it queries C1. This event has the original data A2 consumed + some enrichment from B1. Now is the best part. Remember how we made B1 its own independent service? When the UI wants to give the latest login info about a user it query C1.But what about when it needs to provide just hostname information (which is not directly tied to a particular login instance). These hostnames are unrelated to the login information from C1 (even though C1 has some hostname info, but only when related to logins).So now the UI can query B1 to provide a bunch of hostname information. In this long example, we only have two APIs, B1 and C1. But whilst populates B1? Imagine we also need to manage payment information, basic account info, ect. If it's closely related, it could be with one API and in one database. But often there will be disparate data from different sources. Better to make everything modular. So you end up with a bunch of small services that make their data available through their individual APIs.",

That's an API. So the answer to your question is both. I both take advantage of libraries that others have written and expose an API for consumption, and deliver libraries that are used by others. This goes for REST as well -- if you work with microservices, it's very common for the individual services to all communicate via REST APIs. Each service exposes its capabilities via REST verbs and endpoints, and in turn consumes other REST endpoints. Of course, certain services may use a message broker or queuing mechanism for communication, but REST is still very common when reliable message delivery and multiple message consumers aren't important.",

Rust will do this by failing to compile and telling you why.For a beginner, I'd think that the Rust approach is more useful, because the compiler is helping you understand the lifetimes of variables, and where you might be trying to hold references to them beyond their existence.Rust also has some nice features that makes it a bit more expressive. Plus it deals with Unicode for you.Having said that, you will be fighting the Rust compiler to begin with as you learn Rust's rules.

Both languages are technically high-level languages, but they can be used for low-level system programming.Whatever language you start with, you'll need to learn systems programming. The language is a fairly small part of that.You'll be learning the different parts of the os, what subsystems/interfaces/APIs are available and where/how to access them. At an even lower level you be accessing hardware directly and learning how whole systems are architected on-chip, accessed through registers and fifos, and how all those are connected on various busses. Plus concepts like multithreading, mutexes, semaphores, spin-locks, memory barriers, irq contexts... I could go on.IMO, the only thing you'll miss by not learning C first is the why. Rust can teach you the how, the concepts, the best practices, etc, just fine. But you might not understand why rust does what it does, which you can pick up later.However... If you want to learn systems programming, you will have a lot more examples, explanations, and tutorials in C.So while I was initially leaning towards rust if that's what you want to use, I would really consider at least learning to comfortably navigate and understand C if you are new to systems programming and want to focus on that.",

Do you want to build whizzy gadgets using microcontrollers? Get involved in designing new chips? Layout circuit boards for computers? Are you interested in RF engineering?You can start doing some of that stuff in the comfort of your own workshop while still earning a decent living as a software developer. Invest a few hundred bucks in basic tools like a good multimeter, soldering iron, etc., and few microcontroller boards such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico, and some simple components like switches, wire, resistors, etc. There are all sorts of fun projects that you can build with the most basic electronics knowledge. Modern microcontrollers are very easy to use and a ton of fun. This is probably the hardware equivalent of getting started in programming with an easy language like Python.Becoming a professional \"hardware engineer\" obviously involves a lot more than that. Go look up the degree requirements for a bachelors degree in electrical engineering at your favorite university to get a taste of what you don't know.Probably your best bet would be to find a software development role that's hardware-adjacent. You could start building microcontroller projects in your spare time to start learning about embedded programming, and once you feel up to speed on that start looking for programming roles on hardware development projects.",

You get paid the same regardless, and almost ALL employers expect 10 hour days at least some of the time, often as much as half or more of the time. That gets old. I learned to game that system when it was a problem, but even so, managers often can't understand that it can take a full day or more to fix one line of code for a nasty bug.. I got reamed out last job because the idiot I inherited a feature from had designed his class so that it would do completely different things depending on whether you had () or not, but both resulted in a value that C++ could take as a true/false ... finding the extra () on one call in one place and understanding that it was wrong took several days and to management, that was too long to spend on it. Same place, they asked me to draw a straight line around a sphere --- there is nothing you can do when you have bad management full of dumb, but even when you know you are right and they are not, its high stress. I would put the stress factor of all my jobs on average at least in the 7 out of 10 level, with 10 being a trauma surgeon or something and 1 being the guy that watches TV while he monitors home alarm systems and makes one phone call every couple of hours if one gets set off.",

This is called a foreign function interface. You see it most often with C because C is so old and has a well defined, unchanging way that functions are compiled.And the third way is the one you know- send bytes to another program in a defined format like json or xml and deserialize it on the other side. If you want to make it easy to define the types and methods in multiple languages at once, you can use an interface definition language like Google's protocol buffers, which can then be used to generate functions and type definitions in a number of supported programming languages.",

To contrast this, lower level systems often have ABIs (application binary interfaces). An ABI doesn't have friction calls so much as \"put a value in this address in memory and/or jump to this memory address\". Anything where the thing you're calling is defined in source code terms is an API. A really common example of two languages talking to eachother is Python and C. Python is very easy to use but not very fast, so many of the performance-focused libraries like NumPy have the number crunching written in C and the python code calls the C code. There's a guide on that here https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/Another example: every single web browser that supports web assembly (WASM) does this; certain things can't be done in WASM so you need to be able to run JavaScript from your WASM code. The browsers provide an API for this. If you want to communicate between two different running programs there are a variety of message passing methods out here.",

The reason you might want this is to improve security further, it means if an attacker chooses the password \"password123\" and they somehow get access to the encrypted passwords, they won't be able to know everyone else that used the same password (since they will have different encrypted passwords even though they had the same original password).Whenever you generate a password with a salt, you are supposed to store that salt and use it again when validating the password. If you don't store the salt, you CAN'T authenticate the password when the user tries to log in.Note that you can absolutely use unsalted encryption if you want, but it's less secure so it's not recommended.",

        "body": "Hey! Learning Python gives you a solid foundation, but web development usually means learning some extra stuff on top. For ex. with Python, you’d want to pick up a web framework like Django or Flask to build websites. Those frameworks handle things like routing, templates & databases which aren’t part of core Python itself.From my experience when I first started with Python I focused on the basics like syntax and data structures. But when I jumped into web dev, I had to learn how HTTP works, how to structure a web app, and how to connect to databases. If you want to build apps (like desktop or mobile), that’s another layer you’d learn different tools (like Kivy for desktop apps or something else for mobile). So yeah, the core language helps, but web dev and app dev have their own sets of skills you’ll want to pick up along the way. Keep going it’s all part of the fun!",

        "body": "This is something I recommend a lot: take a paper (or use notepad in the computer) and just imagine you're doing this thing manually. Step by step, what are the actions? Don't be abstract like \"calculate value\", but rather, be as specific as possible, like \"multiply cost with (1 + tax), then divide results by 100\".Do this for each step until you are able to manually, with no code at all, complete the process reliably, regardless of which values are used.Once you're done, copy all the steps as comments to your code. Translate manual actions to code. Using the above example, you'd do a line like `(cost * (1 + tax)) / 100`. Repeat until all steps are done, and that should work great.Writing code is the easy part, but when it's coupled with having to solve a problem, it becomes complex. When you do this, you're fully separating the problem solving and the code. Once you got the process done, you can then set up the code for each step.Edit: some time ago, I was working on a mod, and used this method a lot as I was learning how to get things running. You can still see the comments as I copied them from the notepad: https://github.com/Shushishtok/dota-reimagined/blob/7282a8a781496aeee4d3338750657fae93e24a14/game/scripts/vscripts/GameMode.ts#L304Of course, in a professional settings those comments are discouraged, but it's my hobby project so I didn't care about leaving those up.",

Then, develop a manual solution, as you, the person, would solve it. Note each step you take down. Be as detailed as possible. Refine the steps. Test the steps. Rinse and repeat.Then, once you have a detailed, step by step solution, work on the implementation in code. Ideally every single step would correspond to a single statement in code.Use bulleted lists, draw flow charts, use UML, whatever helps.Do not think about programming first. The code is the last, final part of programming, not the beginning. The problem analysis is the first step. Then, deriving an algorithmic step by step solution. Then testing the solution. Then, implementation in code.Also, practice, practice, practice, and practice more. That's the onyl way to improve.",

Code is infinity changeable as long as there isn’t much existing code that depends on its details.Let’s say you need to parse some data to objects and then process them. Rather than agonizing over class design and how the processing will happen, just go ahead and write the file parser. As a shitty first draft, it doesn’t even really need to return anything. It could just print the data to the console. Then you have all the details of the data right there in the code and can focus on thinking how to return it so that it’s convenient to use in the rest of the code.",

Person B, writes a failing test 4. Person A, writes the implementation that males the test pass 5. repeat until the solution is solvedYou can add as many people as you want.The thing here is that by doing it public, you are put under a certain amount of psychological pressure. I've known many good coders who placed in public suddenly choke and go cold. It's very different giving a speech to yourself in the mirror vs standing in front of a group of real people. Do this once a week. I guarantee you will get much better quickly! Not only that but you'll perform better later on when you're put on the spot in a job interview. Now, that being said - you could probably do this in a less stressful environment using AI as your person. There's probably some value in that but you won't get the stress response you really need. Best of luck!",

I really recommend doing an online Java course as it is a very good first language and will likely be used in your classes. Maybe take an online web-dev course as well. Also, use AI as a learning and exposure tool (by exposure I mean getting updated on what technical skills you should be learning). Read job descriptions and see what technical skills they are looking for, then do some prep with those technologies. Lastly, stay interested and have an open-minded and positive attitude, that's probably one of the most important things.",

It listens to those local Telegram groups, extracts location and context from messages, saves it to a database, and shows the results on an interactive map. Basically, you can load the map and see where people say TCC recruiters are. Like Pokémon Go, but very... Ukrainian :grinning_face_with_sweat:It works pretty well locally — but I haven’t shared it publicly, because there’s a risk I could be accused of “obstructing military operations,” which is a very sensitive topic here.Anyway, it’s not really real-time (no WebSockets or live updates yet), more like a snapshot when the page loads. I’d love to build something more light-hearted next, something fun and safe to share with others. Maybe even silly.Thanks again for the inspiration!",

Websites like Squarespace offering building kits in which you can make the global layout without coding and then refine things via. added scripts and libraries. 2. WordPress 3. HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe \"correct\" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.Easy-Mode: HTML + CSS Medium-Mode: add JavaScript Hard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databasesKind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team (I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",

Here’s a definition from a Japanese dictionary:節(せつ)を屈(くっ)・する の解説「節を折る」に同じ。「せつ【節】」の全ての意味を見るThis doesn’t help a beginner. To learn anything from this you already have know a bunch of Japanese.***Tutorials*** are guides for learning a tool. They’re a narrative, a kind of story that leads a learner along a path, teaching a little about each feature they present – usually just enough about the feature to achieve the next task.Tutorials don’t assume you know anything about the tool. They’re not useful for checking fine details about a specific thing, but they’re very useful for getting to know the basics.***How-tos*** are a sort of mini-tutorial for a specific area.

Find a *tutorial*. Not all tools have good tutorials, but if you search for “ beginner tutorial” you will find one.

You need to find the right kind of documentation for your particular needs and level of understanding (of the system and of programming). For instance, I can (now) read documentation on a language's specification (syntax and operational semantics) and mostly be able to start using it unless it's way outside the mainstream (like Idris or others where there are many more concepts learn to use them). For frameworks, I do better once I understand their underlying model but tutorial docs are where I start, then I visit the more detailed \"how it works under the hood\" documentation.Regardless of the kind of documentation, though, try to practice with the language, libraries, and frameworks as you go through the materials. When I learned C# for work way back when, I created a scratch solution with, eventually, dozens of projects. Each one had maybe 20-100 lines of code in them that exercised different parts of the C# language, C# libraries, or third party libraries I was trying to use. Whenever I found a new corner of the language I didn't know, I'd add a new one and practice.I do the same thing for exploring other concepts in CS, programming, networking, etc. Small throwaway projects that let me verify my understanding and, if it doesn't work, identify my gaps.",

However, try to start coding by yourself as early as possible because frameworks have a lot of features, and learning them can take a long time.Reading regular documentation is very hard for beginners because it is usually not structured well and just describes the functionality.Summary: if there is a good \"Getting Started\" guide — read it. If not, read other articles or watch YouTube videos there is nothing wrong here.P.S. In my opinion, LLMs are not very good for learning a new framework at the beginning, because frameworks are updated regularly, and LLMs may give outdated information.",

You identify the various components that you need, and then while you're going through the class list or API or whatever, you create a mind-map of all the classes/methods and what purpose they serve.If you're lucky, the documentation will provide some tutorials to demonstrate how to use the library so that at least you have something working.Ultimately, you should have some general understanding of what problem you're trying to solve, before jumping into a library.",

Python or NodeJS, or some other language. That basically opens a port and accepts HTTP connections. The usual data transfer format is JSON. Your API is basically the gateway and processing in front of the database. You send requests in some format, say the expressions the user enters, and the API takes your requests and writes them to the database.When your page loads, or some user-initated mechanism like a button, your web app will make a request to load the history from the database.Then you will need some function to manage the history, i.e. delete it.This of course is quite involved at your stage. A good thing about programming is that you can build simulations of what you need. Make an interface (a set of functions) for managing history in your web app. Then implement it as modifying some array in memory. Save it to localStorage if you want.Then later, when you are ready to jump into server-side programming, you can replace the functions with ones that call to your API instead.",

Your frontend can then make requests to the `/api/recent` URL using the browser's Fetch API (or any number of wrapper libraries around it).Writing an HTTP server in nothing but Node is doable but you have to deal with a bunch of low-level details yourself (e.g. URL parsing and routing).

AWS has a terrible dev experience and azure just feels like office software.I actually built a website to help people study for the AWS SAA certification exam ( [FireCert](https://firecloudcert.com) ) and built the entire thing with GCP because I hate AWS so much lol.",

Just a plain integer value of one.Now you have the multiplication of \"1\" and \"1.0\". One operahend is an integer and the other is a double precision floating point. Because they're different types, the integer will be converted into a double precision floating point. Then the two values will be multiplied together, getting the final result of 1.0.As for your second example of 1.0 * 3 / 2 = 1.5, you follow the same logic. First you have the multiplication of 1.0 * 3. The integer value of 3 is converted to the floating value of 3.0. The multiplication occurs, giving the floating result of 3.0. This is then divided by the integer value 2, but because the types don't match, the integer 2 is converted to the float 2.0, so you have 3.0/2.0 = 1.5.",

The only thing I would say that you would benefit from perpetually from a degree is learning the fundamentals as in my experience self taught engineers often skip a lot of these and struggle at certain points in their career when these fundamentals become more important (switching languages, architecture etc). Id also say that in my experience a lot of people doing ML / Machine learning that I encountered in the wild aren't actually people with Computer Science degrees they tend to be mathematicians. Two very different disciplines despite what people say (I'm awful at maths as I'm dyscalculic but really good at software development as it's more akin to algebra).",

But also, plenty of people write awful documentation. They've spent too much time thinking too deeply about the problem they're solving and they neglect to simplify it for the reader, and the documentation is at least as much about bragging about their accomplishments or geeking or about their model train as it is helping people. I admit I'm prone to that myself.Others abstract away too much information. It's really hard to feel like you understand something if you're understanding is full of \"trust me\" and \"just because\".If an AI can explain something so it makes sense to you, then the problem isn't you.

This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \\`class Router\\`* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* \"How to route incoming requests in Framework X\". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g. [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)* Tutorials: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth* to accomplish some real world task. This is what most blog articles and video how-tos are going to be. E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB\\_7aWwJMc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB_7aWwJMc)* Books: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth and depth* to accomplish some real world tasks. [https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/) Knowing which type of documentation best matches your current question and skill level is important!As tempting as it is to accelerate towards a single answer using AI for a work task, I would encourage any beginner in a topic to avoid doing this. Learning, and indeed authoring, code is considerably more than answering a question or completing a task. As you read API docs for one method, you stumble upon another that might better solve your problem. When researching \"how do I route with an optional parameter\" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a \"weird routing bug\" has an obvious and simple solution to you (\"this route just needs to be higher precedence\").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: \"Well, *it works\".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a \"well, it works\" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change. This can happen *incredibly* quickly.",

Normally you would learn faster and efficiently what you actually like.To learn, a lot of it is deliberate thinking through of processes, and a lot of internalization of concepts comes through prolonged exposure.When you say you have 'forgotten a lot', what do you mean? There is always a constant set of concepts that underlies a lot of programming paradigms. Have a good grasp over those. Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo. Learn as much, and be ready to learn when you have a job. What matter is the ability to learn. 4. If your parents are asking for you to get a job, prioritize good learning environment. Ideally with senior devs. Good mentorship is totally another level of learning. I assume you are still early in your career. 3. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything takes time. You seems to have a sense of urgency. It can be useful, but remember long term you want to grow as a more complete dev.",

I would still need to check documentation for tailwind, and css grids to get things properly, but the point was I knew what the approach would be.\\---One thing I will say. Your first project that you completely do on your own will be long and hard. But keep in mind that this difficulty and frustration is the actualy a sign and a process of becoming better.Tutorials are there to give you a direction. To get out of the tutorial hell - give this strategy a shot: 1. Stop watching tutorial (specially if you feel you have reached a saturation point in terms of 'knowledge of doing things') 2. Start making things on by yourself. 3. You will get stuck in basic things like tsconfigs, vite, setting up, integrating tailwind. This is fine. 4. When you do solve them, be mindful how you solved them, and take notes as to why it worked now and not before.It will be a bit slow, but a project driven learning is something I personally like.",

You're \"allowed\" to use API documentation and reference books and cheatsheets. The question is, are you just forgetting the exact call and parameters and syntax for connecting to the database? Because if that's all it is, even pros get this from time to time. Or, are you not understanding how any of it works? Because that's a much bigger problem, and is likely to be why you feel stuck.",

If I could do it over again, I would just go do a masters at somewhere like Georgia Tech, be done in 2 years, and who knows, maybe be working in the industry by now.Yes you can do projects and that will help some, and you should absolutely do that whether you go for the degree or not. But having a masters from a reputable university will help you get your foot in the door, clear hiring screens, etc. There are also plenty of affordable programs from highly-regarded public universities for you to choose from, so cost shouldn't be that big of a deterrent. The one caveat is that you do already have a STEM bachelors (which I don't have), so *maybe* you could pull it off if you leverage that plus some quality self-studying. But in this job market, I still think a masters is going to be your best bet.",

Haha.Right now I serve two senior devs in two different companies in the hope that they will help me survive this chaotic situation.It was my social skills that got me the job, not my programming skills. So my advice is not only learn the technical part, learn how to communicate with people and grow connection in real world (join local dev community, tech event, etc) even when you still in learning proccess, don't wait until you're 'good enough' because we'll never feel enough.Hope this will help.",

Can you write a hello world app right now without looking anything up? If not, that's a good first exercise. The goal is not to memorize how to do everything, but to just do a lot of simple things until it's conceptually super easy, then you can try something one step harder.For instance, if you told me to make a chat app right now, i could easily break it down into, ok, some kind of client with a UI, prompt for user input, then we have to send the input to the server, then, ok, the server has to be python or node or whatever, then we have to store all the chat sessions that come in, and propagate messages to the receiving end, then that client needs to process it and display it in the UI, and maybe cache some stuff or whatever. Then I could just go implement one little thing at a time and make sure it works as expected, and see if other little surprises crop up.But I can only do this because I spent so much time at one point just making trivial client and server, or just making a trivial web UI that does nothing, or just really basic data structure stuff, etc.You also need to have a reasonable environment where you can run your code very often comfortably, and be ready to print things or use a debugger to inspect what's going on. That could mean learning basic terminal commands, or maybe getting comfortable with an IDE.",

I know I used to like to take apart machines as a kid and look at all the parts very carefully.Anyway, that is the essence of object oriented programming, breaking up your problem into all the tiny \"machine parts\" (algorithms) that go into creating its solution. Then you \"just build your machine.\"The first thing I always do when approaching a new language is write myself my own line feed and derived console singleton so I can maintain consistency for console commands even if I look to compile in some other environment (which has never really happened except between Unity and Visual Studio).

Then you'll know more about how the data for each task should be structured, and you can hardcode some tasks, but make the display dynamic. Then figure out how to make a list of tasks, just so it is easy to view them!In a way, work backwards from the result on your screen, towards the data-structs or structures in your code.Then, when you can display the somewhat hardcoded list, write the code to change the status to completed, so you can see that it updates, and then the code to remove a task.Finally, as the last thing, write the code to add a new task to the list*\\*) note: In C++ it might actually be easier to add a task than remove one, I haven't touched the language in years.*",

However, if I want to learn something in depth, I think specific courses on Udemy are better, especially those courses which are updated often. Books are set in stone, so what you're learning may not always be the most up to date. However, if you learn well from books, O'Reilly has a massive collection. You can't download as a PDF/epub from the site, but you can download the books to read within the O'Reilly app on Android and iOS. There are supposedly some chrome extensions and tools which allow you to download the books as PDFs to bypass the rights restrictions, but to be honest if you're going to do that anyway, you might just consider downloading the books from illegitimate sources, as pretty much all the books are available from the usual pirated ebook places. That's a moral decision on your part - subscribing to O'Reilly means at least the authors are getting, I assume, a cut of the subscription fee if the books are accessed.",

But that's not something you'd know just because you knew C/C++.Different interviewers have very different styles, and also, many interviewers are bad at it and will reject you more or less randomly.

Not advanced stuff.\\~15 minutes of role-related knowledge questions. Again, the goal is to see if their resume is correct.

I would ask a question that a seasoned professional could solve in 10 minutes. The extra time was to allow the candidate to take time to disuss the problem, maybe have a false start or two, and still have plenty of time to get to a working solution.My general advice: Try to relax. Try to think out loud if you can - the interviewer is probably trying desperately to figure out how you think about problems and whether you consider alternative solutions and tradeoffs between different ways of answering questions or solving problems.",

Slap a bookmark and continue reading.Don't try to understand everything, or anything, to be productive while reading, or even worse: wonder what usable knowledge you're acquiring while reading. Books assume, and disclose an intended audience level of prior knowledge, but no one exactly matches that fully - there will be long parts that feel very wasteful, easy, \"duh\", but still not something you will learn by heart or ever have to. And also, you're not the author, so you don't need to feel that their explanations and lessons all make sense to you. There is no standard for how fast the books will teach what it talks about, so you'll likely discover much later if you're taking anything out of a book.So just having read is a great gain, trying to maximize the benefits will make you read slower, read less or feel pressured to be 'better' at getting your money and time's worth from books during reading or immediately after. Dont think about a hypothetical quiz at the end, you're reading for you. If you did the bookmarks thing, you will be able to come back, write down, practice, etc. later when you've already read the whole book.And why read? Well... Imagine having read 3 books about a subject instead of just a few pages out of one book. One might feel like there are better things to spend time on, but books are a very practical medium that doesn't require both hands like a computer would.",

For example, to fully grasp diabetes knowing what insulin actually does first helps a lot, but it’s not a hard requirement to understand the disease. Similarly för programming, learning the basics like stacks, pointers, arrays etc. will make further concepts so much easier to understand, but it’s not required.If you’re interested in AI you’d need at least a bachelors, and probobly a masters as well. AI works on a lot of linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. You basically have an input, break it down into a bunch of smaller components represented by numbers. You then feed these numbers through a magical web consisting of a 1000+ tunable dials which outputs a prediction. You need linear algebra to efficiently traverse this web, and you need the calc. to identify how *wrong* an AI and how to best adjust the 1000+ dials to make it less wrong.It’s never to late to start coding, it’s a really cool space and I hope you’ll enjoy it!Here are some videos graphically showing how AIs work:https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=XmQwghEwlM-x11H7",

As you become a better programmer, you should be able to \"run code in your head\", envision how it will work, and how it achieves your goal.If something isn't working right, that means there's a gap in your mental model — something in the code that you are understanding differently than how it actually is. You should seek to close that gap by understanding *why* it works differently than you expected, so that you can pinpoint the exact wrong assumption or belief that you had.Disclaimer — obviously, you can't know every piece of knowledge about every tool — you need to decide what is \"out-of-scope\" for you. As a programmer, at least your entire chosen programming language should be in scope for you.For example, I work in TypeScript, so for any issue that I run in to in my TypeScript code, I make sure to fully dig into it so that I can improve my mental model for next time. However, if my code encounters an issue when deploying to a Linux server, I may decide that I don't have an interest in Linux servers at the moment, so I might spend less time digging deeply to understand everything there is to know, or I may ask my co-worker who may be more experienced in Linux.",

Annoyingly, XCode only runs on MacOS too so if you don’t have a Mac you’re out of luck.Lots of cross platform apps these days like discord start out as web apps since so many people know web development, and use a framework like React Native or Electron to transform those apps into things that run on all sorts of other platforms, so you could start out by learning some basic web scripting in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If you want to learn fundamentals then really you need to look at one of the languages outside of the scripting convention. It really depends what you are looking to do development wise as to the route you should go though. If it's web, personally I'd say go with JavaScript over Python as that will let you cover FE development and limited backend through Node. When you are then ready to move onto a more robust backend and need something more powerful / designed for the task then go with C# or Go. If it's not the web side you are looking at then stick with Python as a scripting language then move onto something deeper like Go or C# (.net) or Java.",

Sounds cheesy I know, but a simple mindset shift will dramatically change your life. And one of the things is there are no easy shortcuts in life. Success is a difficult route, so you need to grind through the pain. With that said, go through the course and power through the difficult parts.

If your goal is to learn programming and have fun, and if you enjoy re-inventing certain wheels, then go for it!If you're just trying to deliver maintainable software in a business context then, generally, I think you should always re-invent the tiny wheels unless they are already solved by existing dependencies that are used in the codebase. The big wheels you should only re-invent if it's truly the project's area of innovation. The medium wheels are a bit more case-by-case but generally you shouldn't re-invent these wheels, either, without a good reason. But if for example, the medium wheel needs to be integrated in a novel way or or in a way that has to be coupled for performance reasons or other unusual considerations then it can make sense to re-invent even medium wheels. Just depends.Re: your JavaFX program, if it gives the results you want, you're fine. I don't know anything about JavaFX but If the UI isn't snappy you might want an event bus more for its asynchronicity than its decoupling purposes. I find an event bus annoying if not needed because things can feel like 1x1 squares and it can start to be hard to debug really complicated situations. I'd prefer a typical pub/sub approach if just trying to break the bi-directional dependency between the sub controllers and the top-level controller simply because it's easier to reason about and trace through the code than an event bus integration. But it totally depends on the scenario and the tradeoffs.",

Realizing your first solution isn't optional and making changes in order to fix it is invaluable experience that should be encouraged when you are in school.The use of libraries is more encouraged when you are getting paid for programming, but that decision is normally made by an architect or senior developer. Junior developers are expected to learn any libraries the senior members think would be useful for the project.Having experience using libraries is something you can add to your resume because that means onboarding will be faster if you know the technology stack. That means learning libraries is beneficial.Deciding what libraries to learn is complicated. You want to learn libraries that you enjoy using and are popular for a long time. Figuring out what libraries fit that criteria is difficult.",

Without the documentation and community knowledge to help. That relearning takes a long time, and isn't transferrable to another project with its own implementation. I will also say, there may be edge cases to your problem that only become apparent later, and you end up needing a more robust framework.

There's also a lot of value in understanding the code inside and out, even if it's not as streamlined / professional as it could be. This is 10x as true when you're learning!My guideline is to lean heavily towards \"roll your own\" on *anything* that is \"core\" to your project. Whatever the value add of your project is, **don't** outsource that to someone or something else, because that can leave you really vulnerable. It sounds like you're applying this principle well already. :thumbs_up:Also as a note... It's really unlikely that existing software is as fast as possible *for your specific use case,* because off-the-shelf software by it's very nature needs to be built more robustly to handle *multiple* potential use cases. If you could peak \"under the hood\" of the Google event service... You would likely find lots and lots of code and checks *your project doesn't need,* because it's written to be broadly applicable to multiple different kinds of clients. Which is all to say... I'm skeptical that it's actually faster, and if it is it's because you don't yet know how to write an optimized event service... Which is a *really good reason* to get experience writing event services. :upside-down_face:I definitely would use JavaFX or Swing, or w/e else for the \"skin\" of the UI, and not feel bad about it because it doesn't really impact the core of the project. If JavaFX suddenly (for some reason) became totally unavailable for you to use, you *could* totally re-write the GUI of the project to use Swing instead, and it would suck, but it would be doable. The *core* of the project would stay intact, and it would be just as valid and useful regardless of what the UI looks like.Where it's really tough, is when you're under a lot of time / financial / social pressure to release a finished project fast, and although you would *rather* roll your own for certain parts of the project... You're pushed towards using off-the-shelf solutions. I think in that case, all I can say is 1.) be careful about identifying which things are closer to the core of your project, and 2.) be reasonable and honest about the tradeoffs you're making.",

If you're working on a branch though, you've already got the version you're editing- you can pull master into your branch if you need to resolve merge conflicts, but you don't _need_ to pull master if all the changes that have gone to there aren't relevant to what you were working on (which is common when people are intentionally avoiding working on the same thing to avoid conflicts). When you finish the branch and merge it into master, it won't try to update backwards if you're missing some unrelated commits from master, which is why you don't necessarily have to pull.",

But honestly if this is the route you go (wrapping it with something like cordova) it didn't need to be an app in my opion. Alternately learn the native languages for each and rebuild or find a cross platform language and rebuild it.If the answer is no it doesn't need to be an app I would just make sure it's responsive so it looks good on the devices or if you are concerned about offline access look into PWA (Progressive Web App)",

The assignment criterion is based on the *shortest* distances.**Question 1:** Is there any significant difference between the execution times for **2** computers?Write a Python program for the scenario above and compare its execution time using 2 different computers. You need to run the program 50 times on each computer. You must provide the specifications of RAM, hard disk type, and CPU of the computers. You need to use a *shaded density plot* to show the distribution difference. Make sure you provide a discussion of the experiment setting.So now this is how I prepare my code for it (please refer above).Once done, for some reason, my shaded density plot to show the distribution difference is not showing a Curve plot.Based on my professor, it has to be a curve plot to show the shaded density plot.i am not able to get that, my plot is just a vertical line. i am sure something is wrong with my code, which is resulting it not showing a curve plot, but i am not sure which part of my program code is wrong. i may need some help on that. Did i make it clear this time?Appreciate the help pls.",

The idea of the data is pretty straightforward. list of customers + list of vaccine centers. customer location in standard long, lat structure. vaccine centers as well. So we just need to match each customer to the nearest vaccine centers, and that is what the machine requires to do. Once the matching is completed, the code will run it again for 50 times and keep track of the time completion for each round.Based on the data, we are talking about 1000 customers against 100 vaccine centers. So the program requires each customer to be matched to the nearest vac center.i am required to do this for 2 different machines, and we need to compare the time required to complete all 50 cycles between machine A against B. That is when the chart/shaded plot will show the variance of the 2 different machines.",

Sometimes it can be not initializing it or condition race, or some other nuance that happens. However, I only do that as a last resort. Breakpoints, step over and step into are nice, because you can see what is happening step by step.In web development, it can be server-side code mixed in client side, where it requires the ' instead of \" or sometimes miss spelling of html methods or even simple things like missing semicolon or the compiler removing shit with IntelliSense etc.I would even say unit testing could help fix bugs or find errors within logic of the code. This is awesome in figuring out edge cases or if QA reports an issue can you replicate it with a test environment. Then you can create code coverage for the future. I like this approach, because you can define a wide range of test for fun and see what fails and what passed and try to debug the logic or even step through specific cases.",

For example, in web development, if I'm passing a value from the backend to the frontend, I would first hardcode an expected value directly into the frontend to verify that the interface and frontend logic behave as expected. This helps determine whether the issue lies in the frontend or further back in the stack.Once the frontend behaves correctly with the hardcoded value, I would then pass the same value from the controller to confirm that the data flow through the backend to the frontend is working as intended. If this succeeds, I proceed to review the logic within the controller itself. Essentially, the idea is to work backwards from a known, working state toward the suspected issue.For game development, I take a similar approach. If, for example, I encounter a bug in a movement script, I would isolate that script by moving it to a new, minimal scene with a single object. Once it works correctly in isolation, I would then reintroduce the object to the original scene and observe whether the issue persists. This process of isolating and testing components individually allows you to narrow down the source of a bug systematically.In both cases, the principle remains the same: isolate, confirm working states, and incrementally trace the problem back to its origin.One last trick is the rubber duck, honestly works :flexed_biceps: explain what your trying to achieve to a rubber duck or colleague in the explanation, you will realize where you went wrong.Good luck, troubleshooting and debugging can be super fun when you get some wins :flexed_biceps::thumbs_up:",

Be happy to see red marks more than blue marks. Because every red mark is a step forward to improving your skill.and here are 2 things you can do also to help you 1. Read the Error Message Error messages are your first clue. They often point to the line number and type of error (e.g., “TypeError: undefined is not a function” in JavaScript). It might sound cliche, but most people really get stuck on a problem just because they didn't read the error message properly. And you will want to read error messages when you first 'befriend bugs'.2. Break your Code Intentionally Test small pieces of code to isolate the issue. Comment out parts to narrow down the problem.Remember that debugging is a skill. And the more bugs you deal with, the better you become at it. Solve it yourself first, and if you get really stuck on a problem, don't hesitate to ask others online. Pretty sure a lot of people can help you.",

I wouldn't do that when debugging.Normally I attempt to figure out where my code is getting unexpected results. As others pointed out a breakpoint is a good way to find that out. You can then look at the values of your variables while stepping through your code.If you're IDE doesn't allow for breakpoints then you can try adding print statements in your code in order to gather more information. This also works if you are testing in an environment that doesn't allow you to use breakpoints.Lastly you can try commenting out parts of your code. If removing a section of your algorithm fixes your issue you will know what code you need to focus on.",

I'd say PostgreSQL is the default database of choice these days, but since it's still SQL it might not even feel different to you.So that leaves the question of the server/backend technology, and I'd say it depends a lot on what exact application you're building:- If you'd get any benefits from having the backend in the same language as your frontend (JS/TS), and if your app is simple enough, you could just use Node or Bun or Deno to run JS server-side too. (Disclaimer: I am of the personal opinion that JavaScript is awful and should only be used for client-side code since it's built into every modern web browser, but I think I'm in the minority with that opinion)- If you're doing something science-y or AI-powered, python might be a good fit.- Lots of people like Java/Kotlin because of the stronger safeguards you get from compilation.- Golang (AKA \"Go\") also seems to be a popular compiled choice, but I personally dislike it for a variety of reasons.Regardless of your chosen programming languages and frameworks, you'll probably want to learn some of these other tools:- Git and GitHub- GitHub Actions- Cloud providers (e.g. AWS, GCP, SupaBase) and what they provide (e.g. S3/GCS, SQS/PubSub, secret managers etc.)Extra credit:- Docker- Kubernetes- Infrastructure-as-code (e.g. OpenTofu, Terraform)",

As of 2019, approximately 90% of Chinese international students return to China after completing their degree. The idea that the U.S. has been benefiting from a brain drain is no longer valid. The reality is that University admins love international students because they typically come from wealthy families, require less financial assistance and pay much more tuition. America’s top universities are sitting on fabulously large endowments and are fully capable of subsidizing the education of U.S. students in need. However, their highly paid administrators seem intent upon transforming these institutions into tax-sheltered political think-tanks rather than educating America’s best and brightest. Why should U.S. universities educate Chinese citizens in bleeding edge industries? Imo, we should be putting resources into US citizens.",

People in more junior roles do not get treated this way, generally. I'm able to do this because I can effectively delegate my work. People in junior to mid roles aren't delegating shit. And senior roles are being treated as the new mid, with companies hoping to hire two or three cooks in the kitchen. Honestly, it's not a bad strategy. It's a hell of a lot better than trying to throw more engineers at an issue to solve it faster. That was only ever annoying. The field is oversaturated because a bunch of universities for some reason think they can promise people jobs after they graduate. As if knowing what you're doing has anything to do with who's hiring. Why would you want to enter this industry from academia? There's no security. There are no pensions. Sometimes there is equity, but only with extreme risk. This industry favors the risk taking autodidact, and those very high salaries are punctuated with sometimes months long breaks in employment.This is not a traditional field, and people are in for a rude ass awakening. If you want more stability, go to industrial control systems, defense, or embedded. All of those people need very qualified and stable people.",

Outside of FAANG and Fintech, SWEs at \"normal companies\" honestly don't earn that much more than other white collar workers especially in this current job market.I also feel like the bar for entry has been raised a lot over the past few years. Companies that once only did behavioral interviews now do OA and LC type questions over multiple rounds to emulate big tech. It has also reached a point where there is no room for error during interviews, anything short of solving the problem using the optimal solution basically means a rejection.",

If I am XYZ Consulting and I have 10 devs on payroll, I can't replace them with the expensive model. I can 5x or 10x their productivity if I provide them the expensive model as a work tool.

I jumped into the market in the booming years following and have been very fortunate to be able to enjoy an IT worker’s market for many years where so many companies were desperate for good employees. Right now, it’s just not an employee’s market. The big tech companies and all the other smaller companies that look up to them are bracing for economic slowdown. They’re laying off hundreds of thousands of workers - flooding the labor market and increasing competition for the companies that are hiring. People don’t quit bad jobs - they quit bad bosses. Try to keep your head up and not take all of this too personally. No manager or person will ever be perfect, but I promise you will have much better experiences moving forward than you have had so far. It’s very hard to grow under an unsupportive manager, but it’s incredible what a supportive one can do for you when they learn and value your strengths.",

Don’t do more than you need to stick around and every time you want to do something extra at work make a mental note and put that energy into job searching.Also take time to document everything that you did in your time there somewhere that you won’t lose access to afterwards. It will help when people ask about your experience.And if you get a cool position afterwards, flex. People at your old job will see people leaving and get worried about their own jobs.

Honestly leetcode is only maybe 20% of the prep I do when I decide to job hop. Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me \"What's your favorite design pattern?\". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't \"Builder... because it's the only one I remember\". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions. But you should absolutely still expect to be asked questions about the basics and fundamentals. Even an hour of prep should make those kinds of questions trivial for you to answer.",

You have been doing PHP for 13 years and they ask such random PHP question that you couldn’t answer. That basically means that either you have just been fucking around with PHP for the past 13 years as a fraud, which I don’t believe, or the questions are just so arcane that you most likely wouldn’t have been able to answer even with preparation anyways.Also the recruiter has been completely misleading too, let’s not forget that part. You were told to prepare for sys design and some knowledge on redis/java, which had nothing on PHP. You were set up to fail from this perspective too.The company also clearly didn’t know what to do for interviews. Pop quiz on random knowledge is stupid and insane. They would have been better to give you a take home even.I just think calling yourself a failure after what clearly is failure on their part is unwarranted.

AI and automation is more likely to come for other jobs first. Yeah, lots of \"influencers\" seem to think programmers are out of a job within a year or two but realistically that's going to be more like a few decades. And jobs will shift around; not go away completely.I'm a senior SWE and I don't really use that much AI or LLMs. I use it like a tool: GitHub Copilot does a pretty good job of being an auto-complete on steroids. And other LLMs are great at helping me construct a complex SQL query. But I use them like tools to complete the task I need to complete. I don't really use them ever for system design or architectural decisions.My recommendation is to stay the course and get your degree!",

I had no idea and I wasn't ready to be a manager of others.Looking back, your manager needs to put aside through put to a degree whilst also acknowledging that maybe you don't want that person to work, maybe like I did all the time, they may regret not taking it a little slower and not enjoying the role more. And if they at all care about the person, they unilaterally should and it should be a concern discreetly shared to his peers, like you.As for letting him fail, I'm not surprised it being stated but still feel awful hearing other people say that and probably did about me. There's better ways and conversations then to just let someone drop and if I'm honest, you've probably got no idea if you're really testing him in the role. What I mean is, this may not be a strain for him or even considered work. This might be a passion and something they take a great deal of pride in and not even work but is paid to be. You have every right to raise a concern though and your manager needs to look at the person aspect. You all do but do it with them in mind as well as yourselves, maybe with their skills, they can learn to articulate them and go towards the team. It might be sensible to expect that the standard of work will improve and that doesn't have to be a bad thing (doesn't necessitate 'harder'). Hope that's helpful.",

I'd hazard a guess someone with a BS + 1-2 years of work experience would be more \"hireable\" than someone with an MS and no work experience for almost all fields. I did a semester of an MS in Computer Science before I got my first job, and I can confidently say I haven't used any of the things I've learned in the courses I took. School will teach you how to theorize, design algorithms, and a bunch of other stuff that most software engineers rarely need to do (and when they do, they can just use their critical thinking skills and Google lol). What it won't teach you is how to deal with stakeholders, find which of 90 microservices you need to connect to fetch a certain piece of data, office politics, prioritization and putting together a minimum viable product, dealing with ambiguous and poorly thought out requests from users, and a ton of other things that are actually useful in a real world software engineer job.

I actually believe the 30% of code written by AI because it is genuinely a super useful tool writing unit tests, boiler plate code, some specific LINQ or SQL query, etc. I don't think that statement is the equivalent of 30% of engineers are purely using AI to write their code while 70% are not. Even the smartest engineers I know use AI to help them write code. For the future, I think every developer is going to need to have a solid understanding of AI. I don't think you're going to need to know wtf backpropagation or deep learning is, but it'd be good to know how to write good prompts and how to leverage already available LLM APIs",

At which point the mass societal upheaval is going to make whether or not you have a job kind of pointless.

Employers want to see work experience.Everyone is struggling but I think it's slightly better for people with experience (\"slightly better\" implies it's still strugglefest tho). But so many experienced people have been laid off, too. I imagine that's why it's so brutal for entry level people. People with 1-2 years of experience are probably \"downgrading\" and taking many of those roles that would have gone to fresh grads so there's this nasty downstream effect.",

I passed 4 /5 which and they said it close but not enough to move to the next round. Second one was my fault for not asking how the test would be structured. I was studying SQL + python when I only should have studied python. Failed the assessment due to a few concepts that I've never needed to use and could look up in like 30 seconds.

But what makes you think anything would be different if you pivot to an entirely different career path? You're not going to be safe from getting fired or laid off if you jump into something like sales. You're not going to get any better growth opportunities than you do here.I read your other comment where you described what led to the issues with your past 2 jobs... what immediately jumps out at me is you're working at startups, or at least small enough companies where you're interacting directly with the founder, and the CTO. Startup environments like that are chaotic, and can be very exhausting, and aren't good fits for *most* people. I think you might be burnt out on startup culture, not the industry itself.Instead of abandoning your career entirely, have you considered looking for a more traditional job at a large company? Where you could work on a normal team, doing normal things, with normal expectations, where you aren't in a fast-paced high expectation environment where the founder or CTO aren't talking to you directly and are many, many layers removed from you and the work you do? Working a job like that will be like night and day from a startup.If you're truly no longer interested in the work, then by all means pivot. I'm just worried that you're thinking a pivot is going to be a magic cure that fixes all your problems. The grass is always greener and all that. I think changing the type of company you work for would be a much smaller and easier to achieve change that could be refreshing for you. You don't need to immediately jump to the nuclear option when there's still smaller changes you can make that could make a major difference.",

I saw a YouTube video that had an interesting idea. The problem is that you will likely have to go through some pain before you can get the benefits, though. It argued you want your finances in check and after that, be in a stable work situation. Part of your problem is that your current work situation sucks, so you feel pressure to find something better. You might not properly vet your next position, then you get caught in a vicious cycle. I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I was trying to get out of a job before I expected layoffs were coming, so I've accepted some less-than-ideal positions, and I've found myself with constant anxiety about needing to find something better. Perhaps you can find some small ways to get your sanity back. Yes, you'd like a new job, but maybe it's OK to just say you're not going to study for a month or two, and use that free time for something else. Do something relaxing, get some exercise, just something to hopefully help with healing. Then, when you start looking for another job, be mindful of vetting them. While you want a new job, you want to make sure you find something that aligns with what you want (work-life balance being a priority). Another option is to reach out to people you trust and see if their current companies are hiring. This depends on your network, though. If it helps at all, realize there are other people in similar situations. So, it's not an issue with you.",

        "body": "The answer is easy. AI 2027 is a load of crap that is literally coming off house rules table top guessing games. It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market. The AI 2027 paper was also spread ad nauseam by other people who have even More vested interest in the hype train staying rolling than the authors themselves. Not that I really care what Bill Gates says in a press release. It's not like he is transparently sharing insight or anything, it is also PR and marketing.I'm sure I'll catch plenty of downvotes over it, but you asked where we saw this going ourselves. Personally, I'm of the mind that AI is already showing fundamental issues that more compute won't solve, and there will be a breaking point that VC money stops fueling AI research companies. The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify. Think about how good and revolutionary Uber/DoorDash/AirBnB were when they first came out, and how those disruptor business evolved over time into nickel and dime hell holes. For all of those, we went from the old inconvenient model that had full time employees, to now the gig economy with no benefits and lower wages. We disrupted those markets so good. I'm well aware that I would be considered an AI pessimist, but it boggles my mind at how uncritically everyone is accepting a home brew board game research paper saying we hit singularity in 18 months. It feels like there is no space for caution or reasoning now that every tech illiterate middle manager thinks it's a freaking panacea for unlimited profit margin",

At the same time the world is under a worsening shortage of doctors which will only get worse with time for the foreseeable future. Taking into account economic and societal factors and the market behaving rationally, it only makes sense that automating doctors (at least family medicine for mostly healthy patients) would be the priority... But I'm guessing that slow regulations and irrationality means this won't happen as quickly as it should.Meanwhile, nothing excites developers more than building a new tool for developers. So that's where we're seeing most of the hype and movement right now. It's not really what the market needs but since we can't trust AI for much else, code generation becomes the focus. It doesn't hurt that good developers are expensive and there is potentially trillions in value if they can figure out a fully capable AI developer.",

        "body": "The recruiter is going just based on guidelines/direction they are receiving. They may have inconsistencies in their process. It's possible if you had gotten past the recruiter, it wouldn't have been an issue with devs you interviewed with. Every company will be different. To be perfectly honest, most of the companies I've interviewed at cared about explicit language experience. Once you're working there, they may throw you on a project where you don't have experience with the stack, but you're already being paid by that point. Someone I know who worked in the FAANG space said that language-specific experience seemed really bizarre to him. We can argue about what's fair and what makes sense, but it's ultimately the company's decision of how they want to evaluate candidates.Part of being more selective is because of the market. They can afford to be. A few years ago, the bar dropped quite a bit. There's also some argument for practical experience. Yes, you can have great fundamentals, but what about someone with great fundamentals and relevant experience? There's a strong chance that there are plenty of people who can pick things up and be successful, but they're just trying to have more of a \"sure thing.\"Here's another question. If you don't have Java on your resume, and it was a requirement, why would they even set up a call with you? It's a very flawed system.",

Also, you still haven’t told me the TC range.”Recruiter: “can you tell me what you’re expecting?”Me: “it doesn’t work like that. Per California law you post the range with the job. You’ve now told me the job, contracting agency, and end customer are all in California. *What is the pay range for this role?*”Recruiter: Me: “that’s way too low for this, thanks but I’m no longer interested.” That scenario has played out maybe 5-10 times over the last year almost verbatim. The last one tried to pull the car sales “let me speak to my senior manager and see what we can do…” and I just stopped responding. 100% of these recruiters have been Indian, educated solely or primarily in India, with work experience primarily or at least initially in India.

        "body": "Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. My advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! Assuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: As another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now. I'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example \"Docker\", \"React\" and \"Java\"). Here's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS. Maybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. I'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.I'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under \"additional experience\" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. For a template that has additional work experience I think the \"additional expereince\" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access). [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\\_wfma\\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)You might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. Anyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume. If you do change it up, you'll have to let me know if it made a difference.",

This will be your personal hub online.3. **Start building projects.** Not tutorials — actual projects. These can be small apps, websites, or utilities. The goal is to show that you can take an idea and turn it into something functional.4. **Push everything to GitHub.** Every project you build should live in a repository with: * Clear commit history * A good [`README.md`](http://README.md) explaining what it is, how it works, and how to run it * A live demo link5. **Deploy your projects.** Use Vercel, Netlify, or your own domain — but **host your projects and make them accessible**. Then add the link to the repo description. If a recruiter lands on your GitHub and sees a working app in one click, you’re ahead of 90% of applicants.6. **Let your work speak for you.** Don’t rely on a resume filled with buzzwords and no substance. When you have no formal experience, your **projects** ***are*** **your experience**. Your portfolio *is* your resume. Show what you can build, how you think, how you write code, and how you solve problems.**Bottom line?** If someone clicks on your portfolio or GitHub, they should instantly know what you're capable of — not by reading, but by *seeing* it in action.",

        "body": "One very important thing to keep in mind is that the markets from 2010-2022 were not all the same. We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.That said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the sameFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.AI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different. A company that laid off a bunch of employees because of AI-hype might be desperate to hire a ton more employees a year from now to fix all the shit that the vibe coders did.",

Things are just so different now. AI is an excuse for layoffs, not the root cause. A moderately skilled engineer still does a better job than AI tools. Often because you have to know what is actually a good solution and how to prompt your way to it. It’s easy to see it do tricks and get excited, but it’s not replacing real experience for a while. Many big businesses are messy, hesitant for countless reasons, or existing code just too complicated for it to work right now. Can’t say that will be true forever. The economy, at least in the US, depends on consumers consuming and a top fraction exploiting everyone else’s labor. Billionaires are living proof that there is no end - there is seemingly not limit so the cycle continues. Probably until enough people have nothing to lose and revolt.

My point is, if you’re interested, ask around, and then give it a shot. You might find out you don’t like the work, which I found out about a ton of professions. Best thing to do is try it instead of sitting around wondering.",

Without a positive keeping you here, the negatives of weather and COL will become overwhelming.2. Does advancing in your career matter to you? There are more high paying but demanding software jobs available in the Seattle area than anywhere except the Bay Area. If you care about growing your career or making more money, there are more opportunities. If you care about having a chill job where everyone works less than 40 hours a week, you're probably going to find these demanding jobs miserable eventually.Hybrid in Seattle is fine if your employer has a good office and you have an easy commute to it. Those who hate working in the office the most where I work all have long, hellish driving commutes. If you can walk, bike, light rail, or bus to downtown in a small amount of time, or have a short driving commute to a suburban office park based job, it is much more manageable.",

The name probably has a leg up when it comes to recruiting, but the difference is small unless you work on something notable (in IS&T… you probably won’t).I got interviews at OpenAI, every other FAANG, Uber, etc etc and my Amazon experience was the focus of most discussions (mainly because it was most recent, but partly because it was more challenging work).In general, IS&T is a shitshow. Many contractors who, frankly, could not pull their weight. Apple is also frugal - despite, again, Amazon’s reputation here, Apple is pretty similar (low PTO, very few “freebies”, pays less than AMZN etc). In general though, I still think Amazon is a worse place to work. Culture sucks, too much bureaucracy, and a lot more busy work than what I had at Apple.To be completely honest, if I were in your shoes, I’d choose the place you’d rather live: Austin or Seattle. Spend time building connections, making friends, etc. Personally, I’d aim to do good work and bounce within 2 years. Your exit opportunities should be similar.",

When I first started, I was told \"Go build an integration between our product and X CRM\" and that was about as much interaction as I got.Same thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.My advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.When I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.Nobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.I adopted the mantra \"Not my circus, not my monkeys\" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.Put forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.I could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",

Wait until you find out how little support you'll get at the average FAANG.What have you tried so far? Have you tried sending PRs to add/improve docs whenever you do finally figure something out? Have you talked to the other engineers about this?> Unrealistic expectationsThat's literally every company. It's your job to push back and manage expectations.It's very easy at your level. You just \"yes and\" everything. Examples: - \"Sure, I can definitely do that. It will take N days instead of the 2 you've suggested, though, because .\" - \"Yes, I can prioritize this, but I'll have to put aside the other tickets on Foo and Bar, which will delay those by 42 days.\" - And so on. You get the idea.> Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way).This is pretty common in major cities for serious tech jobs. Lots of people start with this and then work their way up to a better situation.My roughest commute back in the day was a drive to the train station (which had to be ass-early to get there in time to get parking), a train ride, and then a 1 mile walk from the train to the office. Then, in the evening, I'd do the whole thing in reverse. I dealt with it 5 days a week for a year, then got a better job. C'est la vie.I recommend a nice pair of noise-canceling headphones and a playlist of your favorite podcasts. It's temporary, and you'll have a better job with a better commute sooner or later, but in the meantime there's no need to suffer unnecessarily. Use the time to decompress or study, and be glad the noise-canceling headphones are way better these days than 10 years ago.",

You will quickly get used to getting things done quickly and effectively and learning how to manage priorities and getting confidence to innovate. You would also likely build a much stronger network and bond with the startup team than the run of the mill mature larger company with a lot more established processes. Most likely you will also quickly outpace the average FAANG engineer in terms of upskilling and improving by far. But this is all assuming you can pull your weight in the startup and not get let go for underperforming in the first month and also assuming the startup itself is a good environment (good leadership/mentors/culture, etc). The answer to this is how risk averse you are and how willing you are to put in work and what your priorities are. The smaller the startup, the more brutal it will be in terms of workload and expectations and “hire fast, fire faster” is the norm but there are benefits to it that I mentioned above. The larger the company is, you will have more stability but the work in general tends to be more boring with less agency, you don’t learn as much as quickly as at a startup, and the amount of process and red tape required to do things get more and more overwhelming. This leads to a lot of incompetent people that are just coasting and coworkers that are dead weight in larger companies whereas in a startup they would be canned in a week.To me, your situation is not about the difference in pay at all. It is not relevant. The startup will have you work many more hours than the government job so if you account for hours worked, the government job would technically be higher pay.",

Previous employer responds with yes, or no, and practically nothing else for liability reasons3. Prospective employer says thanks, hangs up the phoneAnd if your title/tenure doesn’t at least kinda match what is in your previous employer’s ERP, you have introduced a new line of questioning for your prospective employer.In so far as job seeking is concerned, nothing title-wise really matters outside of very large tech companies with well understood levels. The sort of stuff you see on levels.fyi. What you actually did in the role, and how it’s represented on a CV/resume, is the more important thing.You can certainly lie about what you did, and be reasonably confident those lies aren’t surfaced as part of a routine background check. Most people are terrible liars, and worse liars in the context of a job interview.If you care about whether you’re growing appropriately, focus on engineering management and staff+ roles. Plenty of very good books/blogs on those specific career paths exist.

Will probably be able to handle some of the smallest task the team does without direction, likely because they’ve done something like that task about a dozen times now. I’ll say this is someone about 6-24 months on the job.Mid: Solid understanding of the Tech Stack and Code Base. Likely capable of giving some input on smaller tasks. Should be able to handle medium sized, week long tasks with just a Q&A session for clarification. I’d say this can go from about 3 years to around 7 depending on the person.Senior: Should know the system and tech stack (assuming they aren’t new to the team) well enough to discuss architecture with others as well as give input on a wide range of things with the code base. Should need very little guidance outside of larger tasks, even then it’ll likely fall more into a requirements clarification discussion like “Should this button open a dialog with an are you sure prompt, or simply bounce them back to another page?” than an actual “I need help with this”. I’d say this is most people with 5-6 years of experience.These are blurred lines though and people mature faster than others, no doubt there’s guys better than Seniors with just 18 months of experience and guys who are barely better than Junior’s with over 10 years of experience (probably when a lot of the “I have 13 YOE and can’t find a job” posts get made)",

This will also tell you how the company at large handles these situations where a single team is under-staffed.Regardless, you should try to look at this an opportunity for your personal development. You have a great chance to learn a lot here and earn a strong reputation in your current company. If you have a good manager he should understand your side of the situation, and try to support you.If you get more people, that’s great, I wouldn’t worry too much, there’s very few downsides in the long run. You’ll learn from the principal engineer and have a team to rely on.If you don’t though it’ll obviously be harder for you and the team. You’ll still learn a lot, and there’s a great leadership opportunity there for both yourself and the other engineer you’ll be working with, but yes you’re right it’ll be more stressful for you both.IMO it depends on how much the company is willing to support the team. I was in a similar situation about a year ago and the company gave the bare minimum support, and basically told our manager to make it work. I left after about 6 months of that pattern.",

Since you're being given a 6-month window, you can ask about things like backfilling. But, it takes time to hire people, especially the right people. There's no guarantee you'll find someone before the other dev leaves. There's also no guarantee the new person is actually good. So, for the overall stability of the team, it's good that the knowledge be shared/spread around.Ask your manager about the backfill and your concerns about workload, due to handling all the requests from the customer. Hopefully, they will help manage that. This might be a really great opportunity, or it could turn into a nightmare. At least some of it will be impacted by your attitude going into it. There are a lot of times in life something will come up, and you won't feel ready. But a lot of people rise to the occasion. And if you don't, hopefully you can still learn from it.",

Ford CEO is more incompetent than a lump of rock. He missed every opportunity and let the Chinese cars bend him over drive under him banging his balls. But he only woke up 10 years later to buy a Chinese car and praise it. He is still the god damn CEO.So competency in workplace is overrated.Look for self improvement and self satisfaction. Screw what others think. If you go broke no one's coming to help you. It doesn't matter you are a diversity hire or a creme la creme.",

Applying to jobs *is* a full-time job - it's a volume game and you need to be comfortable with that.3. It's not doomed, but it will be hard and will take time. In your case, it's really important you have your resume as tight as possible - maybe some resume meta gaming to get past recruiters and ats. Share your anonymized resume and I can provide some feedback.4. upskilling will help, strong personal projects, masters if you have the ability to do so, etc.5. Good luck in your search",

Evidently some ATS systems go way out on a limb to assume that `.in` TLD means I must actually be in India. So if you're doing anything similar, be careful. Just use a gmail address.For the job I noticed that with, I was super interested so reached out to the recruiter directly on LinkedIn, and after some back and forth she set me up with a zoom interview with a VP who clearly thought I was part of one of those \"proxy interview\" scams where one person interviews and then a totally different person shows up for the remote job, and didn't want to be there from the beginning. I get it, I've been an interviewer with some of those. This is a very paranoid environment.

If you come up with a bad or mediocre solution after not vocalizing anything, I'll think you don't know what you're doing and if you somehow miraculously come up with the perfect solution with no apparent thought process that also reinforces the idea that you've got some sort of cheating situation going on.I don't want to see you type out a good solution, I want to know how you determined that was a good solution. I want to know why you choose a dictionary or a stack for this solution. I want to know that you thought through the brute force solution and how you got to your improved option. I'm totally stream of consciousness on coding problems, but, I will make sure I preface things. I will vocalize that I like to think through the brute force or basic solution first and identify the deficiencies. This should take like a minute, during which you can formulate specifically why your eventual solution is the right one.Also make sure to explicitly tell them if you put them on a different monitor from your coding so they understand why you're looking to the side if you are doing that.I'm looking for basic coding skills and understanding how you problem solve.

Useless meetings should be removed from your calendar. If you lead a team, starting delegating projects that don't further your career or could help less experienced engineers or talk to your manager on priority shifting. Minimize \"emergency\" fix requests and asks as much as possible. Time block the projects that are important on your calendar and get that work done. This has made a huge difference for me personally.",

Either way you may get laid off.If the pay is significantly more, don't take part in lifestyle creep, just put that extra pay aside till you ahvea year's living saved up, and now you're pretty good in case you are laid off, but depends how much more the pay actually is and how much self control you can muster for resisting spending the extra pay. THe reality is, we have no idea, neither do you. You just need to look at your situation in life, look at the companies/projects and whether they're likely to go through layoffs, and decide just how much happier you'd be in the new company. If the pay was significant (15-20k more) and I liked the new role a lot more, I'd go for it and just keep saving every penny I could till I had a decent nest-egg, but I'm OK with risk as I don't have kids to pay for.",

No AI generation, IMO those sound so fake and such insincere BS.  Get a template going written uhhh ‘from the heart’ and tailor it per company based on the company’s mission statement on their website, and include some things from the job posting as to why you would be a good fit and how much this would mean to you, and you believe in their mission of xyz  - something like that-focus on applying locally, hybrid or on site.  Remote jobs are flooded with hundreds of applicants, all with the same AI generated buzz-word-salad, I have no idea how HR swifts through them without choosing the completely wrong people. In my experience hospitals, local colleges and some insurance companies have easier interview processes with easy programming tests/questions (as they’re usually behind on the times, err…)-get a friend to do a mock interview with you, get them to ask questions a company would, and get their input on your answers.  or if you have no friends, watch YouTube videos on interviewing questions and how to answer them well, and practice in front of the mirror-also I agree with other comments, leave your gpa out and don’t say you were let go due to performance.  If anything you can turn this into a decent “what’s a flaw you have” answer…. I actually used this on my interview (that I got the job for).  I said I had a problem saying no, and take too much on and get stressed out.  But that I have learned to prioritize better and set better expectations with others.  This might help you exceed more in your new role too, sounds like you were like me. Good luck",

It is subsidized by the unlimited money faucet of Ads to do cutting edge shit that may or may not benefit the company; their spending power is basically incomparable to the others. Keep in mind we also have in house TPUs we vertically integrate while the others have to rely on Nvidia for their compute.

So if your goal is to climb the ranks to staff to senior staff to principal or director or VP, Meta is better there.Anthropic is a hotter name than Meta. This will potentially open more doors. It is very unlikely you'll be able to \"trade in\" L5 at Anthropic for L7 or higher at a big tech, so in that sense it's definitely not more valuable than L6 at Meta for career progression. However, you might be able to trade it in for something like a director at a startup based on the name more easily than with Meta.And of course maybe you'll get promoted faster at Anthropic than Meta. I also wouldn't bet on this though because Anthropic is pretty mature at this point.If growth means gaining more skills and working with more competent people, then Anthropic hands down. The work is likely to be more novel and your colleagues are likely to be stronger.Finally, you shouldn't assume the equity at Anthropic is worth more than the equity at Meta. If the numbers are higher at Meta, Meta is offering you more. (In fact since Anthropic is private you should be considering their equity as something of a discount compared to their face value, but you say you don't care about that.)",

        "body": "Here's some actually helpful advice:1. Make maintaining good work/life balance an explicit goal. If you budget your time like you have 60 hours a week, you will be working 60 hours a week. Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (\"what is X?\", \"how do I do Y?\"), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie. Work 45 hours a week and tell people you're working 60.",

Where there is no hesitation to drop new hires at their 3 month reviews.And it is stressful, but it's not all bad. In a way, it can feel a lot worse to be in a role where you coast, aren't learning or improving, and are bored. Managing stress is just another skill to master, learning how to stand up for yourself, how to shut off work and enjoy your personal life.

So there are definitely companies willing to give older people a go.The disability could be another issue. I don't agree with it at all, but sadly remote work is being more and more rare with at least 3+ days in the office being the norm here.

The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people. Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up. Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree. This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.On majoring in CS: choosing CS because you \"like math and computers\" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good. This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another. That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors? While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.On getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now. Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background? Probably. But would it be so bad that you would regret even \\*trying\\* in the first place? Some people on this sub may say so, but that outlook has a nasty habit of becoming self-fulfilling.",

If you're picking CS because of remote work, you're mostly wasting your time unless you've been lucky with lottery tickets because remote job is the dream job. Most roles require in-person nowadays. Don't get fooled by the cheap or free tuition from the state if the bargain requires majoring in something CS or IT related. This field is way, way oversaturated thanks to Learn2Code.

If I were in your shoes, I'd try out some free resources before signing up for any classes. Check out CS50 for a formal introduction, I've heard it's a bit difficult but it's a great intro to programming and CS fundamentals. The Odin Project is a great starter resource if you're into / want to try web development. If you choose the school route, go to a community college first to save some money, then transfer to a state school. See if you qualify for any grants. If not, check out scholarships. Regardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note. Do your own research, make a plan (budget, time, courseload) and look into possible programs. Do you have any connections in the industry? Even a connection in something software-adjacent, like IT, would be valuable. Any sort of connection would help. Even a help desk job, or some IT position on campus would be great, assuming it makes financial sense for you. Sign up for CS50 or start The Odin Project to see if you enjoy this stuff. I can't speak for CS50, but the actual CS degree would be different from The Odin Project. The common ground is problem-solving. Just see if you enjoy the actual problem-solving process, whether it's practical or theoretical.Best of luck!",

It will help you build you resume (which is extremely important as an older student) and it will help you find out what parts of CS you do and don’t like. Given you like tech and visual arts I would suggest game design but that industry has a really bad reputation. But maybe you can do some indie stuff with it. As an older student I would go with what another commenter basically said, you’re starting your career way too late to have a “serious” career. You might as well try to follow your dreams and do something you’ll love regardless of the money. Hopefully this helps some. Also beware there are a lot of doomers in CS and generally those seem to be people unwilling to move or who were only in it for the money. So take things with a grain of salt.

It gives you great financial security, and the ability to actually use your passion in a risk-reduced way. For me, it all still worked out because my company became wildly successful, but if I had to follow generic advice it would be that.",

There were all these rules about how the robot could move and pick items that make no sense for an Amazon warehouse, but make perfect sense if you’re familiar with Boggle, but the interviewer never mentioned Boggle.

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like \"you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed\".The other thing I don't like about leetcode questions in general is that we can't use debugging tools. I use my IDE to debug my code, to understand where my logic is wrong, to better understand my thought process and to fix them accordingly. This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up. Sometimes print statements are not helpful because you don't know where you are going wrong. It all takes time.It's like they are looking for robots/AI who can process everything in seconds and write up a solution in minutes. It's like they are not looking for humans.To solve these questions, you need to have tons and tons of of leetcode practice. It's why I tell everyone to start DSAs asap, and to start leetcoding asap. It's the only way to match a robot/AI when it comes to big tech leetcode questions.",

It requires a deeper understanding of the problem and solution to be able to connect the dots when it's not as obvious.

You may have these loaded up for you by a project manager/agile coordinator or may have to pull them yourself, position dependent.If you are hourly you will likely need to enter hours worked into a time-tracking system assigned to the correct client code. You may also have to do something similar in a salaried position, but it's usually mostly for PTO tracking purposes unless you are doing agency/consulting work for multiple clients or business verticals.Most places in the US are expecting at least 40 hours of time a week. Most aren't sticklers about it, but some places (especially micromanage-y or \"productivity focused\") can get really in the weeds about how you're spending your time \"on the clock\", even if you're salary.Expect to have \"core hours\" for your day when you're reachable. These are generally around 10am-4pm local time, but you're often expected to work at least 9am-5pm/6pm daily. Many places will also expect you to set up chat/email on your phone so you can reply to random messages managers send when they're anxiety working on the weekends, feel free to ***not*** do that though, setting boundaries early is a good thing.",

I've noticed that you really have to make an effort to get to know your co-workers because water cooler talk is non-existent. You want to get to know your co-workers because you want to be able to work with senior/principal engineers. The jrs who have a good upper level engineer on their side are usually the ones who succeed. It's hard to create the connection online because everybody is so busy and if they arent they arent trying to have DM chats with their co-workers. Also you never have that transition so it is very easy to work 10+ hours without realizing it. Becuase yo uarent sure if others have left or not and sometimes doing an extra 30 minutes because you can and are waiting for something to finish building is easy to do with your laptop in the other room. Again all this is job and team dependent. I will let you know that one thing that is never really said when you are in college is that many of these jobs are not really 9-5. Salary means you work to get the job done wheher it took you 20 hours or 60. Sometimes it's even a game you have to do. Because if you did a task in 20 and tell your boss, he might just give you two bigger tasks right away.",

What kind of personality traits and such do I care about? What kind of work will the people be doing? What are positive signs? What are negative signs? And they will study the job description. They will ask how I'm going to run the interviews etc.Then they go out, and find a few people's resumes and we do expectation setting. They ask what do I think about these candidates? And I say I don't like the way the resume's formatted, I expect to see these kinds of things etc. We go back and forth a few times, before he starts sending me people he's interviewed and have passed the test. He sends me interview requests for next stages of the interviewing and after I interview the candidate we go through the expectations once more. This person did really well but didn't meet these requirements, and that again helps him narrow down his own HR screening process.Through none of this process, is anyone asking me if Springboot is Java, or if Laravel is PHP. The recruiter is not a developer, and has never coded before, and it's not even going to be a thing he considers or even thinks about, because it's not his domain of expertise, and I'm being asked like 50 questions and it's not on my mind either.",

At the moment asking them to take my JafaFX dialog and put it in a JDialog to make the dlg modal over Swing controls. No LLM can do something this simple, they all fuck it up. And this is one class without much complexity. They are a long way from being let loose on our 10 million line codebase of bespoke classes. I was looking at one of my kids homework assignments the other day as she could not figure it out. I started with LLMs but they could not do C allocation and deallocation. Only because the assignment used an int\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* for an array of ints, instead o int\\*. It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment. I only find AI useful for small well defined pieces of code. What would have taken an hour to find on the web and then tweak for my use case, can now be done in a few minutes. It is great for that sort of thing. But you better understand the code it gives you and be able to debug/refactor/modify it. In the future there could be breakthroughs that get us AGI and then it is game over. But I think it will be for every job if that happens.",

Access to the latter category of jobs will increasingly be gated on pedigree: where you went to school, who you interned with, where you previously worked. Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). This is already how it works in other fields like law and finance. In finance there is retail finance and high finance. In law there’s big law raking in big bonuses and local firms that aren’t. In both cases it’s nearly impossible to jump from the low track to the high track. There’s no meaningful path for the guy making loans at the local credit union to get to blackstone PE.",

They just need to hire a good applicant who can do the job, and they absolutely need to avoid lemons. So, maybe the best applicant went to a regional campus, and you'd miss them by only looking at kids who went to the state's flagship school; but on average, the kids that went to the flagship school will probably be good enough, and just like that 1,000 resumes became 100 resumes.Note that I am *not* saying this is ideal, equitable, etc. But unless or until the market turns around, it seems inevitable.",

Sure, if we get a higher salary the recruiter gets a slightly bigger cut, but the recruiter would rather lowball you and get you placed fast. The higher the salary you demand, the harder you are for them to place. They'll do anything they can to get you placed *anywhere*. A cut of a lowball $60k offer is better than a cut of $0. They don't care if the company is toxic, boring, and a bait & switch, they get paid either way the minute you accept the offer.I'm not a fan of 3rd party recruiters. I've never felt the need to use one, I've always had a fine time finding job postings and getting interviews on my own.",

A single 6 month stint is pretty easily explained away as something you gave a solid shot (you didn't leave after a month or anything), and it just ended up being a bad fit.The alternative is having a 6 month career gap. So pick your poison, a 6 month stint, or a 6 month career gap. Both *could* cause you issues, but I think the former is less likely you cause issues.You can also A/B test both options so you can see how the market reacts first hand.

Unless you're trying for FAANG, there is little to no technical interview in my experience. If you do get asked questions, they're usually very easy.For one of my past internships, I got asked an (easier) variation of the fizzbuzz problem.

Interviewers might start using more original questions and guarding them from being posted publicly. Services like HackerRank seem to be pretty good for this already and probably have pretty large private question banks. The cheat detection tools will likely get more sophisticated too. In person interviews might make a comeback. This has been said but they companies might start trending toward getting people on site for technicals.Move away from leetcode to open-ended technical questions. I have had just as many of these as leetcode style interviews, or at least some marriage of the two.Pair programming. This is still probably one of the common ways to do a technical. My current job was gained through a pair programming exercise. Here you can put in a leetcode style puzzle that might be harder to see coming and cheat through. Yes, I think it will trend away from purely online leetcode questions and LLMs are disruptive but they don’t necessarily spell the end of leetcode style interviews.",

The fact that you could answer those questions minutes later proves you do know the material.The harsh truth is that interviews are partly a numbers game, and this one experience doesn't define your capabilities or close all doors. Instead of beating yourself up, channel that energy into preparation for the next opportunity. Those forgotten concepts you looked up? You'll never forget them again now.

I'm now ***18 years*** into my career, and I'm already planning to leave this place when the market improves enough to look for something better. My average tenure is around 2 years, and I've found that I'm almost always ready to move on for more money and a change in scenery by then.I also do hiring with some frequency, and let me tell you that ***some*** short tenures on resumes don't really bother me much at all. This career doesn't have much stability and finding a good fit can be really hard.Additionally, my experience has been that people who stay with the same employer for long periods of time (5+ years) tend to have less varied/useful amounts of experience and will not generally have as versatile (or up-to-date) a skillset as someone who has had 3 different jobs in the same amount of time.There's definitely a lower limit though, a career that's only multiple years of 6 month contracts/employers, for example, does not look great to anyone, as it appears to signal that the employee can't ever meet expectations well enough to stay on anywhere.",

The key is making sure your projects stand out - instead of building generic todo apps, try to create something that solves a real problem or demonstrates genuine technical curiosity. Focus on one language really well rather than jumping around, and make sure you can explain every line of code in your projects because interviewers will dig deep. When you do start interviewing, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky technical questions and coding challenges that often trip up newer developers - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people handle the pressure of real-time problem solving during interviews.",
