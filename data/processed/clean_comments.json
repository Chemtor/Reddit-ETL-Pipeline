I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved. It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on \"hard mode\" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style. Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.We are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.>How did you push through? Or did you change direction?I have always loved computers and technology. I changed careers to DE. Much happier now.",

For Python I picked up [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359/) and that helped me get a deeper understanding of the language beyond just copying code or relying on AI.

Airflow has operators, which are essentially wrappers for python code, API calls, etc to simplify (in theory!) the deployment process, make it more repeatable and reduce boiler plate code. Dagster is the same but it doesn't use Airflow operators. Instead they're using assets, sensors, etc. If you're new to it, I'd start with Dagster. Not so much for the orchestration side of things but rather the deployment. Airflow is a kubernetes first architecture and it's a ball ache to install and run locally if you don't know what you're doing.",

It worked well and it think can probably handle a lot more complexity than I tried with it. I’d imagine you could certainly run into limitations compared to a purely custom coded solution, but it’s nice. And when building your own you can give it the documentation and an AI tool tries to build it for you. Your mileage may vary and it didn’t really do what I wanted so I didn’t use it. The other great thing about it is that you can self host. I haven’t tried but the docs make it seems straightforward enough. Then it’s free (other than Infrastructure costs) and you don’t have the normal vendor lock in.

This should solve your API maintenance challenge.Your Airflow instance should only do one thing that is triggering dbt build job after Integrate completes the loads.

From a Hudi angle, it is not just an open table format though. It is an end-to-end *lakehouse platform*, that integrates \"storage engine\" capabilities (much like a DBMS) with a table format (the metadata) on top of open file formats such as Apache Parquet.Hudi offers built-in services for ingestion (like Hudi Streamer), table management (clustering, compaction, cleaning, rollback), and catalog syncing. These services are deeply integrated and natively supported, allowing for fine-grained control over write-side performance (with the ability to run asynchronously/inline), recovery, and data quality. Work is also underway to add a multi-tenant caching layer that bridges fast ingestion with low-latency querying across engines. With just open table format (vs lakehouse platform), you outsource these services/capabilities to the compute/catalog layer. These literatures should shed some more light: \\- [https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/open-table-formats-and-the-open-data-lakehouse-in-perspective](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/open-table-formats-and-the-open-data-lakehouse-in-perspective)\\- [https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison)\\- [https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/03/05/hudi-21-unique-differentiators/](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/03/05/hudi-21-unique-differentiators/)",

Everything is SQL-first and it's full featureset is exposed via SQL. It performs well and behaves just like you'd expect a database to behave. I hear they know how to charge though.BigQuery is nice in that its fast and  supports a wide range of operations but it's super annoying in that its concept of catalog / database is an entire GCP project which you can't just issue a `CREATE DATABASE` call to spin up a new one. So you're mostly limited to schemas and tables to structure your data. Also a bunch of operations are only available via its API instead of via SQL which grates me.Databricks is the PHP of data platforms, it feels like a bunch of random shit thrown together. SQL support is an afterthought (although to be fair improving all the time) and if you're going to use DataFrame's then you're going to need to spend more time understanding the nuances of Spark and optimizing your code. They're also heavily into notebooks and push them for things that notebooks are not good for, like robust data pipelines. I hear it's comparatively cheap though",

They're reliable SQL and REST API call generators, more or less, and do pretty much what you'd expect.I often recommend them for the extract step. They can save a ton of boilerplate and handle all kinds of logging and monitoring for you.But I seldom recommend them for transformations and usually suggest dbt instead. Plain SQL is both faster and easier to work with, in my experience, once you've ingested the data. (Maybe low-code is still quicker if transformations are trivial, but nobody hires me in that case anyway!)The irony is that I always hear vendors pitching the transformation capabilities hard, and suggesting that *that* will make customers faster, more productive, etc...as though the need to write SQL was the real bottleneck. So management buys it on that premise, doesn't get the massive boost they anticipated, burns an insane number of cloud credits in the process, and enthusiasm wanes.(Bear in mind nobody's calling me when things are going great, so this isn't necessarily representative.)",

The best version of this software still runs on local machines.* AI suddenly made programming language solutions “simpler” for business users to create small ETLs and local automations. A few years ago, these users would have made the transition from Excel to Alteryx/KNIME paying for the server and consultants with a smile on their face.* They haven't been acquired by industry giants. At the time of the recent acquisition of Alteryx, it was even rumored that Salesforce or Oracle might acquire it. It didn't happen, and fighting Microsoft/AWS/Google alone is a hopeless task.* Death of communities. Part of what justified buying Alteryx licenses was how active and helpful the user community was, but just as is happening with Stackoverflow, AI is taking away the relevance of these communities.",

I kind of thought DE might be harder than SWE to get good results from given that much of the context is about the data and that's not something the AI trained on. It's great for stuff like building a front end app where there are tons of examples on Github, but not so much build the revenue fact table for XYZ inc. with all their proprietary business logic and terminology.

That way, once everything is planned out and you're ready to start, you can just tell the AI basically: \"follow this planning doc, and after you complete each step, update the doc and begin the next step\", and then you can just keep hitting the OK button until it's finished building everything.",

Open a PR, reviewer can just query the virtual env created, meaning no more schema/copy of data per user. We have 50+ users.- Virtual env is almost always cheaper also on your warehouse, as you don’t double run things- no more Jinja/Yaml mess- the open source product is the same as the enterprise model. Current DBT trajectory is not good in this regard, although I understand they need to make money!- the CI/CD bot is actually good and means you can get set up on github very quickly. Longer term you’ll end up using an orchestrator, but for a PoC it’s very quick and easy- TESTING. It’s actually good. DBT testing is painful and frankly bad- It does a really basic thing of copying grants on objects. Sounds simple, but it means you can manage your infra outside of your transformation codeNegatives?- bigger learning curve. If you come from engineering it’ll be simple, if you’ve spent your time writing SQL you’ll need to do some upskilling- less resource online, although the slack is very good at sorting things- You will find bugs if you are doing non standard things. The team fixes these, but they do exist!",

Based on what I've understood so far, this is definitely at least a few weeks of work for my team, because we'll first need to crank the wotsit then analyse the doohickey, before we can build the XYZ itself.If applicable, you also need to make the distinction clear between how long _once the project starts_, and the lead time _before you can start the project_. How you do that depends how projects/work items are prioritised at your place, but make sure to set expectations that the work isn't going to start right away, unless of course it can. **If you do this well, after enough repetitions, the \"easy\" people will learn more about how things work and probably won't say it any more.**### footnote(1) Honest doesn't mean as low as possible. Include padding for uncertainties, include time needed for adequate testing, documentation, etc. Honesty does include communicating the error bars on the estimate; I like Uncle Bob's approach of providing three estimates, a worst-case, best-case, and likely middle-ground. Honesty also means not being more precise than justified: eg \"a few weeks\" is better than \"3 weeks\" if you don't have enough information to be really sure it's 3 weeks.",

You have to be the salesperson and gatekeeper for your team and not everyone is ok with that type of work.The job itself is only part of the decision, there’s always the opportunity cost to consider. What would you be doing if not for management? Applying for other jobs, learning a new technology, honing your craft? The more enticing the alternative the worse of a decision accepting a management path is.If it were me I would take it. I’ve done the Individual Contributor side for over 15 years now and I’m ready for a more strategic role. I’m good as an IC and I’ve held a team lead position in the past, but I swerved back to IC because I enjoyed having complete control over my own success.

        "body": "The key thing you should ask yourself: Do you \\_want\\_ to be a manager, or do you prefer working as an IC (individual contributor)?Managers are people people. You will reduce the time you spend doing the work (writing spark code or w/e your niche is) and you will increase the time you spend on meetings, \"people problems\", and company politics. Especially if your have a decently sized team (6+ direct reports) you can expect to spend about 0% of your day writing code and 100% of your day \"facilitating\". I'm phrasing this strongly not because I want to scare you away, but because I would like you to be aware of what you are walking into when you say yes. I chose to switch into the managerial track a while back and I must say I really enjoy it. If you have a tech background and can convince people of ideas you can really move the needle.That said, the \"cost\" is that you no longer get to play with any the cool toys yourself. You argue for better tech, fight for approvals, maybe participate in vendor negotiations, but once you get your hands on it you immediately give it to your engineers and they get to have all the fun. If you don't like the sound of that then maybe the managerial track is not (yet) for you :)Also, I had several conversations with people chasing manager positions because of salary. I wouldn't do that. You can get a VP-level paycheck as an architect or principal-level engineer if you are good. Heck, Tiktok Data/ML engineers can make up to $700k US a year so there is really no reason to become a manager just because you want a raise. Also, those people make shit managers (I worked underneath one for a few months).Final comment in the wall of text: Make sure that your promotion is not booting out your current manager. Replacing someone on parental leave will give you a bad rep and your rep will become much important than it is now.",

        "body": "Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks. I think they start their first cohort this semester.Feel free to ask any questions, I’m happy to answer where I can.",

Data engineering is very very rarely an entry level position. The two most common routes are: 1. Experienced software engineer gets experience with backend data systems and becomes a data engineer. 2. An analyst on the business side learns python and SQL to automate workflows, gets good at modeling data, and gets an \"in\" on the DE team when something opens up. My manager tends to hire type one as consultants and contractors that come and go. She hires type 2 as full time employees that stick around. So my advice is to pick a degree that sets you on one of those paths. Maybe it's terrible advice, maybe mediocre, maybe fantastic. I don't know.",

Now I personally was leaning into a DE major because I thought it would help combine data science/statistics with more computer science topics like databases/cloud computing. However, as you mentioned with DE not providing a solid cloud computing foundation, do you think it would be sufficient to add CS cloud computing electives. I have majority of the core curriculum taken away with AP classes which leaves decent spots for me to fill up? Also, you mentioned data engineering not being an entry level role. My original thought was by committing to a data engineering major I would be better suited to building infrastructure/data pipelines, but if that’s not an entry level role where does that leave me in the job market? I thought by having a DE major I wouldn’t necessarily have to compete with CS majors for similar jobs, giving me an edge. I apologize if these questions sound dumb, but I am trying to get the inner workings of exactly how this all fits in. Online sources are quite contradictory/weird and I don’t really have specific people to ask.",

As part of our CI/CD pipeline each data product registers itself using an Api Gateway endpoint so all services are fully autonomous and independent as far development goes (ofc thanks to dagster, the full lineage chart of source dependencies is easily accessible on ui). As for storage we use Iceberg tables on S3, and Athena as SQL engine. Data are finally loaded onto Power BI, where SQL monkeys can do all the damages they want.Your S3 and Athena costs are most likely due to bad queries, bad partitioning strategy, no lifecycle on athena s3 bucket, or any combination of the previous. Given that analysts have access to Athena, the first one is very likely.You can spin a RDS instance and load data in there as final step of your pipelines.

Like calculate daily counts that get used to calculate monthly numbers?Also, when it comes to costs - can you look at your AWS account and try to understand what is the main driver of that increase?",

You can spend a ton of time trying things, but in the end, just keep things simple. Also, while many tools above are open source, don't fall into the trap of setting up everything yourself.

It sounds like it started out small and grew with appendages where it's now a behemoth Frankenstein.Honestly, the data pipeline tooling gets better as soon as you step outside of trying to leverage only AWS native services. Airflow is nice but can carry a lot of infrastructure overhead. If you and your team are not interested in spending time on managing infrastructure, patching, etc. I would go for Prefect. We tried Airflow and it was way too time consuming to set it up and manage. Perfect was extremely simple and just worked. The underlying approach of the two is still the same.Go Databricks if you are looking to stay very close to your AWS account. Check out Snowflake on AWS in the same region your current AWS Org/Account if you're looking for greater flexibility in the future. Both are roughly the same cost.If you're analysts are well versed in SQL then Databricks or Snowflake are great solutions. If they are not SQL experts check out analytics platforms like Sigma that natively leverage the strengths of cloud data warehouses. We use Sigma and it's a great analytics tool first and foremost. It also does reporting and dashboarding.",

        "body": "One way to handle this data is like this:Start with your first full dataset, probably in CSV or Parquet format, and load it into a database table. When you do this, add two extra columns: start_date and end_date. Set the start_date to the day you ran the first scraping job (let's call it D), and set the end_date to something far in the future (like the year 9999) to indicate it's still \"active.\"Now, when you run your second scraping job (on day D+1), compare it to the data already in the table:* If a listing is new (wasn't in the first file): insert it as a new row, with start_date = D+1 and end_date = 9999.* If a listing no longer appears: update the existing row in the table to set its end_date = D. This marks it as no longer active.* If a listing is still there but has changed (e.g., price or details): treat it like a delete and reinsert. That means: Update the existing row's end_date = D, AND Insert a new row with the updated values, start_date = D+1, and end_date = 9999.If you already have a historical mass of scraped data, you keep going day by day until your current date. You then schedule your job to run right after the scraper to update the table with your new data.If this sounds confusing, look up Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) It’s a standard data warehousing method for tracking changes over time. The advantage is that you can use those columns you added to answer your questions.",

Then define a structure that aligns with your goals for analysis/downstream processing. It is usually good practice to not have transformation/normalisation and database update from the scraping process directly, although for small projects; do whatever ofc if reliability and reproducibility is not critical... For slowly (and sometimes platform dependent) changing IDs, you need an entity recognition process. There are multiple ways to achieve this, but you can often end up in a n^2 problem of comparisons. This is often dealt with using blocking keys ( think zip code, property categories etc), this way you get smaller n^2 problems. You can in addition/or involve embeddings or fuzzy matching logic approaches on top to determine duplicates / narrow comparisons. Best of luck and have fun",

If you are on AWS for instance, you need to build a Powerbi gateway to talk to Azure where the dashboards and data will sit, so you are paying probably for a scaling cluster depending on your projected usage. Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible. If you do it by caching on the Azure side for performance, then it requires you to move all the potential data that people could use across to make it available. You could also use direct query, where it queries every time someone refreshes. You only pay for the same query compute once a day because Snowflake caches the results, but you still move the data to Azure every time. So it has an impact on your gold data architecture, how you develop your data products and the extent to which you have decentralized access to a variety of data. Personally after using Powerbi for about a year after migrating off another platform, I would pick a different one that plays nice with your cloud and is more accessible to the business at large.",

In my current project, we are using ADF for ingestion and orchestration. It works well, does the job, and we have fewer tools to maintain.

Incremental Airbyte syncs plus dbt’s stateful models keep data volumes down; full reloads should be the rare exception. Kestra can kick off a Snowflake task that flips the warehouse to Medium only for heavy transforms, then shrinks it back. Use resource monitors with hard fail at 80% of monthly budget and track spend with the Snowflake usage view piped back into PowerBI. For SharePoint pulls, land the files in cheap object storage first and stage into Snowflake external tables to avoid compute on every file read. After trying Fivetran and Matillion for finance data, DualEntry handled multi-entity consolidations without blowing up credit usage.

Which offers you to tie to various computes, should enable you to run a spark job on a defined rule set of transformation. Even if it was meant for Duckdb initially. (I could be wildly wrong here)As for designing tools. Earlier this year we were trying to design a schema that enabled data coming in from a variety of sources to be queries (pretty standard for a data warehouse). But 1. we had no tools to help with the design for this.2. make sure that the queries running on it would be efficient. The process was mostly just blind guessing and really subpar work honestly. But I was initially thinking of something that lets you visualize the attributes coming in from your sources at one end and the queries you'll need to execute on the other end. Which can help you shape your data in the warehouse maybe more optimally or atleast give you an idea of how well a query will run on the schema.",

One technical project manager I worked with was pursuing one, but he left before he finished it.The reality is CFA is an extremely difficult certification, each level has a sub 50% pass rate and the only reason you should pursue one is if you want to become a person who professionally is allowed to give investment advice or directly manage a portfolio.The technical problems we solve don’t require that intimate knowledge of investment vehicles and financial planning, so anyone hiring for technical positions would far value technical aptitude over whatever CFA would bring to the table. Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby. And I really found the work soul draining, you work to make rich people richer and have to wear a tie every day. People there drink heavily after work too. A 10 beer night after work was pretty normal every day. My liver definitely could not handle it today.",

We then implemented Keebo and saw another 20% savings, which I’m pretty sure most of it was them dynamically adjusting the suspend time on the warehouses. Most of that big saving though was we were using a warehouse that was way to big, and by sizing it down our refresh times are slight worse but it’s worth the cost improvement.",

It comes with GCP/Azure/AWS, the accounts are short lived but last I checked you could still spin up some pretty expensive products like GCP's Spanner, Redshift, etc. Another reason, if you do something \"stupid\" that would generate a massive bill. You only paid 35 bucks and it's in their sandbox. I think you're allowed 10ish cpu cores of raw ec2 instances at a time. When linux academy was bought by cloud guru the courses became a shell of what they were and became very heavily designed towards passing certifications so I can't vouch for any of the training that comes with it.

Pick one small goal (like replicating an ETL you’ve already built), and use your credits just for that. Document what you do—it’s great for your portfolio.* **Databricks Community Edition** is another solid option—it’s limited, but you can still get a feel for Spark + notebooks in a cloud environment.* **Mock cloud architecture projects**: Even if you can’t spin up real services, diagram out what you would build. Treat it like a case study: describe the data flow, tools you'd use, how you'd deploy and monitor it, etc. Interviewers love seeing your thinking.* **Volunteer work or open-source projects**: Some nonprofits or small data teams are happy to have help setting up basic pipelines.

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive. Recently started using Sigma computing - less pretty dashboards but I think way easier to use. But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails. I know the Google genai and openai APIs both have functionality to do this kind of workflow.Good luck",

The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. \"Because we've always had them\" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. Generate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future. These things stay around a long time.",

I.e. you run at a given point so many tasks in parallel that resources are maxxed out and don't clear quickly enough prior to scheduled tasks timing out. And you get into a cascade. Best process to debug this if you can be confident that functionally, your tasks work is to approach a production scenario from super simple testing. Run 10, 20, 30%... of your typical number of parallel tasks but just to a BashOperator echo. Scale percentage. Then move the executed task closer to prod settings and again, step up from 10% task load. Rinse and repeat, see where outages start to occur and as what % of total. You need to approach this systematically and only ever change 1 parameter in testing to be able to identify a root cause.EDIT: Otherwise check the operators you're using. For example, KubernetesPodOperator has a default start time out limit and that can easily be too short for your scenario.",

        "body": "Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!\". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps. Set a retention policy (e.g., 1 year hot, archive the rest) to balance auditability and your wallet.",

If an object has been retrieved in the last 30 days, it is a relevant data object and should be saved (unless weekly full backups are made).The challenge I see here is that metadata-driven pipelines are planned, which means that each system (meta, Google, company MySQL, other sources) will get one pipeline that has to be structured dynamically so that it works for every use case. So for incremental and full backups, do you think this is a maintainable idea to implement, or would it significantly complicate maintenance in the future?",

If everything arrives in your onelake as files, you can work with onelake triggers in different folders to start different pipelines, for example. Thus also separate folders for incremental and full. Another approach you could take is to have a static table that dictates what the orchestrator needs to do at every scheduled run. It is indeed good practice to make the pipeline as dynamic as possible, and itll make things easier, not more complicated. No one wants a pipeline with more than a dozen or so activities. I dont know if this has anwered your question?",

Our official SLA is 3 hrs but in reality we process the data in around an hour tops end-to-end. The input is approx 500 JSON files a minute, essentially a new version of each business object in each file, and the output is 280+ delta tables. We use only custom-built pyspark notebooks to accomplish this, no DLTs, with a combination of continuous batch job workflows and ADF-triggered readstream workflows that run for 24 hrs then time out using a query listener to recycle and restart during off-hours.The first crux of the data feed is to transform the incoming JSON into a collection of 280+ tabular and relational “bronze” tables. This first crux is the essential schema transformation from an object-oriented data view to an analytical and relational-database view of the data. No data contents are modified, only the schema representation.The second crux is the creation of a merge statement from the collection of “bronze” tabular tables to the final collection of “silver” tables. We have 6 workflows that run this second part with about 75 tasks for the big ones, 20 for the smaller ones, that all use a status table as a readstream to know when parsed, tabular data is ready to merge into the final silver tables. Each task is responsible for keeping one final silver table updated. Think of it as laminar data flow.Not sure this helps since you seem to be receiving tabular data from the start, but seemed like our situation might have enough commonalities to describe here.Good luck!",

That's really all that's required for dash boards, real-time searches and fast lookups etc. I'd imagine people would output a pre-processed table from a daily pipeline, ingest it into Warp, then query it throughout the day.",

For example, Warp is benefiting greatly from the OS caching disk data: \\- Cold reads (from disk) hit around 5GB/s \\- Warm reads (from cached pages) can hit 200GB/s+Curious how large you're thinking? If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \\~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).It's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes. I've tried to keep it small so it's cheap to run (I suspect a lot of cloud users are paying more than they need to for their small/mid data sizes).

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. And there's different philosophies of design (\"in memory\" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).Some (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).You're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot. One of my colleagues posted this recently: https://datamonkeysite.com/2025/07/21/does-a-single-node-python-notebook-scale/Single nodes have gotten very powerful. But then again, smalk workloads don't always stay small. Having room to grow is good too, as is not having it be \"works on my machine\".I work on a distributed, autoscaling OLAP database engine (Fabric Warehouse) that's capable of efficient single node execution, or scale out, depending on what the query needs. So I'm not necessarily convinced one really has to choose between small scale efficiency and being capable of going distributed. But at the same time, you've already got a huge project on your hands as it is. It's a very interesting space, with lots of hard problems and competition. Good luck!",

To me it sounds like maybe you should extract specific standardized information from each pdf to a database and then you can use it to filter information, for example, using an llm to detect and classify project locations, sizes, cost at the time, and other related information, include source document and page, and for all location questions this should be used as a kind of index, I guess an llm reading each document and creating a json, you would need a validation for the structure of the output so it is consistent for all.The same for other subjects like names of people, locations (you can use a NER model like Stanza), tables, photos, designs, and so on, with this in place, maybe it is easier to identify which parts of each document has the information needed to answer a question and can be pdf raw fed to, for example, a Gemini query to answer the question or to simply used the gathered information in the database to answer. I am not sure that using pdfs and a chatbot is the best aproach for this though, seems to me that there should be a primary source of all that information and it should be collected and written in a database, and maybe some of these questions are some dashboards that should be built, but I don't have enough information of your context.",

This makes version control and CI/CD working harder as it's less precise/granular. They have an abandoned Git repository with a few months worth of commits with only the commit message to explain what part of the package was changed.Deploying each of those SQL statements as a SQL Mesh model will automatically provide dependency and lineage data plus make version control and CI/CD more natural.I think...

This way, all the events from before you identified the customer can be attributed to that customer.Look up identity resolution or identity stitching to read more about it. I would keep all transactions in the same table, just have user ID or whatever as null when it’s missing.

If you were doing fuzzy matching on names, you might be able to match Jon Smith to John Smith if the addresses were matching too.You may need a specialised identity/entity resolution system to do this.

Not knowing how to do something causes a lot of novices to freeze up and panic, but for a programmer, every problem always starts with \"I don't know how to do this.\" Programming is about where to go from that common starting point.

        "body": "What is it that people generally struggle with? It took me about a month (full time) to go from understanding practically nothing about programming, to being a passably competent junior developer, back around 10 years ago.I did spend a lot of my teen years building and tinkering with computers, and I was able to make static websites, but that was all I knew going into it. Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.I knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.I wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.I looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.Then I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.After that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.Honestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. I know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.I’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!If someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!As for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.I do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. If I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time. The same is true here, if you have an IDE installed, and have a web browser and a list of keywords, you can build an app, it might crash, or be slow, but you can build it, then you go again and you’ll do it better and faster next time.",

I’m hearing more and more from career services and from friends in the field that these kids are getting fired, if they are even getting jobs at all. I know the peer pressure must be immense, but keep away from that shit. At least while you are learning. Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt. If you are so dependent on a tool, that you cannot do anything without it, and you cannot problem solve or think for yourself, then why is someone going to hire you. What value do you bring. What education did you acquire. So longer answer yes. Your classmates are cooked.",

        "body": "If AI can write code, it can run a company.If there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.Currently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.The issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.There's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.So it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because \"AI could do their job.\" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.These companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.A lot of these companies were also \"benching\" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.Realistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.Meanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.If an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.That said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.I think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.When AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.You may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.Advances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.Realistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.My theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.My recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot. It will probably be easier for you to get a job.",

But I have some great connections in these community banks that will help us to approach them quickly at least in an entire city .Need guidance from some of the experienced people .The indian community bank market is growing, there is a very big market . We know the problems and issues they are facing and as those problems are modern we require modern solutions (and we have the solution)but most of the employees in this kind of bank are the retired corporate employees or either providing free community service after their occupational work and that's why they are trying to solve the issue with traditional ways or just trying to cop-up their work with the issue but they are not able to solve those issues completely .I can share my progress on the app , the issue , the solution everything.

        "body": "> So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. It's a bit more nuanced, but lets say this is kind of true.In any case, at the lowest level that is worth talking about, it's possible to connect some wires to the CPU/microcontroller and directly influence the electricty. But usually people don't do that, because both the computer/environment and the programming part have multiple levels of abstraction.First: The computer has \"firmware\" built in, which is basically small existing software that is part of the hardware components. One of its features is also that, when you turn the computer on, it loads other software from some predefined place (ie. the 0/1, or rather 0-255, that are stored there), and continues with executing this - so that you don't need additional physical wires to control your computer. This other software, that is loaded, can be called operating system (OS). And the OS then also doesn't do \"everything\" with 0/1 directly, but can give some known commands to the firmware (that the firmware understands).This data that is the operating system, you could create the 0/1 manually. But again people don't really do this. There is \"assembly\", which is a very basic, hardware-dependent programming language. There are commands like eg. MOV and PHMINPOSUW, no convenient loops, classes or anything like that. A helper program called assembler translates such a program to the binary data that can be executed.And, for both manual-binary or assembled programs, there's also the question of the environment that it runs in. Should it be an operating system that works directly with the hardware/firmware? Or should it run \"within\" an existing operating system, where it doesn't get to access the hardware anymore, but can access things provided by the OS?As next level, languages like C/C++/COBOL/Rust/.... Here you get compilers that translate this programming language into assembly. These languages are less hardware-dependent, instead you get different compilers for different hardware platforms (producing assembly for their specific platform). Once again, it's important to decide if you want to make an OS, or a program to run on an existing OS like Windows or Linux. The code will be quite different. As you know C, you surely know things like printf - that's not something the hardware and assembly can do, it's part of an existing OS (and it's libraries). When writing C to make an OS, you have to make your own printf too, by using firmware things that allow you to contorl the screens output.ObjC etc. are not C, please don't confuse them.Next level are languages like Kotlin, as you expected. With Kotlin, Java, C# and so on, there is no compiler that directly produces assembly anymore. It's technically possible to create such a thing, but no one is doing it. Compiling to C code is possible too, but again unusual. Instead they have their own compiled program format, that is unrelated to what the hardware can understand. And in addition to the compiler, they need a second helper program (written in C etc.), that during each execution takes this custom binary format and each time \"translates\" it to real native things on the fly. It might sound weird, but there are advantages too (and disadvantages too).",

Sometimes you need to use an existing language like C/C++ to write the first compiler for a new language and then you can use that first compiler to compile a compiler written in the new language. This is known as bootstrapping.Keep in mind that some languages are ahead-of-time compiled directly to machine language.

When you have a problem, search for your answer on docs or stackoverflow/forums and find the answer yourself. You will learn so much more this way, and have a deeper understanding. Sometimes, if you don't know what to search, AI can be useful to help you put a name to your problem, and then you can search based on that. Knowledge is valuable. Don't offload your learning! \\- To form a deep understanding, there's no substitute for hours working on projects. Just keep doing it. If you find somebody you can team up with, even better! Maybe there's an open source project you can contribute to, or something you can start. Collaborating with others is a great way to keep things fun, and gain valuable feedback on your code.\\- Don't give up! Technology is a competitive field. But if you enjoy the work and are excited to do it, you will succeed. You just have to care and try. You'll get there!If you need feedback on projects, ask. Many people are always happy to lend a helping hand, myself included!",

I don't say this just to be contrarian, but because this comparison leads to what I think is actually quite bad advice right here in this post. With spoken languages, yes, focusing on precision is a bad idea because they're usually vast, highly contextual, meaning is frequently ambiguous and it can be achieved through other means. For example, in a great many languages a question can be achieved either through the structure of a sentence. \"Am I going\" vs \"I am going\" but it can also be achieved through tone. \"I am going.\" vs \"I am going?\". We talk in language learning about something called tolerance for ambiguity, learning to accept speaking and listening without fully understanding everything, because the scale of what you need learn is vast and you're trying to actively fire up a part of your brain that will start working on what currently sounds like gibberish and start building meaning out of it. Programming *isn't like this* and, I think, one of the major mistakes learners make is thinking it is, or should be. You are correct that in programming you don't need to know everything, or understand everything. Limiting your toolset is, in fact, a strength, but you do actually have to know the pieces you're using well enough to put each after the other in a purposeful way because there is no other party trying to infer your meaning in good faith. There is only the ruthless obedience of the computer.",

Also, quite often more code will deal with scenarios that are not the actual, desired operation and its steps (often called happy path), but everything that can go wrong in the process or when optimistic assumptions are not met.However, not to sway anyone with this - a lot of recurring complexity is abstracted either within the language itself (or its more advanced components) or with libraries. It may not be as good or straightforward as you might expect, but with some proper tool selection and experience, it's not nearly as bad as you might worry it is.",

There's only so much you can do through a screen, unless you tie it to external assets/processes. Everything is a button. It's almost always CRUD (create, read, update, delete).Everything has already been done, that's not the point. Try to think up something useful, you think people need, and program that (even if it's a small resource, or blog).**EDIT:** For me, I mostly build websites for small businesses (which I really enjoy), and I enjoy programming (somewhat obsessively), so those are my motivations.

Someone made a wooden wheel, then someone else took that wheel, made it metal, then someone else developed a tire. Everything can be incremented on to be made better.

I don't think I heard people talking about \"coding\" until 2005 or thereafter.There are some colloquialisms and vocabulary that only work with the word \"code\". For example, we often say as programmers \"let me code this up\" meaning something like \"let me write a quick and dirty program for this\", or \"code autocomplete\" which means \"let the computer predict the next likely thing that you want to write\".",

The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a \"put to\" operator, looks like this: cerr << \"x = \" << x << \"\\n\";> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.So basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.In modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",

And rely on checking var type at runtime - can’t do in c/c++. Java uses weird trick with + which suddenly calls toString() behind curtains. How is that reasonable - it’s the only implicit thing in Java. At least in first versions. Python secretly calls `_repr_` but Python does many strange things. Also, notice how Python moved from print with commas separating args (and ugly way of controlling formatting with `sep=` to variable interpolation with `{}`. C++ found a pretty clean way to do it using operators. And it’s more reasonable to put `cout <<` at the beginning.

        "body": "It's definitely a shift when you go from an intro programming tutorial where you to have a sequence of things to learn to building a project where you learn as you go. I'll give an example:My first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a \"main\" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.So you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.If you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python. (If you want to stick to Javascript, there's NodeJS on the backend, but I've never used it myself.) You could also do something that's pure frontend but still fairly involved like making a single-player game.",

        "body": "I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\\- I would center my approach around the concept of \"how computers work and how to think systematically\". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around \"how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?\" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be \"How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't \"programming\" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to \"Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps\". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \\- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \\*argv\\[\\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(\"Hello World\");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \\- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(\"Hello World\"), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",

It seems like the only rigorous material you could cover with forty class minutes (30-35 in practice) in a week and no homework would be a bit of lecture and regurgitate. Would that have much value? Do you know of similar high school programs that have similar goals and similar limitations? (This isn’t a real school, is it? It’s an after-school cram school for kids in China?). Your goal is to invent something fun, that will engage kids who’ve already spent all day at school, but have some learning value? Maybe a puzzle game or competition that’s based in procedural logic? Something to develop their intuition about sequence, decision, and iteration?",

        "body": ">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a \"mental block\", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of \"my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on\" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. \"It's better to stop trying than to risk failure\", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that \"I don't get it\" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think \"how do I avoid this?\" but it's more productive to instead think \"how do I process this and learn from it?\" - because it is gonna keep happening.When your brain wants to say \"I don't get it\", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning. What tool can I use to get past this obstacle? How have I managed these situations before? Am I hammering my forehead against a wall here; and if so, can I change strategy rather than getting more upset it isn't working?",

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc. Figuring it out yourself is ALWAYS better than following a tutorial.",

They mostly just care about what your prior experience is. That being said, it's not impossible and is something I'm going to continue to look into.

Then you'll need to learn Android, which is the framework used to build Android apps. You would use Android Studio as your IDE.If you want to deploy on both iOS and Android, you have a few options:1. Learn Swift, SwiftUI/UIKit, Kotlin, and Android. Build two separate apps, one for iOS and one for Android.2. Learn JavaScript (language) and React Native (framework) and build one app that will run on both iOS and Android.3. Learn Dart (language) and Flutter (framework) and build one app that will run on both iOS and Android.Native apps (meaning, not React Native or Flutter) are almost always better in terms of appearance and performance, but many popular apps use React Native or Flutter, so they're not bad options.If you go with option #2 and learn JavaScript, you will also have a head start on web development (building websites), so it's not a bad idea for a beginner.Either way, you'll have a lot to learn. How you learn is up to you. Most beginners would probably benefit from first learning the language using a college textbook, and then buying a book that walks you through making an entire iOS, Android, React Native, or Flutter app, so you have guidance and a working example to build off of.

May or may not work, and won't work well if it does, but you might be able to get a prototype you can show off.2. If it is a straightforward but not dead simple app that needs to work well, you need to start at the beginning, build up fundamentals, and get yourself to the point of knowing what you need to know even. Start with a intro computer science course - there are lots available online for free, like Harvard's CS50. Once you've got a few hundred hours of learning the basics down, then you can start asking some more app development specific questions. Expect to spend thousands of hours learning before you can make something decent. 3. If the app isn't dead simple and you don't have thousands of hours to learn app development, hire someone.",

        "body": "Whoa there's a lot to be said here. But I'm in a somewhat similar situation at the moment and quite burned out, so I'll try to cover all the important stuff:1. Whatever you want to do (career change, learn new stuff, etc), ensure you have a way to sustain yourself. In this case, \"sustain yourself\" could mean leaving your current job and living off savings for a while... Enumerate your options and pick any option that works for you. There may be multiple correct answers and multiple wrong answers1. Using one extreme case as an example: let's suppose you choose to stay at your current job and try to learn new things in parallel (this is more or less your current situation). Realize that your bandwidth is limited and the more burned out you are, the faster you will subsequently burn out if you don't let up on the pressure. 1. Learning while on the job: if you are able to draw a connection between your current job and programming, you might be able to pitch it as a professional development exercise to gain employer support1. I recently read [an article about Amazon employees reading 1-4h every day][amazon-reading]. Maybe there's something to it and your daily reading could be programming1. Learning programming is less about reading and more about fiddling/tinkering. At least for me, the learning correlated more with practice than reading earlier on. Later in my practice, I was able to learn more from reading than I was previously able to, but tinkering (trying out new ideas that I've read about) has always been part of my learning loop.1. it sounds like consistently finding bandwidth is an issue. Consider that your learning journey could be slow and bursty. So read about a small topic today and practice it for 10min. Practice it again tomorrow for 10min. Maybe you'll have more bandwidth day after, so practice it for 25min. The following week, start the next topic. In this example, I mean \"topic\" to be something as simple/small/atomic as list slicing. Adopting this strategy will keep you within your available bandwidth (and thus avoid/mitigate burnout), but it is slower than (for example) a bootcamp or a structured course.1. Eventually (on like a long weekend or something), try building a side project. Once you start down this path, two things happen: (1) you'll start trying to apply all new concepts to your project and (2) your project becomes your guiding light for what to learn next. This second thing is a super powerful driving force in helping you learn new and useful things.1. Remember always to listen to your burnout meter. You can't learn if you're burned out. It's counterintuitive and difficult to implement, but if you're feeling the early stages of burnout, STOP. Write out your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of paper... or record yourself on TikTok; find a way to externalizing your ideas so that you're not constantly ruminating over them when your brain is asking for a break (I used a notebook and a pen... I guess I'm old school like that).I'll stop for now (my brain needs a break), but feel free to ask followup questions and I'll be happy to answer to the best of my ability[amazon-reading]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/former-amazon-principal-engineer-says-he-spent-1-4-hours-reading-daily-and-it-s-part-of-the-company-s-secret-sauce/ar-AA1Iw4QO",

Immediately disable those secrets so they provide no access to any of your services.For the people who believe GitHub trains on your private repositories:GitHub's [privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement?utm_source=chatgpt.com#private-repositories-github-access) explicitly says:> If your GitHub account has private repositories, you control the access to that information. GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:> - security purposes> - automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service> - to assist the repository owner with a support matter> - to maintain the integrity of the Services, or> - to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.> GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.And there's no mention anywhere else in the privacy statement about them training Copilot on your private repositories. So unless you believe one of the most valuable companies in the world (Microsoft) is outright lying in their privacy statement, then you can not worry about this possibility.Legal policies can't play games like assuming everyone knows Copilot training on private data is part of \"the integrity of the Services\" - they have to be explicit.If you think they are outright lying or twisting words, then I guess you should immediately stop using any Microsoft products, and consider any information you've ever entered to be public.Similarly, GitHub once mentioned that \"no human eyes\" will ever see the code from your private repositories. A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games. Your private repositories are reviewed by some kind of machine, because that's how GitHub indexes your repositories for you! That way you can search for keywords and symbols, and so on. How else would they do that?Ultimately: your code isn't worth the risk to Microsoft. There are already hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of public repositories for them to use.",

The prep you do should be focused on refreshing your existing knowledge, not trying to suddenly guess what they might want and cram something new. You want to be confident about what you know, and know well. If you don't know .NET well enough for this job now, you won't learn enough in a week, and you risk picking up some shallow knowledge that you can't back up which will make you look like you're bluffing. You're applying for a junior position, that *should* mean they're not looking for direct working experience. They want to know that you can code, that you aren't lost as soon as you're pushed on something, and that you'll be able to do the *kinds* of work they do if not the specifics. If they set you a technical challenge of some kind, just don't overthink it. Break it down to its simplest form and write it one step at a time. At the end of the day, being able to explain what you're trying to do and why is often more important than succeeding at the challenge. They want to know you can be taught, not that you know everything already.",

The way you tackle a problem is very similar if not the same. The languages just give you a couple of different tools to do it but in my experience, my strategy for tackling a problem would be similar whether I did it in Java or C#.One thing I'd offer as advice is that if you're asked to solve a problem and you get stuck, think out loud. Tell them what you know, what you think you know, what you're trying to figure out, etc. It's easier for them to evaluate if they know what you're trying to figure out and they might even ask you some questions that might trigger something to help you solve the problem. You're not expected to know everything but if they feel that you're teachable then you might be what they're looking for.",

However, C# can be used in game engines like Unity.Saying it's the \"best\" for game design is hard to prove. There are many choices that are arguably better, depending on your goals. That said, it's a good language to learn if game design is your ultimate goal.As for tips:- Don't use AI.- If you use AI anyway, don't ask it to generate code and paste it in without understanding what it does.- Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Just try things.- I wouldn't jump straight into game dev. Try to get a basic understanding of the language with console apps or Windows Forms first.C# is a \"typed\" programming language. Every variable you define has a \"type.\" IE: ints are numbers, strings are text, chars are letters. You can use or define more complex types. For example, you could have a variable called \"player\" with a complex structure to represent the player's position, velocity, health, etc.C# is a \"managed\" programming language. You don't have to worry about directly allocating memory, or cleanly exiting your app— that's all handled for you.",

But it also depends on your country, it's not the same everywhere.If you really want to be a computer science engineer or work in cybersecurity, depending on how things are in your country, you're probably going to have to put in a significant amount of work in your resume and may need to apply to quite a few jobs just to get one.It's harder to land a profession today than it is to land working at a restaurant or retail store.If I could give you my \"best recipe for life\" suggestion, it would be to work in real life, and do programming as a hobby. A lot of peoples' egos go \"ewww, labor! but i want to go above and beyond\", but they end up overworking themselves and realizing that office work wasn't as great or as fun as they thought.As a hobby programmer, I've made a couple very helpful open source projects, and a lot of fun stuff involving mods for video games. I've also created a few of my own games myself, including both using game engines, and without game engines in pure programming languages.It can be a very fun creative outlet, and when you don't have time pressure behind your back, the problems you encounter can be *fun* instead of annoying; like interesting puzzles to solve.So, programming as a hobby, as long as you don't do it too much, can make for a healthy balanced life and even give you a creative outlet you didn't think of before. Programming as a *profession* you are not guaranteed to land even if you try, and even if you do land it, you might realize it isn't actually enjoyable in the long run.>ill be studying animation in polytechnic in MalaysiaI've taken some classes in animation before. I took it for fun, while most of the others in my class were taking it for career prospects. Animation is a fun hobby, especially making fun little lego animations, flipbooks, etc. But once you start getting serious with it, or taking professional courses, at least in my country, then it gets a lot harder.I've also heard from animators on the internet that their job is a struggle, that AI is concerning them about displacement, and that they're having difficulty whether they're YouTubers or employees at a company.Just google \"is animation very competitive\" and you'll find search results.",

For this reason, I'd suggest learning TypeScript as a programming language and using either Electron or Tauri for the user interface. TypeScript is a pretty good language. It's not the fastest or the most reliable or the one that supports most experimenting, but it's distinctly above average on most criteria. You'll have to pair this with either vanilla HTML or a front-end framework, which will increase the learning curve, sadly.Electron and Tauri are convenient ways to ship desktop (and mobile) applications written in TypeScript (or JavaScript) that will work on all operating systems.",

I offered my scripting knowledge and we figured something out that did all of the work in a few seconds - for a task estimated to take many weeks of man hours.But bosses can be resistant to change or stubborn or complacent with how things are.

The encoding UTF-8 has variable lengths, and some of them are 4 byte long.- Unicode is much, _MUCH_ more than just the assigned characters. For each character you also must support all the properties, case foldings, categories, NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD, different collations, sortings, glyphs etc..

The first, at U+1E7E7 is in keeping with the Ethiopic encoding principle in the Unicode Standard whereby eight positions are allocated per syllabic family. Most, but not all, syllabic families will have a member occupying the eighth position. Past experience found that the eight position may later be populated when a corresponding syllable is found in a language when it begins using Ethiopic script for its orthography. Accordingly, U+1E7E7 may later be populated with a HHYWA or HHYOA syllable if its availability is later found to be required by another language. The remaining unassigned positions, U+1E7EC, U+1E7EF, and U+1E7FF have correspondence with syllables still in use from the prior orthography that might have otherwise occupied these syllabic and code positions (U+1380, U+1383, and U+138F accordingly).",

This is an important rule because you don't want the code point U+0045 to mean the letter E in Unicode Version 3, but the letter W in Unicode Version 4. Code point reassignments would invalidate all earlier documents.If you accept this rule, then the following three desirable properties are incompatible:1. Related code points are grouped together in sets.2. Sets can gain characters in future versions.3. All assigned code points are contiguous beginning at 0.If you break rule 1, then you lose sets.If you break rule 2, then it means that if you need to add a related code point, you have to start a new set (which will probably have just that one code point in it). This basically makes sets pointlessSets are useful because they let you check things like \"Does this code point require a font that supports Cyrillic?\" more conveniently, as well as allowing those checks to continue working even when a new version of Unicode is released. Any new Cyrillic characters will take a previously-unassigned spot in a Cyrillic set. You need to update your code only if a new relevant set is defined, like \"Cyrillic Extended-B\".Sets are also useful for parallel development. If Team A is working on a new Cyrillic character, and Team 1 is working on a new Ethiopian character, they can each choose an unassigned code point from their respective sets and start writing documents with it to see how well it works. If you didn't have sets, then maybe Team A gets unofficial number N and Team 1 gets unofficial number N+1. But Team 1 gets their code point approved first, so now they have official number N, and this disrupts both Team A and Team 1 as they both have to go back and re-encode all their documents. (And we don't like re-encoding documents. See first paragraph.)Rule 3 isn't important. You shouldn't be rejecting unassigned code points anyway (except perhaps for those marked as \"permanently unassigned\"). The Unicode Standard has recommendations for [Unassigned Characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99191.htm), namely, to treat them as generic characters with default properties. This allows your code to continue working when previously-unassigned code points become assigned.So the question is based on a false assumption: That it's important to be able to reject unassigned code points.You don't want your program to reject a person's name because it uses a newly-assigned CJK character, or to reject a product description because it uses the newly-assigned Rupee symbol *₹*.",

We have to do more work (all of us) and have code that runs a bit slower (it won't be noticeable but still, annoying) in the case that they might need to extended.

You will eventually want to learn HTML and CSS, as well as Tailwind and how to build component libraries, since you're into UX.After you learn HTML and CSS, turn your attention to learning Django, which is an opinionated web framework for Python. Opinionated is a good thing, especially when you're new to web development, because it will teach you best practices.Eventually, you'll want to learn JavaScript and a front-end framework like React, but you can do a lot with just HTML, CSS, Python, and Django.Enjoy!PS: If you do decide to learn HTML and CSS, here are a couple of links that you can finish within a week and will teach you all you really need to know before jumping into Django.1Learn HTML: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) 2Learn CSS: [https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-css](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-css) 3Learn CSS Flexbox: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css-flexbox-and-grid](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css-flexbox-and-grid)And for good measure, here is a link to the Django tutorial from the official documentation:[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/)",

Also as mentioned by other comments manually synchronizing the changes to 'Fruit' and 'fruitColor' is pretty error-prone.If you absolutly want to use an enum for this I recommend something like this instead (Java example) enum Fruit { ORANGE, APPLE, BANANA } String fruitColor(Fruit fruit) { return switch (fruit) { case ORANGE -> \"orange\"; case APPLE -> \"red\"; case BANANA -> \"yellow\"; }; }Or like this (assuming GDScript permits enum methods) enum Fruit { ORANGE(\"orange\"), APPLE(\"red\"), BANANA(\"yellow\") final String color; Fruit(String color) { this.color = color; } String fruitColor() { return color; } } String fruitColor(Fruit fruit) { return fruit.fruitColor(); }",

        "body": "While in this situation there’s not much difference, each has very specific use cases. Enums are generally used as like a switch… lets say you had something with three different states, Running, Idling, or Off. While you could store this as a dictionary or array, this is what Enums are built for. They are a very simple data structure. Arrays are best for lists. Most languages support adding new items to your array, removing items from your array and have support for doing something to every item in an array. While in this case, you have an array of strings, commonly the elements within the array are more complex. Consider storing a list of books… you will want an author, a book name, a genre, for each item in the list. Enums can’t do this, and while a dictionary could, there are some drawbacks to using a dictionary in this way. Dictionaries are great for things like your actual book object. They have constant time access, so it’s easy to store a value and look up a value in this way. You can also assign more complex values to dictionaries, not just strings, which makes them better for anything more complex than an enum. They however are not the easiest to iterate through, and adding values requires you to also have a key to store the value to. For most languages, the keys are not ordered either, which is why for a changing list an array is better. Hope that helps!",

        "body": "*Note: I don't know about the specifics of GDScript, so this is a generic answer that should apply to all languages.*The only practical difference between the two versions is that enums uses simple numeric indexes, and dict uses strings (or any other kind of objects) as keys. Enums are technically faster, but that rarely matters.What is a huge difference though, is the errors you might get when compiling and the help your editor gives you in avoiding those errors.If you tried this with the enum version: print(fruitColor[Fruit.PEACH])you would get an error telling you that PEACH isn't defined, and you'd probably discover it early when trying to write PEACH, and autocomplete didn't help at all!But if you tried this similar thing with the dict version: print(fruitToColourDict[\"peach\"])you would get a print or NULL or Undefined, or nothing, depending on the exact language used. You probably wouldn't be told that \"peach\" did not exist in the dict, and you also wouldn't get any hints from the autocompletion while writing it, that it might be wrong. Enums aren't just \"lists of words\", they should be considered more like a custom variable-type, like a boolean that can be `true` or `false`, you can create your own types, like a return value that can be `true`, `false` or `fileNotFound`. They are extremely useful when writing code, because you always know that you only use values that the rest of the program will expect.Dicts on the other hand, are used more when you don't know all the possible values when writing the program - and you might want the program itself to add more keys to the list of known values.",

You can't add to them or remove from them.For Dict vs array, if you want to find something in an array you need to loop through it and compare.This is slow, especially on a hot path (something that is called often, e.g. in a loop)You won't see much of a difference in simple code that doesn't do much, or with small arrays, but as you get into thousands of objects, using a dictionary to store a reference to something that is not an index will be far faster than an array search.As always, it depends on what you have and what you want to do.",

If you're able to handle yourself during an interview, your chances grow dramatically. You don't need to know all the answers, but it's important to communicate honestly about what you know and don't, and to seem like a good addition to the team. It's a very good idea to, for example, instead of saying \"I don't know.\" say \"I'm not that familiar with this right now, but I'm actually very interested to find out more about it first thing on the project\" etc. Be able to say basic stuff about most reasonable areas during the interview, even if it seems trivial (like, if you've only heard a few words about contexts in react, do say it's a way to pass data between components, but you had no chance to use them yet and you're very interested to become more familiar with them the first chance you get). Don't expect to do too well during your first interview either. Don't sweat about any practical challenges either, I've been mostly interviewing senior engineers for the last couple of years and you'd never believe me how they generally struggle with relatively simple coding tasks. If you need some more help feel free to reach out, in some future I'm interested in potentially reaching out for help from some junior devs in Poland, so I'll save your post too.",

This is quite easy to hit, even if you don't have many concurrent users. Fortunately, this is easy to test as well — just make a test script to write recipes to the database, and then use your website — see if there any issues when pulling out a specific recipe, or searching through recipes.The next \"10k\" limit you'll reach is 10k regular users. This is not too difficult; any scalable, modern, hosting provider — like Vercel — should be able to handle this with no issues. You'll simply want to check that you can afford whatever they are going to charge you, so this simply involves being familiar with their pricing structure.Finally, we come to what you said — \"10k concurrent users\". This is a *really* rare situation — this is going to be getting close to a really popular website on the Internet. At this point, there's no guidebook on a guaranteed, step-by-step way to handle this. You'll need to have a lot of logging in place, so that you have visibility into load times, and exactly *where* are the slowdowns. Once you know that, you can start figuring out solutions to speed up those specific slowdowns. However, it's important that you know *where* the slowdowns are first, because it's a bit waste of time to optimize something, only to find out that that wasn't the true slowdown.To test this, you can use one of the many load-testing software tools out there, once you have appropriate logging in place.",

Then add authentication to it, add database to it, etc.Every micro adjustment will give you experience to each area you want.Basic rule of thumb for each project:* Idea / problem it solves* Authentication* DatabaseDon’t worry about docker containerisation for now, first get some projects completed start from finish even tiny ones.

Yesterday I was looking into some errors with third party software. Tomorrow I'll be learning something else. That's the job. Or at least a large part of it. People think writing software is mainly typing. It is. If you're a programmer. If you're a software engineer then the job is research, learning, thinking, designing. Then 20 minutes of typing. Be a software engineer.As an aside. If you're trying to learn something like cancellation tokens then spend a few hours designing your own cancellation token. How would you do it if someone asked you to? It's actually not that hard. I mean it is, but the basics are fairly simple. Designing it to production level quality is significantly harder. But you don't need to do that to learn the raw basics.If I had a junior engineer who \"wasted\" a morning building their own basic cancellation system to learn how it works I would be impressed. And I'd give them the slightly more complex work to do and nudge them in the right direction. As a junior your current job is to learn. Not write software. You can write software once you've learned how. Part of that is writing software to gain experience. But all of the job is learning. You're not currently productive enough to be useful. You will be.

Means to an end? In the nicest way, don’t waste your time. Programming is a lifetime of learning new things and spending hours on not only creating new things, but finding tiny bugs in thousands of lines of code. If you’re not passionate about it, you will burn out and ultimately waste your time (and sometimes money if you join a bootcamp or something). It takes a ton of failing through an attempt to create projects where you’ll actually learn and make it into a useful skill.",

Let's look at his assertions**Learn this language and you're set for life**Python is popular and it will get you far, but much like learning a second (or third language), you gain a better appreciation of the first language and its quirks when you learn a second one. Most find the second language intolerable because it does things differently from the first, especially if the language is quite a bit different. If you went from C to C++, that's like learning more C. If you go from C# to Java, they will feel like similar languages. If you go from Python to Java, Java would likely seem way to verbose and too concerned with types.It's nice to know a few other languages, but for now, getting decent at Python is a good first step.**Learn Selenium**OK, that's out of left field. If you can't build a web page, learning Selenium seems advanced. It's often used to run automated steps on a browser, often for testing purposes. It's a little like learning to fix a car before you learn how to drive. I suppose it can be done, but it seems advanced.I wouldn't worry about Selenium for now.**Taking a Course**There is a free course here: https://programming-25.mooc.fi/This is a real college course and there are some quizzes and such. You don't get credit, but at least it's structured.You could also try: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/It's a little hard to set up initially, and I think it goes into non-standard topics at the end, but it's also good. It was developed by the folks at Harvard.You'd probably spend a year (or at least 6 months) learning to program half-decently. I think some feel they need a few years to feel somewhat comfortable. It does vary widely from person to person as some people find it easy to pick up (rare) or they just don't get it at all (rare). You seem like you're in the middle.Stuff to learn* Control flow (if, while, function calls)* File I/O* Functions* ClassesPython doesn't really force you to write your own functions or even classes, but it's good to learn them.Afterwards, you'd learn some basic data structures* Queues, stacks* Trees* Dictionaries* Graphs* Sorting algorithms* Binary search through a sorted arrayAs another person suggested Automate the Boring Stuff (free online) spends ten chapters going over Python, then has ten more chapters (or so), each devoted to one thing you could automate.

There's just a single fundamental technology at play (JS) and used in a similar way (web backend).

That's why courses like Odin Project are crucial, it should be one of the first things they teach you.There is the front end code - the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that gets sent to and parsed by the user's web browser.Then there's the back end code - the Python, C#, PHP, or whatever language you like running on a web server, that takes a browser's HTTP request, does stuff, then sends a response back to the browser (usually in the form of a web page or some dynamic data to render).You can't run Python code directly in a web browser, they don't understand it.GitHub Pages is designed for hosting documentation for your GitHub projects, as such it has limited capabilities. There is obviously a web server involved, but it only serves front end code (aka static content), it can't run custom Python code or a database or anything like that.Instead what you need is a web server that supports Python code. Probably using a Python-based web framework like Django. Or at least something that can run Python via CGI, a protocol that allows standard web servers like Apache or Nginx to call external runtimes. Very few companies are giving this kind of functionality away for free, it costs real money to maintain the infrastructure. You can run a web server from your own machine, but that has its own caveats.",

Sure the capabilities you have will land you the job. But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you. Don’t limit yourself to one stack though. Try to learn the basics for a few others so you know what you like best. For example Angular, Vue, etc.(My bias is for react and next.js though :squinting_face_with_tongue:)",

        "body": "I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation. I am not anti capitalist. I believe in markets. But capitalism only works when it is balanced. Capital should flow to where it creates value. When one player has too much it is like poker. They just buy every pot.",

California public schools ( I think it was the state university system) Paid by taxpayers, replacing American workers with non-American workers and rigging the system so that the American Taxpayers money wasn't given to American workers, in spite of some rules/laws that they were supposed to.I remember the Disney one went before the US House and they told about how their lives were turned upside down.Make no mistake about life: YOU ARE A TARGET.

Even a big successful private company either won't offer you any stock or the stock will be worthless without some kind of exit event that lets you cash out your options.Even for big public companies outside of FAANG, you're not likely to get much stock:[https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-eng](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-eng)Capital One: $150k for mid level[https://www.levels.fyi/companies/walmart/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l2](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/walmart/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l2)Walmart: $112k for L2One of those is going to be closer to the average salary for a developer with 2 years of experience in the US.

And then you’re looking at candidates working at some of the most profitable companies in the world. To get into these companies they’re doing 5-6 rounds of intense interviewing. To even get their resume looked at they are competing with thousands of other candidates many of whom are also from other FAANGS and top tier colleges.In America we can be fired for no reason at all without warning, so our salaries have to compensate for our potentially long and unexpected job searches. South America appears to have considerably more protections here.You also likely have public healthcare, low cost education, and/or pension plans, none of which we have (we have social security but it’s only for folks who worked and every election there’s talk of getting rid of it). So our salaries have to offset that and other basic social services that we lack. The market is horrible right now. Getting interviewed at one of these jobs without connections or a top tier degree is basically impossible. Partially because there are not nearly as many openings now as there used to be, partially because these jobs have always been somewhat like that. Even if you got the interview you’d need near perfect performance to pass as employment shortages mean they can be pickier. And after all of that most of the FAANG companies will be looking to heavily overwork you and then push you out or PIP you within under 3 years. I worked at Amazon, happens all the time.",

This means they have no memory of past bust cycles, and they're experiencing one for the first time now. Because they assumed the party would never end, they were extremely shocked in 2022 when the market suddenly reversed course and layoffs began.As for the people saying \"but this time is different because AI\", it's important to remember that \"this time is different\" every time.

But it's not. The upper execs and boards are still increasing their take home and ownership at or above the same rate. It's really a tear in the system. Something is very wrong - and no I don't believe it was due to 'over hiring' during covid. It's probably more-so that they have been sitting and have so much pride in their infrastructure/office-space, their ping pong tables, etc. where those buildings were a massive shit investment (hence enforced RTO), where they were absolutely hemorrhaging money for years. They own other office spaces they were renting out to smaller companies - which if you drive around and peek at those alt-office spaces, they're still dormant.

There are even periodic calls to ban or flair or otherwise discredit new grads or junior developers for being too pessimistic due to \"not having enough experience\", even though they are, by far, the largest part of the industry and the greatest indicator of it's health.Even today, anyone who dares complain about the state of the industry is often derided for being mediocre, told that \"there are no problem for goOd dEvelOpErs\" and fed other pointless misinformation. Most developers are somewhere around average. This average has risen a lot over the past ten years. If these people can't find jobs, the industry has a problem. It's really that simple.

        "body": "Congrats on spotting the burnout before it completely consumed you. A lot of people let it boil over and ditch the entire industry because of itFor future reference, there's a middle-ground between sacrificing your mental health and burning out, and quitting cold turkey: Establishing very clear professional boundaries, and sticking to them no matter what.I value my WLB very much, it's literally the most important thing to me about the team I'm working on. If I somehow ended up on a team that had a bad WLB, I'd start looking for another job. I know I won't change that teams culture, it is what it is.Instead of quitting though, I'd make my boundaries very, very, very crystal clear, and I would stick to them. I'm available 9-5. Hard stop. That's not negotiable. If I'm asked to do something at 5:30, I just won't respond. Or if things aren't terrible and I still have a decent relationship with that person, at most I'll give them a courtesy: \"OK, I'll take a look first thing tomorrow morning\". I don't care if deadlines get missed, not my problem, that's a planning problem. I don't care what insane committments my boss made. I work 9-5.Boundaries are what let you escape work mode. I don't work after 5pm, and I've taught my brain that same boundary, so it doesn't think about working after 5pm. If you lack that boundary, you can't escape \"work mode\" *because you're always working*. Your brain knows you're always working. You taught it that, why would it let you turn that mode off?In the same vein, sounds like your boss was an ass, but I also don't let feedback get to me. I do my best, 8 hours a day. If my best isn't good enough, not my problem. They hired me, that was their mistake, not mine. If my boss hates my guts, thinks I'm underperforming, or using AI? Tough. I'm not thinking about that after 5pm, and I'll just smile and nod during my 9-5, without changing a thing.The reason boundaries like this are so important, and so powerful is it lets you keep your mental sanity, even when you're at an aggresive, fast paced, toxic company.If these boundaries aren't acceptable for your employer, guess what happens? They fire you, and you're *exactly* where you just put yourself voluntarily anyways. But the hidden truth people aren't talking about is it can takes months, sometimes *years* before a company decides to pull the trigger on firing you over this kind of stuff. So you just bought yourself a whole lot of time to search for another job on the side, all while staying sane.Keep these things in mind for your net gig. Props to standing up for yourself, but at the same time remember there's usually a happy middle-ground hiding between the 2 extreme options of quitting vs burning out.",

I don't think that's a good idea for you. I think you need to take some time to disconnect, re-establish your sense of self and your humanity, and remember your worth as a person. We are so much more than a paycheck. And wayyyy more than just our jobs. Someone below mentioned establishing boundaries, and I do agree with that. In this case, you were working under an aggressive (and frankly unrealistic) timeline:\\- Boundary 1 is not putting all the blame on you. Super-tight timelines? Hmm...maybe you could do something more, or maybe your boss overpromised to his customer, or maybe you're incredibly understaffed and asking to do work that one person alone shouldn't be responsible handling. \\- Boundary 2 is knowing when to switch off work when you log off your computer. It shouldn't keep you up at night. We are not surgeons, where one wrong mistake means that someone dies. We write code to make products. Like...the world will be ok. And so will you.Last thing is that people don't quit jobs; they quit managers. Your boss lacks the emotional intelligence that I would expect from someone managing people.

Then I got into the interview and the hiring manager asked how I would interpret COBOL code if I needed to on the job. He also gave me a mini-system design exercise and asked if I would use a noSQL or SQL DB. But then he wanted me to drill down and give sample SQL queries. I don’t have any experience writing queries so I couldn’t answer that.I had another interview with a bank where the recruiter said it would be a call with the manager, and “maybe an engineer” would join, and it ended up being 2 engineers joining and doing a panel-style interview, which didn’t go well. Most recently, I had another interview interview for a test automation role, and I tried to ask the recruiter for more info about what the team did but she didn’t have any. I thought the role had to do with the tests that run in the CI/CD pipeline but it was a completely different world, I didn’t recognize any of the testing technologies the manager mentioned (because I never worked in testing) and it was awkward when he asked why I wanted to join that team when he hadn’t told me what the team did and neither did the recruiter.",

Your annual refresher is just at the L+1 band, so it can take a few years to reach middle of the total comp band.You could also clear the interview bar for L+1, be unprepared for it, and get managed out. Being close to promo at your current company usually means you are operating at L+1 though, which is why I think that’s ideal. I would only stay at Google if you see guaranteed promo toward L4 in next cycle, scope after that for L5, and strong support from your manager to get you on those projects. But without foresight it’s hard to beat a guaranteed level bump and band reset from a financial perspective imo w/ all other factors normalized.",

Modernizing these dinosaur companies in such a short timeline was a massive undertaking, made possible by near-zero interest rates and tax breaks on developer salaries. It created a tech hiring bubble.Many grads hired into FAANG during this time barely had a chance to gain real experience before being laid off. And what does that signal to recruiters? Fair or not, it suggests you were in the bottom performance tier and got cut. It’s rough but not necessarily your fault. You were supposed to have time to grow, learn, and move up or out. That chance was taken away.Now you're competing with other laid-off peers and fresh grads some of whom companies may prefer because they're seen as more malleable and come without the layoff baggage. And if you have under four years of experience, you're often not seen as experienced enough for mid-level roles, but no longer \"new\" enough for new grad positions either.",

You still couldn’t land anything, which is surprising. I’m not sure what happened back then, but you definitely could’ve gotten a basic office job.Did you join any student clubs or organizations? Did you go to your university’s career fairs? (most are open to alumni too.) What have you done besides sending out online applications? Have you been working on your technical skills in the three years since graduation?You might need to move to a different area where more in-person jobs are available. Just sending out resumes clearly isn’t working. Start getting involved, locally or online. Go to your university’s career services. Reach out to other CS grads from your school on LinkedIn.

Also where I live I see a number of jobs that barely get any applications in the areas of embedded systems, operating systems, and compilers. There’s even an assembly language programmer job at an insurance company with only 3 applications. So it’s not true every job gets a 100 applications in the first 10 minutes. Maybe every easy to do job does but there are jobs out there that barely get any apps. I’m getting my masters in SWE right now and the classes I am taking are not the popular ones like AI that gets 75 students for one class. I’m taking compiler design and operating systems this semester. I want to be able to apply for the jobs no one else can do. So the advice in summary would be to get involved in open source and identify jobs that dont get a lot of applications. They are out there!",

Things should just be done by one person’s arbitrary idea of common sense. But they will not communicate any if it. I’ve worked with terrible managers, analysts, QA, etc. The good ones are worth their weight in gold and make your life easier. Employees need to stand up for themselves and set boundaries, not just devs.",

You'll be hard pressed to communicate up and explain that these tools don't have the capacity to do what's advertised (they won't listen to you), so I suggest you instead explain in terms of metrics how extensive use of AI impacts productivity and output (because it's always going to be a net negative in large orgs), or, alternatively, ask questions to the managers on how they're future proofing their own career from AI, since I'd much rather have an LLM manage my sprint board and translate product requirements from the business than have an LLM write code for me.",

For now, I don’t see AI agents performing well with large and complex codebases or the economics of tokens/infra being sustainable, but the problem is that non technical stakeholders are the first to jump in to the possibility of reducing the technical workforce to save money. A few of them referred to data engineers as “code monkeys” that only push code. They clearly do not understand the roles of technical staff which is why agents are doomed to begin with. Unfortunately, us technical people are in their eyes a liability and not an asset. AI is not the problem, non technical management is",

TheSo learn how to use AI more effectively for development so you have less debugging to do. Try practice using Cursor or Claude Code.Software development will inevitably change. It's the very nature of the work. This is a field that is constantly changing so you should always be learning. The historical trend is that programming becomes ever more human-readable. Programmers used to punch holes on a paper to write a program to feed it into a computer. And then UNIVAC and magnetic tape came along until punch cards were eventually entirely replaced. And now we have Python, one of the most human-readable languages out there.I believe programming is going through a similar paradigm. This is a good thing, as programming workflow is getting better and more human readable. The dream of programming since Grace Hopper has been \"what if we could program computers using human-readable language, not symbols and machine language?\" It's not a coincidence why Python is incredibly popular. Human readable is the end-state.",

Consider proactively approaching your manager about taking on additional responsibilities, proposing process improvements, or contributing to other teams' projects. Frame it as professional growth rather than admitting you're underutilized.Start exploring other opportunities before this situation damages your skills or motivation further. You can use a service like Applyre to passively search while still employed.

I could see this working again as a senior doing more deep dive or complex tasks that no one can rly question, but as an aspiring mid level I think I'm just gonna have to get stuff done, maybe delay it by a day or two and be transparent im testing my ticket.I got average/good reviews most of the time. I got a bad performance review twice in a row, that taking it easy caught up during crunch time.I stepped it up and cleared my name, just didn't matter bc we got mass laid off anyway lol. I consider myself successful, because the same boss that gave me the bad review got laid off with me - and ultimately gave me referrals + was a strong testimony to help me get my new job.I would use that free time to up skill now though. I would study whatever it takes to be successful for interviews in devops, or even just see if you have interest in learning any kind of tech in a deeper setting like reading books/documents or building out small little projects (way easier to do that now with AI as a starting point). Otherwise go the company route and start looking around with coworkers, your manager, or even some sister teams and explore what work is out there.

CS roles also get an extreme number of applicants for entry roles compared to accounting. How many entry level accounting roles get 800+ apps globally within a day?Also, many people on this subreddit are global, they are coming from places like India where the outlook is much worse for them especially since they are targeting western/American companies.",

SO. HARD. :(idk if i have much to offer in terms of advice, but maybe knowing you're not alone will make you feel better! the industry feels brutal right now (like it's not made for us anymore) and I just don't want to be a part of it. I know it feels like throwing away everything my life(career) has been building up towards, but it's also kinda freeing. I do feel that the ways we think / approach problems is unique to our practice, and can be helpful in many other practices. IMO do a solid quiet-quit and try your best to work on things on the side to see what sticks for you. It's a luxury to be able to pivot while still getting an income! sorry if Im just ranting and didn't offer any meaningful advice; just felt the need to share bc I'm going through similar stuff!

There will be winners, losers, and companies that were just along for the ride during AI. Have you been looking at switching companies rather than switching fields? Not every company has the same view of AI as your current company. You're probably suffering from burnout, from the mix of surviving three rounds of layoffs and how unpleasant your current working environment has become. Out of curiosity, how much have you been thinking about this switch? Part of why I mention this is that other fields aren't necessarily better. Nursing comes up often in this sub, but if you ever look at the nursing sub, they are pretty miserable there. They are understaffed, and we're just 5 years off from a pandemic where lots of nurses were dying.I saw a video recently that said Private Equity firms were buying out plumbers in cities. Once they've bought out enough, they will drop their rates to put the others out of business. Then, they'll drive rates up. There are a lot of fields going through change right now. I'm personally in the camp that AI will be another tool we use, and there will be blowback when the bubble eventually bursts. It's just not sustainable, and eventually, there will be callout for actual results. Then all that money being invested will have to be invested elsewhere.",

Beyond that I give my employer 8 or 9 hours a day, sometimes a bit afterhours or weekends (typically when there's a process I need to kick off an wait, babysitting basically).IMO you MUST make time for continued education or you will risk being left behind, if that happens you may be stuck on a treadmill at a company with no chance of growth.A job is a job, your career should be your #1 concern.EDIT: And mind your health.

I got hired at age 40 for my first job with no CS degree at the time(I've since completed it) and no experience in the industry. But one thing I did have was that I was far better than most junior devs coming out of college, because I put the work in for several years prior. Now you don't need to take several years to transition. In my case, I always assumed wrongly that those people with CS degrees were better than I was, but as I continued to become better and better and take code challenges and pass with \"professional level\" code grades, I started to believe that I was good enough and started applying to jobs. It took me a few interviews to land my first job but it's been like a rocket ship going straight up in my career ever since.",

Does your pip have concrete and attainable goals? If not, ask for them. If your boss refuses then complain to HR or his boss. If your pip has clear achievable goals then i would bet it’s because your boss has noticed things and wants you to improve.

It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward \"coffee chat\" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.That feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to \"network\" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The \"friends\" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",

Go out to lunch regularly.

You'll only really need a fairly basic, 2-weeks worth of learning, to make what most 2.7GPA CS grads can do right now.But CS will become much more specialized requirements (like a real engineer). Roles that are for software engineers will be heavily leveraging the education you got in school, rather than just during the technical interview and then you never think about data structures and algorithms until the next interview.Operating systems, at-metal, embedded systems, extreme performance and reliability. These are the things you'll be making, rather than \"plz change button color to #FAAB1F\".Architects will drop off the face of the Earth, because EVERYONE in CS will need to be aware of and thinking about architecture from day 1. This will only be a dedicated role in the most extreme companies.It all ultimately depends on what the business majors decide though. If they decide that they have no reason to keep you around because LLMs are \"good enough for government work!\" then you won't have a job, even if the manager at the organization is being a complete dunce for thinking AI can do everything when it can't. Because often times, customers don't care if the software works ALL the time. They just want it to EVENTUALLY work.But if customers start saying, \"Ya know what, Facebook crashes so goddamn much, I'm done with it.\" Then they might start hiring people back again.\\#unionize will be your most important thing you can do over the next 5 years, but NOBODY will be willing to do it for a variety of incredibly stupid reasons.",

Team clearly burnt out and getting short with each other, it’s just sad.I’ve been lucky enough to get many interviews and it’s brutal. 6-7 rounds per company, really positive feedback, just to get to the end and be told they ended up hiring someone else with years more experience.

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.It's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.That part's out of our control.What's in our control is how we react to it.WLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a \"OK, will take a look tomorrow morning\".There's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies \"tighten the belt\" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane. In the medium/long term find another job ASAP. It's a sinking ship culture-wise.",

The true goal is value creation, solving real problems in ways that generate revenue or reduce costs. The closer you are to understanding and shaping those revenue streams, the more valuable and resilient you’ll be in today’s engineering job market.So while the market is tough right now, this could actually be a good time to pivot or upskill toward roles that give you exposure to business domains, how companies operate, make money, and serve customers. A contract role as a consultant may be easier to land in this environment, and can help you build exactly that kind of experience.At the same time, starting a side project or business, something where you have to identify a customer need, build software for it, and try to monetize, can help you develop the kind of product thinking and entrepreneurial mindset that employers and clients increasingly value.",

Just doing lots of LC practice and reading solutions you should be building this mapping. Also in your practice you need to sort of streamline the thought process along with the toolset.Think of it like branch prediction in computers. The computer just guesses what it's going to need to do next and it starts prefetching data and executing instructions. It might guess wrong sometimes and do some wasted work, but overall things happen way faster than if the cpu was just waiting around.Another analogy is like competitive games/sports. The way you get good at these things is by internalizing the playbook so that you can make snap decisions in the moment based on the scenario. Obviously you get there by lots of focused applied practice. LC is pretty similar. When you first start it's normal to sit around brainstorming and headscratching a problem and that's fine but realistically that's just not a viable approach in an interview, so you have to internalize the playbook.",

U gotta understand if you're applying for a job and there's even one or two applicants who have internship experience on their resume, they're not gonna hire you over them. The most important part of college especially if your studying CS is to secure an internship. Otherwise you more than likely ain't breaking into tech as a software engineer. Is it possible without an internship? Yes. Is it probable ? No. There's so many applicants with real work experience and internships too choose from. Why would they choose the guy who doesn't have that?",

I have years of experience, and I’ve had conversations with someone who was working at Hobby Lobby a few months before. Don’t let someone lacking emotional intelligence get you down. I had a recruiter start harassing me on LinkedIn because I was being considered for a contract-to-hire role at Chase that was a higher rate than she was used to seeing. She kept trying to insist I was lying. I just blocked her. No good advice on how to network. You need to find people willing to talk to someone, effectively a stranger, for very little in return. It’s a challenge. I recently accepted some LinkedIn invites from random new grads from my college, but I had too many personal things come up to follow up with them. It’s a very hard market right now. You know that. It just takes more time and effort than normally. One thing I’d encourage you to do more of is learning and expanding your skillset. You say it’s been 7 months. You can learn quite a bit in time like that. Maybe you should try learning some things to make yourself a stronger candidate. AWS had a free tier. You could get exposure to cloud services that will help you grow. I encounter a lot of experienced people who still don’t have a lot of cloud experience.",

Most of these places weren’t advertising their roles online, the hidden job market is a real thing (hell one interview I got because I got to know someone on my street, and their son was working at a place that was looking for an engineer, they called up their son and I had a chat with them, they went back to their leadership team and considered starting a grad program that didn’t exist before and gave me an interview for it, I didn’t get it, but then they recommended me to another place that then did similar). Because they were small they didn’t have specific recruiters, it was the head of development usually interviewing me. I did have a personal project I had been working on and was excited about it. It wasn’t a standard tutorial or project that everyone had done. I like to think it was that my excitement about my project shined through, because at several places I pulled out my laptop to show the project, and each time it usually ended up with me doing 15 minutes of pair programming with them. A side note: learning pair programming skills is super useful! Not just professionally useful, but great for interviews. Talking through what you are doing as you do it. AMA!",

As someone who's conducted hundreds of these, here's the unwritten rule they don't tell you:Interviewers aren't just evaluating your code – they're checking if you can explain it to someone who barely understands Big O notation (looking at you, product managers). For two-pointer problems, they're usually listening for:* Why not a hash map? (Trade-offs in space complexity? Input constraints?)* Did you consider if the input was 10x larger? Would your approach still hold?* \"Faster\" isn't enough – they want to hear \"O(n) time with O(1) space because...\"Here's the real pro move: Tools like Verve AI or LockedIn are low-key amazing for practicing these explanations. They simulate that annoying \"but why?\" follow-up question you always get. And full disclosure – as an interviewer, I don't care if candidates use these (hell, I use ChatGPT and Claude daily). What matters is whether you actually understand the concepts.Hang in there though – landing that first interview after 6 months means you're close.",

In such an unusual situation, unusual measures could be needed and depending on other circumstances it could be the right choice for a lead to take a heavy-handed approach. Even if it involves compromises. BUT I would expect in such a situation is that he would spin off tasks to the team, and you. E.g. he could ask you to review things, create tests (unit and others), design/impl of additional feature/functionality, ci/cd, documentation based on his notes - he should be able to quite quickly write down at east the key design decisions and premises etc. as he goes along. This should be able to speed up the delivery. It would only cost him maybe 10-15% of the time but still deliver a bigger boost than this, even if the rest are juniors. Maybe you can suggest this to him, e.g. offer to help in the way that stands least in the way.",

I’ve been working for a while, the title is “Software Developer”, it’s a small enough team that I work in every part of the stack and it’s been a dream. It’s fast paced enough to learn a lot but no worry of burnout. They are all about learning and are happy to help me become a better dev without judgement, they are even gonna pay for me to get my masters. The tech stack is great in my opinion as well. They have had no talk of layoffs or anything, it’s very stable and I’m so lucky. It’s in a very small town so there’s little competition but the town is based around research/bombs (I don’t work with those thankfully but it funds everything) so the work is really fascinating, we have contracts with some big names.

I've used it for that. No ads, small companies showup, companies with 0 postings show up. LinkedIn doesn't make it super obvious that's even an option, but it's here: [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies)Once I find a company, I go straight to that company's careers page to see the full picture of what they're hiring for. Pretty regularly the all-knowing LinkedIn job search algorithm shows me roles that aren't good fits for me, and hides ones that are good fits. When I'm on the company's website, I see *everything* they're hiring for., and can decide for myself what is/isn't a good fit.If they aren't hiring, I make a note of that, and I revisit them in a week. A company hiring 0 SWE's today, could literally be hiring 20 tomorrow. A lot of the job search is timing and luck, and LinkedIn is not good at that.Google is a great company search tool as well. \"Top X companies for WLB\", \"Up and coming companies in \\[city\\]\", \"Best companies in \\[industry\\]\", etc, etc, etc. There's tons of different search terms that turn up endless articles out there on Google that list tons companies. I've never run out. Don't limit your search to tech companies, don't try to inject terms about software, or tech stack. Focus on finding companies.

I've had way better luck going direct to company career pages and using some lesser-known job boards.A few alternatives that have worked for me:**Direct company searches:** Use Google with operators like `site:lever.co \"Product Manager\" London` or `site:greenhouse.io \"Software Engineer\" Remote`. Also try `site:workday.com`, `site:jobvite.com`, `site:smartrecruiters.com`, and `site:bamboohr.com`. These are the actual application systems companies use, so you're seeing jobs before they hit the big boards.**Recruiter hunting:** Find recruiters who specialize in your field on LinkedIn and connect directly. They often have unlisted roles.The real game-changer though is tailoring your applications properly. Most people just spray the same resume everywhere, but companies want to see you've actually read their posting. I doubled my interview rate once I started matching my experience with specific job requirements.Also check out Wellfound (formerly AngelList) and RemoteOK if you're open to startups or remote work.If you'd like I can share tools that can help with CV tailoring and job tracking. There are some decent options out there that make the whole process less painful.",

(Basically a to-apply queue) Keep it to like no more than 2 roles per company.Up to this point its all a mobile first process... So I can do it literally whenever. Then when I have some time I'll empty the queue (apply).The reason I put the very high filter is you don't want to apply to things where some random outlier keeps that company in the sample. When one person got $450k but everything else is around $120k... well that's obviously either:- Fake, or+ A special exception they madeThe real question is, \"what can I reasonably expect?\" and you can't use any other sites filter b/c TC can be insanely different from base.After applying I'll wait for the confirmation email, I then tag those as \"confirmed applications\".

I'll have a lot to talk about if someone asks about them, but it has done nothing to catch any attention, even on entry level listings.For those that are curious so they can judge for themselves; the first project is a WebSocket based chat server written in Go. It has message caching with Redis(Valkey), long term message storage via PostgreSQL, and an admin panel via React where admins can create chat channels, ban users, and search message history. The server was containerized with Docker compose and used Caddy as a reverse proxy with TLS. I did a basic chat client in Qt/QML and C++.The second project was a basic audio DAW/tracker where you could cache audio samples, sequence patterns, and play them back. It was in C++ and Qt/QML with RtAudio to create the audio stream. I had to explore multi-threading and lock-free design for this project and genuinely learned a lot. I even separated the gui from the audio engine and made my engine a static library, in case I wanted to switch away from Qt in the future.I know it's not a replacement for job experience, but they did nothing for me. I figured going off the beaten path would benefit me, but no pay off yet.",

Recruiters speak \"years of experience\" and \"accredited education\" exclusively.I'll add that the project is 100% useless in any case if you can't speak competently, verbally, to the design and implementation. Why this, why that, what if ... I and my engineers are asking a lot of questions that start this way.Personally I care about impact/value and demonstrated ability to work on a team. Show me those 2 things and the focus of the interview will shift to your project/product. We hired the guy with no degree who built a Roblox game with 4 other people that peaked at ~1000 concurrent players. Was it technically impressive? Not particularly -- their contributions are what I would expect of any fresh undergrad. Are there Roblox games with higher concurrent player counts? Probably I don't play.

I'm just going to dump my thoughts on the interview process and how far I have to go still.I refused to accept I'm not good enough for this industry despite failing so much. It took me 1k+ applications, 20+ different position interviews, to get 1 decent offer (that is still a pretty big downgrade to my last 2 jobs).I have anxiety and have a low stress tolerance, so I was fighting twice as hard because I couldn't make myself study more than 1-2 hours a day + I would get super nervous during interviews and it made it very hard to recall what I studied for.Maybe it was because I took it easy for most of my work life, maybe I just was supposed to be interview prepping during down time. For whatever reason, I could not adapt to what it took to pass interviews.The random trivia questions just get me. I don't have memorized small little stuff like making random SQL queries verbally or specific syntax or concepts for coding languages. I've gotten better at it studying and getting live interviews for months - even then I'm still missing questions sometimes. I HATED that feeling of completely blanking out on something that sounds easy, but the pressure and the fact I just Google this stuff when I need it at work made it so hard for me.Part of it was me stretching the truth in my resume, but early on they wanted me to be able to talk more deeply about CI/CD, and cloud/devops + QA experience. I just didn't know that stuff and lost a lot of early interviews bc of that. After I studied some major concepts and talking points - it was good enough for most interviews but some people would DIG in and expose me.I'd get a small coding live assignment that would be similar to a homework you'd get in first/second year college - but you have 10-15 minutes to do it. I immensely struggled with the pressure even if it was \"easy\".  I started timing myself doing LC easies and pretend to try to simulate that pressure.I'd get Leetcode, the worst I saw was Mediums in interviews. I wasn't that good at it, but at least that one is straight forward on how to improve even if it's many hours and hard.I got a take home once + did one personal project, and used AI to make it. I then went back and revised it after it was working to make it feel more like \"my code\", and then studied the code base with AI until I could defend the entire codebase. I did end up passing that specific interview. I will admit, making a personal project in my stack did help a little when I was discussing trivia questions and concepts bc it was more fresh.I got system design in 2 dif interviews, failed them both. Maybe the landscape is changing with AI but I felt like system design for 3 YOE was very unfair. I did not study this stuff, I'll work on it studying on the job in addition to this other shit above.I think I got a lot better at behaviorals, but I don't think I had the best stories about what I accomplished at work at first. I will literally be on the lookout to hunt for good project stories at my next job, whether it's work I did or it's my coworkers. As long as you can reasonably explain the STAR and talk at a high level about the coding and the decision making and paint a good story - I think you can get away with it even if you are borrowing someone else's stories.",

It's a rigorous program and will fail people out.You get the same job with a BS in CS as you do an MS. Maybe 10% of jobs list an MS as a plus. But yeah you'd have to go MS in CS with a Math degree. Get more in debt for choosing the wrong degree at the start.Problem with all CS is how overcrowded it is. Not enough jobs for everyone. Check this sub out. Some people make it, some don't.

If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that. So if you want to learn mathematics in some sense to widen your perspective, a well thought out CS course load and maybe some reading on the weekend can definitely do that. CS isn't really that far mathematics if you look at it the right way.",

Are you in NH because it’s close to home and family ? Yes google overlooks the coop at MIT but loads of other people work there and the myriad of firms that are in Boston and the surrounding cities. Also loads of Keene alumni in the area as well so don’t dismiss it as the price for 4 years tuition is lower than one year at some private colleges at the same academic regard and level. Contact them directly and ask them for advice. If you don’t have drive or ambition going to a top tier school won’t get you hired for long. My suggestion is that you figure out an area of focus that’s likely close to the tech stack you’re doing for work as a test engineer ( if possible but if it’s cobol or some old spaghetti just take the mulligan )and then use that to jump into a dev role.",

Think about it, what does using an LLM really show? All it really shows is that you know how to make an API call. It's really not that impressive and most importantly it won't help you stand out from other developers that bring more to the table.If you go deeper than that and into the ML side, how do you know what will actually be in demand?

My main interests also involves scale and I'm interested in getting to work with companies that deal with high throughput or distributed systems. I graduated from a 3-4th tier uni in 2023 and only work at a Fortune 500 company in enterprise right now. I'm in the process of job searching and hope to land a job at big tech or adjacent within 6 months (fingers crossed) so I can work on more interesting problems and to relocate.I also have already applied to OMSCS and am awaiting decision for Spring 2026, but due to the aforementioned goals, I'm planning to defer my start date for a year to get a chance to job hop as well as to sit on the thought for a bit. I imagine you're also wishing to do the computing systems specialization as well? My main concerns with a masters also align with yours too - between the gym, hobbies, my gf - and the idea that I can simply redirect the time commitment to get hands on experience with my interests at work anyways.I've emailed a Meta Staff engineer who also had a masters and he mostly concluded with the popular opinion that it wasn't much useful outside of having a good time. I think for my case I can see that it can be a backup option for me in terms of better job security given a pessimistic market: for you, I feel that landing in Meta out of college is all the opportunity that you need :) If I was in your spot I think I'd forgo the masters and focus on the other important things in life, we spend too much time inside anyways. At the end of the day do you think you'll gain fulfillment out of it? If you're already at Meta the ROI probably isn't that high",

I recommend sticking with CS if you like math because it dips into math theory, if you've already taken discrete math. Also look into a math minor, due to the math usually needed in CS concentrations you complete a lot of the requirements by default and all you need to do is take 1 or 2 more classes.Anyway just to stoke your curiosity, want to learn a little more math theory? what about solving questions like seeing how long your search method might take to search for a value in a linked list of idk 1023456889 items? That's my two cents though. Whatever you pick make sure you keep your mind open to learning.",

Not liking where tech is headed and every other company does not seem appealing to me as much anymore. I’m not feeling fulfilled because of different reasons although it’s somewhat comparable to yours. I’m planning on an exit after I get bonus and traveling the world for a bit and get some inspiration as to what I want to do next.Can’t really provide you with any recommendations, everyone is different. But I would start exploring things or ideas you’ve been putting off. For me that’s photography and hiking/nature, traveling. I’ll find a way to monetize it hopefully.",

The demand for experienced backend engineers who can handle complex distributed systems, databases, and infrastructure at scale typically outweighs the supply, driving salaries up. iOS development, while still well-compensated, has become more specialized and competitive.Backend roles also offer more diverse career paths that can lead to higher compensation. You can evolve into systems architecture, DevOps, or engineering management more easily than from mobile-specific roles. The skills transfer better across different companies and industries, giving you more negotiating power.However, the transition isn't trivial. Backend development requires different thinking about scalability, data modeling, and system design that takes time to master. You can use a service like Applyre to passively search for entry level roles. Consider whether your boredom with iOS stems from the work itself or just your current company's mobile projects. Sometimes switching companies or teams can reignite interest without requiring a complete skill pivot. That said, if you're genuinely drawn to backend challenges and want to maximize earning potential, the transition could be worthwhile given your existing programming foundation.",

Technical focus usually has a minimal impact.As a staff FAANG engineer in the SF Bay Area with competing offers you’d earn a multiple of what you’d make as a senior engineer where only one small private non-tech company is hiring in the Midwest. Lowest to highest compensation there’s about a 20:1 ratio within the US and 300:1 internationally.If you want to earn more learn leadership to multiply other people's impact. Salary is linear with level, bonus goes up with its square, and equity is exponential.Work for a growing public tech company which pays equity and bonus on top of base salary. With increasing level base salary becomes a minority of your compensation.Work in a US tech hub, ideally the San Francisco Bay Area. Pay is higher for comparable jobs and the abundance means you're more likely to have one available at a higher level which matches your specialization. The cost of living will be greater but you'll accumulate more with $300K compensation and $3K rent than $100K and $1K respectively.In theory you could make more as an AI/ML engineer, although by the time you can gain experience compensation will level out as supply and demand come into balance.",

If you're solely relying on AI or someone else to find out the answers to things, when it comes to getting/keeping a job, how much more useful are you going to be than AI or someone offshore that companies may try to replace you with? I'm not saying you should never use AI or ask other people for help, but I think you should also consider what other ways you might be able to go through to find the answers to some of these things. In particular, if your question is whether or not a piece of code works, there should be a way to test that out without AI or asking someone else.",
