It actually works really well and one of the few services where you can drill down and request a specific city and OS. Like, if I want to test a regional routing setting on my site I can request a crawl from a Android 13 phone in Baytown Texas and in seconds I get a result back and I can even see it on my end to verify. The scary thing about this service is that I can request a crawl and if it is something illegal, that phone is on the hook until they can claim that they were not the ones that requested the site.",

I spend 75% of my time writing 1000 line python scripts that are either complex one-off multisystem data pulls or building custom pipelines for merging data from those systems in a deployable way. 10% of my time is spent providing guidance on data systems, admin on our business applications and dev on functions internal to those. 10% is spent doing huge data cleaning jobs (our data is a complete shitshow). And the remaining 5% is basic analyst stuff like dashboards, live reports, and light analysis. Hell one of my current 6 main projects is building a Data Lakehouse on AWS for serving business data and reporting.The difference for me is we are a global SaaS company, but even one of our data scientists has come to me for pipeline dev and recommendations for data arch for a function in a chatbot they are developing.Fortunately my direct superior is on the same page and helping advocate for a title change (which would get a raise with it per company policy). But what I did was took the job description, broke the tasks in the job description down into 'typical role of task' (ie dashboarding and light analysis is typically a data analyst, building and maintaining pipelines via script and platform engineering is data engineer, but more fleshed out than that), I then added in any tasks I do that are not in my job description. I then gave a percentage of my time spent on each domain to illustrate that 90% of my time goes to tasks that are firmly in the domain of a Data Engineer. Fortunately my boss is chill and an advocate and he took that and actually added supporting examples of tasks I have completed that are outside of my job description and is taking it to the C-Suite person he reports to so we can get me a title that reflects my work. I recommend doing something of that nature with some added answers to what is the value add for the company of each of these tasks.",

I’m assuming you want a DE career path; if not shut it down and stopped doing the extra work. Generally speaking DE is not an entry level position. And with this economy even so called junior roles are asking for a lot of experience/skillsets. It sounds like you have a great opportunity to shape your own career and have on the job training/experience without much restrictions. Start offering to make everything you built so far, more efficient, more analytical, more robust, more real time. If they like what you’re saying, then you have free rein to set up traditional DE systems and architecture, giving you experience people would gladly pay for. Once you feel you’ve nailed down the experience and skillset, go and explore the market.",

How do you know that fixed it, other than adding a basic regression test each time you find one that doesn't get caught. I do think it's useful for examples, asking questions about your code and best practices (also it's OK to not align with best practices the real world very rarely has perfect alignment to what Fang companies use). Using SQL is also so important, I'm often in calls where I'm able to prove whether something is true during the call. Or just look at a coworkers query and understand why their results aren't as expected. That takes some time. To me LLMs are like having a junior coworker, I think if you treat it like another junior coworker and double check it's work but assume it can do 70% of it, then it'll be a useful tool.

I would break it down into two: the ability to perform the tasks well, and the ability to grow as engineer. The first means that the stuff you produce is maintainable by other engineers and has a good quality artifacts on output. The second is about making more complex projects without losing quality of the solution.If you can do both, it doesn't matter if you use LLMs or not.

They want their report to be beautiful and nice.And engineers once to achieve only provide things that work all the time.To make this happens you obviously do less fluff and do more boring thing but then they never break, they are robust, the are fast and you never have to touch it again it just work.The stack is cool but I think what we usually look for in Junior role is someone that will take time to review himself. I know it sounds boring but I’ll rather hire a junior which return me a take home test without spelling errors, with a ok code but that’s structure and well explain than someone with awesome code but that’s all over the place that didn’t have description on topics and that did way more than expected.In terms of stack focus on SQL. Not because it’s the best but because it’s the easiest. And because it’s the easiest It’s the most used. I’ll rather use a transformation framework with SQL than pandas for example because I know anyone in the company will be able to use it and so some simple transformation. Even if something it would make more sense to go the other way.Go read DBT best practices docs. They have a bunch on their site. Read them multiple times. Understanding the structure is th le best thing you can do.Then python. Maybe learn the request framework and how to dump a response to json or parquet in s3.Than prefect, Dagster, mage, Luigi are good candidates for orchestration. Learn the basics. I don’t think you’ll find a project which give you enough things that you’ll hit common business issues with them. But having an overview on how you structure your things is already great.Good luck",

It’s definitely a stack that can get you work, and it’s a stack that requires a lot of good basic principles, especially if you have to build the functionality from scratch. I think it’s a pretty good middle ground for cutting your teeth in data engineering. It’s very powerful and flexible, but still has quite a bit of abstraction/simplifications via snowflake and prefect. Where are you hosting and executing your prefect code? Is it all on your local machine? If you become a full-time data engineer, it’s definitely not going to be on your computer. You’re going to want at least some basic understanding of how cloud services work, probably UNIX operating systems, and different ways to manage remote devices. A lot of data engineering is infrastructure Ideally you won’t have to worry about this too much as a junior. but that really depends on where you go.

On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).If you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and \"probably\" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, \"look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now\", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. But I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to \"shortcut\" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",

From there, I start introducing some basic data strategy concepts and keep improving things step by step.

Quantify impact and tie to dollars when possible. Prioritize use cases by impact and complexity. Complexity is not just technical, may include availability or interest of business stakeholders required. Look for quick win(s), ideally that you could knock out yourself assuming you have no team. Get business leadership onboard and have them instruct IT to give you the access and tools you need. This is the way.

As someone who's navigated this evolving field, I'd suggest focusing on the core skills first: SQL, Python, and a solid understanding of data pipelines. Then, gradually branch out based on your interests and industry trends.For beginners in 2025, I'd recommend:1. Master SQL and Python2. Learn one orchestration tool (Airflow is still relevant)3. Understand basic data quality concepts4. Get familiar with cloud-based distributed computing (e.g., BigQuery)5. Build a simple end-to-end projectThe key is to start small and build incrementally. Don't get overwhelmed by the expanding landscape. I've seen many successful data engineers start with these basics and learn specialized tools on the job.BTW, if you're interested in the analytics side, I write about career paths in data on my Experimentation Career Blog on Substack. It might give you some ideas on how to approach your learning journey. Remember, the goal is to build a strong foundation and stay curious!",

Moose as an \"ORM\" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)We've done something \"similar\" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to \"think\" about the database.I'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach? I'd imagine most people in this sub probably just love the raw ClickHouse/database interface anyway, but anyways... curious what people think",

They also have a philosophy of making dsta tooling as simple to use as possible.If I was looking for a platform for complicated data transformations and many file formats, then I'd choose Databricks. If I wanted something to upload JSON/CSV or Parquet files then I'd go with Snowflake. Given the choice, budget and need I'd probably use them together.Chances are that both platforms are thousands of times more capable than most people will ever appreciate",

Make sure you log in. Start solving problems. You choose a year and then start with the first problem. They get insanely hard at the end of each year but just go for the first problems each year. You have 9 years total so that gives you 9 easy problems. Then solve the second problem each year, and so on.After solving a bunch of those you'll have a decent grasp about the language. From there, the sky is the limit. You can go in any direction.Later problems actually \"teach\" you some solid CS concepts by throwing you at the deep end of the pool and you see why the naive solution doesn't work and the challenge is to code the \"proper\" solution.

Every time they saw a duplicate value - normalised. They normalised so much they actually went full circle and started duplicating data, but across multiple tables instead of duplicate values in a single table which didn't change much.Personally, I think normalisation is a lot more nuanced than it can appear.",

To be honest, the overhead and cost in terms of dev of maintaning normalized tables and their data modelling is higher than throwing a query and letting the engine handle the compute. I wouldnt imagine building an ER diagram of the warehouse for analytical and transactional workloads that i recently built. Not even at point blank against a shotgun :face_with_tears_of_joy:I keep my tables in silver/int 1:1 against stage/bronze in a medallion. Its all the same shenanigan. In final layer or prefinal, i.e. a sublayer within silver, do the heavy join and create a data product",

Ultimately, this ends up leading to excessive joins to retrieve values that could have just flowed through from upstream without any changes.We'll definitely keep some normalization where it makes sense.",

He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.Things he did while managing the small data team:1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

Mess up the retry settings and you are either burning through your quota or missing data with no clue why.Fivetran handles retries better but if something silently fails or rows get dropped, you may not know until you are paged. We had a few late night surprises there. Integrate.io’s worth a look. Handles PII masking and lets you tweak backoff/retry per connector, throws alerts when throttling hits, and has row-level tracking so you can pinpoint what went wrong. You can also look into dlt if you are already deep in the Databricks ecosystem.API reliability and incremental syncs are way tougher than people think especially if your SLA’s under 15 minutes.

It was breaking every couple of days, instead of running for 5 minutes it would get stuck in infinite loops and we would not be able to kill it, so I had to ask the DevOps to reboot our Airbyte server.At some point I got fed up with it and migrated everything to custom python scripts, using dlt to push the data into our Postgres database.Here is the code. I could have used dlt's native hubspot integration but since I had already written my `make_v3_api_call` function I kept it.While setting it up I understood why Airbyte was often breaking, because Hubspot's APIs are shit. They have 3 concurrent versions, all of them with specific functionalities. That's why here I replace all the deals every time the script is ran, instead of doing incremental loading, because we have only around 200 deals in Hubspot so it takes a couple of seconds. url = config.endpoints['deals'] @dlt.resource(max_table_nesting=0) def extract_data(url): data = config.make_v3_api_call(url) yield data pipeline = dlt.pipeline( pipeline_name=\"hubspot_deals\", destination=\"postgres\", dataset_name=\"hubspot\" ) load_info = pipeline.run( extract_data(url), table_name=\"deals\", write_disposition=\"replace\" ) logging.info(load_info)And the API call function if you need it : def make_v3_api_call(url): headers = { 'authorization': f'Bearer {api_token}' } all_data = [] logging.info(\"API call started\") while True: response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) reponse.raise_for_status() data = response.json() all_data.extend(data['results']) if 'paging' in data and 'next' in data['paging']: url = data['paging']['next']['link'] else: logging.info(\"API call finished\") break return all_data",

This works for some businesses but is a huge no go in regulated setups. We hacked together a quick Python layer that sits before our ELT tool. Does SHA256 hashing, drops raw fields and dumps into a locked-down staging schema. It’s not perfect but it keeps us compliant without blowing up our whole pipeline.If you don't want to maintain that layer long-term then you might want to explore hybrid models. If you don’t wanna deal with maintaining that forever, look into hybrid setups. Something like Kafka + Flink for real-time masking or dbt with staging schemas and tight permissions (still after load but manageable). The whole point is that you need PII masked before the warehouse or you are screwed. Either build this yourself or hunt for a tool that does inline transform.",

There's just no way around that unless you front it with a proxy or pre-processor, which kinda defeats the point of Fivetran. SCD2 via dbt also works but adds overhead fast.Airbyte gives you the control, especially if you're self-hosting, but the PII masking and SCD2 will be on you to build or glue together. That gets messy if you're trying to hit a 15-min SLA with high reliability and source API quirks.Have you considered using a streaming CDC layer like Debezium or a change-data tool in front of the warehouse, and doing light pre-processing (like hashing) inline before landing to Snowflake? Or using something like Estuary, which can do incremental syncs, apply hashing inline before data hits the destination, and supports low-latency replication with built-in schema drift handling. Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.Quick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?I work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift. Also, we're adding true source-level masking functionality very soon, it's already being build",

Shallow learning curve, juniors can do senior work with it. Supports parallelism etc, it can scale to faster than the tools you mentioned. Much cheaper than the more expensive tool you mentioned (about 1-2% cost, idk about the other tool)1. you can [pseudonymise](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns) before loading. you can even load to a local duckdb and then [sync](https://dlthub.com/blog/datasets2) to your final destination after transforming if you prefer to hash in sql.2. Here is [SCD2](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/merge-loading#scd2-strategy)3. dlt is self maintaining with [schema evolution](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/schema-evolution#alert-schema-changes-to-curate-new-data) and offers you hubspot and salesforce [sources](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/) too. Community loves schema evolution because it takes most of maintenance and hard repetitive work away.4. if you don't have a run environment you could use[ github actions](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/deploy-a-pipeline/deploy-with-github-actions) or any runner, we offer deployment helpers.5. dlt is a full toolkit for just about any other common requirements you might have, and when it misses something you can just use python to bridge any gap",

Replication is incremental with SFDC (for most tables) and it will tell you if it can't do that for a specific object.I don't remember about Airbyte (looked at it before). I don't think it is as easy to maintain as compared to Fivetran, but then Fivetran probably costs more.Re: API rate limits (for SFDC): we have never had an issue with this. However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.You can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.in terms of SLA. Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time. Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).Fivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2. However, you can do a couple things here: 1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed. 2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).Fivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors). You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that). It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl). Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \\>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget. For SFDC replication, budget for $800 USD per month (depending on what objects you need). Hubspot maybe less per month.* Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it? Fivetran handles this OOTB.* Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2? Not really a function of Fivetran or Airbyte * If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes? We have had no major issues with Fivetran replication of SFDC. However, as mentioned it will not do formula fields.",

The only answers I’m really aware of here are runtime validations (we have various checks on every write (non-null assertions, no empty partitions, etc), and monitoring (usually volumes/reasonable deltas over some period of time). If you’re really fancy you can build a model for outlier detection that wouldn’t show in volume alone.Sometimes the data can shift in really unpredictable ways and cause failures. So if you have data whose cardinality you don’t control, this will always be a risk. Just last week I burned hours troubleshooting sudden failures due to viral user behavior skewing logs to an insane degree. If your data can skew, make sure you have proactive measures in place to prevent it from becoming an issue (salting before joins in spark, etc).",

Having it sketch out an island and gaps methology on a table works well. But it's always doing bad things with date inclusion ranges, making assumptions. Randomly inserting 500 fields (no joke had 15 columns called custom_param_001, custom_param_002... and it just added columns until 500). I have enough trouble vetting query logic of humans to trust that AI's advanced autocomplete will not present C Suite random sales report numbers. AI does great on structured text modification. Have documentation for a new ERP platform, want to convert it to the datatypes your warehouse supports. Super useful. It's also good at large scale refactoring even in agent mode... 'In this DBT folder introduce a project level variable called 'lookback_days' add a condition to include lookback days in non-prod target environments'... works very well.",

Then we feed the good queries into the UI as a FAQ to guide users, as well as using the FAQ index to give the model examples on how to generate new SQL queries based on new user queries. Works surprisingly well since we sat it on top of a pretty clean denormalized data warehouse. New queries that work well are given a thumbs up on the UI and get marked for review before adding to the FAQ. It’s not generating reports on top of the SQL, but it’s giving some basic analysis to get the user started. Automated report building probably comes next. These tools seriously need handholding from architectural guard rails, but the potential is there.",

This works good enough when users understand that they can ask only things that are relevant to the concrete dataset. Some users trying to ask questions that only, maybe, deus ex machina can answer ever. In general, this function is good for non-experienced users and helps them to build their first reports. For advanced report options it seems a classic UI (report builder) is still more useful and less painful that typing prompts.- Report-specific prompts: when prompt's context is a report data itself (tabular data) and users can ask their own questions to this concrete report. Typical prompts like \"discover insights\" or \"find anomalies\" are available via menu items so this is just a one click and doesn't require any efforts from end users. These predefined prompts may be specific to the concrete dataset or usage of concrete dimensions/measures - for instance, when report uses \"Sales\" values and \"Year\" dimension, admin-configured prompt may compare values according to company's specific analysis. This function helps users with interpreting reports, especially if they are large tables.",

Though, just to be the devil's advocate, here's a different take on it: * It could be useful as a way to get started very quickly, with plans to migrate to something more comprehensive later. * High cost of large jobs can be mitigated - by avoiding large, slow jobs. This isn't always possible, but I run into a ton of teams that think that as long as a job is batch performance doesn't matter. They're not thinking about cost, usability benefits of lower latency, or deployment/fix implications of their slow batch jobs. * Missing bells & whistles: simple logging & alerting is fairly easy to address, monitoring can be more, but also driven off logging, etc, etc.So, if I ran into a team that wanted to show results fast, this is what they knew, and wanted to defer for a bit trying to figure out best way to run jobs, I wouldn't be too concerned about this approach.",

For some of the smaller-scale ELT pipelines in our data platform, the final tables are exported to GCS in Parquet format.It’s extremely convenient for downstream analytics; DuckDB can attach directly to the Parquet files, has solid support for partitioned tables, and lets you skip the whole \"import into a db\" step. It also makes reusing the datasets for ML much easier than going through db queries, especially with local prototyping, etc.DuckDB on top of these modern table formats is a really powerful, especially for analytics workflows. I’m always weighing querying BQ directly (from where our data is exported) vs. just reading an exported, e.g., Parquet file. In the end, the final tables already contain all the necessary transformations, so I don’t need the crazy compute capabilities of BQ at that point. The native caching is nice though.",

But if you want to call yourself a data engineer, it's close enough. Technically data engineer is in the job title, and it would probably be the best title of the options except for maybe Machine Learning Engineer - but that seems like a lesser requirement. Could be a good role to build out a tech stack, but not great for really specializing. I'd treat this as a decent entry level role, if not underpaid and underappreciated. Eventually you'll need to find a specialty to really advance in your career.",

For orchestration you can get far with Snowflake Tasks for lightweight scheduling and eventing, or drop in Apache Airflow if you need more fanout and retries. This keeps you mostly SQL first and avoids overbuilding infra. Biggest tradeoff is you lose some of the deep Python flexibility you had with Argo but you gain a ton of maintainability and lower ops.Do you need near real time or is hourly fine? Team size and skill mix more Python heavy or SQL heavy? Any CDC from OLTP systems in scope?

Postgres uses ~~b-trees~~ heaps. Mongo uses journaling and indexes (just appending lines to a file and updating the index).Mongo writes to the disk in intervals (like 100ms). So, there's always a small (nonzero) risk of losing data if the system instantly crashes. Postgres doesn't really have this problem, because it doesn't complete the transaction until the data is safely on disk.Because Mongo just appends to a file, you may have to deal with compaction, which is when old entries get garbage collected (more or less). This isn't a problem if you're always creating new entries, but if you update or delete entries often, compaction can take time.Postgres also has compaction, but it's called vacuum and is done differently.It's supposed to be easier to use partitions/sharding in Mongo. You can distribute your data across multiple clusters.You can partition data in postgres, and that data can be queried in parallel, but I'm not sure if you can actually split partitions across clusters.",

They have Iceberg compatibility which means you get some level of ACID compliance. Delta Lake is for OLAP use cases no matter how you look at it. So if you are sure that your use case is purely OLAP, then you are good to go with Databricks. You will have the same challenge of porting your DynamoDB queries though to Databricks SQL. Postgres is the most compliant SQL database where you can express your queries from very simple to very complex. It's origins is in OLTP but a lot of organizations are using them now for OLAP too. It's now even powering Vector Search use cases for AI workloads. Because of its multi-modal storage, it becomes really flexible in terms of supporting many use cases that requires certain formats - JSON, JSONB, Free Form Text, Binary, etc. You'll have to dig deeper in terms of what those users are doing with your data. That will drive your next architecture.",

Make a point of how much it costs for you to waste your time vs cost of those servers. Also make a point of how this will likely delay the project.",

Always remember to not bring in any PI data and leave it at source if not needed. It avoids whole lot of hassle and pains later. PI data has to have lots of checks in place from the model level and during DML. I'd create a word document and submit to cyber team on what AD groups, what roles, which tables access to be given to who and fields that needs to be encrypted. Document like that can be used for tracking. RBAC or column level access can be controlled and automated after identifying PI data. We have model versions in Erwin for back tracking, use GitHub PR for approvals. After our PR is approved then we merge feature branch into main branch and merge our modeling Erwin model mart. This ensures both GitHub and Erwin models are in sync.",

Problem (problem for OpenMetadata ingestion) is that Cosmos will parse dbt project, and for each model creates separate task, which helps a lot of granularity, parallelism, and easier to maintain, and its simply how it should be done on Airflow. But it also generates 'run\\_results.json' for each of the models separately in temporary directory. Now we can always use callback to move it to any place we would like, but then we have run\\_results.json for each of the models. Do i simply have one last step to merge all of the run\\_results.json files or there is an alternative strategy?",

It should bring back chunks semantically related to health checks. From the metadata of these chunks, you can get what tools are bound to be useful for this task. Notice I didn't mention the LLM yet, we'll circle back to it later.Ok, so you have a few chunks from man pages and pointers to various tools. Passing all the man pages may be too much, so, what to do? One option is pre-generating one summary per tool, including things like required arguments, and sending it along with the chunks you found. That's a middle term between option A and B.Now going back to the LLM call in step one. Why do you need that? You need it to generate good questions, not good answers. The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like \"What flags can I use to format the output?\" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, \"What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?\" That has a much higher chance to bring the chunks you need. It doesn't need to know your tools, only how to formulate a good question to surface those chunks from the vector DB.",

That’s just about throughput.But if you’re going straight at production CRMs or ERPs databases, that’s where it gets delicate. A sloppy WHERE date > last_refresh_date on a huge table can be a full scan, lock things up, and suddenly, the app is crawling. You do that once. The critical system goes down for a few hours and requires a reatart. The trust with your C-level is gone. After that, you’ll only be allowed to receive CSVs by email that they extract for you :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:CDC on database sources is great, but you have to know how the logs behave. They can balloon, not every system handles them cleanly, and if you’re unlucky, you get stuck pulling GBs of changes that still slow down the source. I’ve lived the nightmare with MariaDB on a payments system. No matter how much you tune it, it just drags. Sql Server and others handle cdc great. No matter what you do, you must not affect source systems.I try to keep it simple:• API when available.• If you must hit a critical DB, use a read replica.• Be aware of replica lag and don’t rely on it for anything that needs read-after-write.If you’re lucky enough to be on RDS or similar, spinning up a read replica is dead simple. It costs a little more, but it saves you from nightmare scenarios, and your DBAs will actually like you better.",

I used Looker Studio at my previous company (small company and also used AWS RDS just like yours) and it works fine with the MySQL connector but it’s obvious how well integrated the BigQuery connectors are. One way to possibly improve performance on the RDS is to create separate schema for a makeshift data warehouse. Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables. You can put all the complicated joins and stuff in these stored procedures. Then only connect Looker to this dedicated schema with a simple select * from datawarehouse.cleanTable. That way you’re not relying on Looker to run these complex queries externally which I frequently had problems with.",

Most companies need automation more than the latest tech and tools.>Has anyone gone through something similar?Self taught across 6-8 months, so a lot less experienced than yourself, and went straight into a DE role. Learning on the job was very fair in my first role because I filled a gap they needed - automation and modernisation. In an ironic way, I know I just say companies need automation more than the latest tools, however, this role was fun because my job was to learn the latest tools and see how they could be offered to clients internally and externally.After 18 months, I got my second job. Learning became a lot easier because I had already seen most things before.

You know that if they all have a date field you can load Jan 1st. Then if you look at the max date you’ve loaded you’ll see Jan first so you can easily load some date after.If your data is completed, using a sequential number will always be best. It’s also usually easier to order your data based on those sequential fields which makes query sample of data faster to select.If your data is not technically completed. (You are receiving transactions through the day but you want them aggregated even if the day is not yet completed) you usually are better creating a timestamps field and loading new data based on that field.

It’s extremely simple to implement and does exactly what our goal is pull all new transactions.If you were to do it by transactional ID you’d have to check every ID for all of time in your source against the list of IDs in your target . Imagine if the source and the target are in 2 separate systems that would suck to implement. Also since the source is a transactional system with mutable tables the record may have changed so you’d have to compare the IDs AND the timestamps to ensure you don’t miss any updated records.",

Direct being key. That should answer your question regarding Google.If your job is specifically within the software for a sales team I would argue you as revenue. They couldn’t do their sales jobs as good without you 2 is a hard distinction, almost all cost centers support the revenue business in some way as all companies exist to make money. You wouldn’t have them in the first place if they contributed nothing. I think the way to look at is do you fully support the revenue cycle or do you support everyone. IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them 3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context. And guess what, sales guys do get fired in hard times, but the top/critical sales guys usually are not. Once a company intentionally negatively impacts revenue they enter a tailspin and they have a finite amount of time to correct5 I can answer this directly. Yes.

What they will do though is cut cost centers more aggressively than profit centers.So what the saying is trying to say is “be on the team who’s work directly causes cash to come into the business” which, unfortunately, data engineering teams almost never bring money directly into the business.It also doesn’t mean that positions in cost centers are inherently dangerous. It’s more that if given the choice it’s (usually) safer to work in a profit center. I’d argue that working in a profit center comes with its own problems though.",

As long as you are satisfying business requirements (keeping systems up and running), the cheaper you can do it, the better. This would fit if you were doing maintenance and basic prod support, cyber security, governance, etc.Profit center: should be enabling the business to increase revenue and/or cut costs. You should be able to justify your expenses in terms of added business value (\"yes Mr. CEO, my expenses did increase by 300k year over year, but the new system integrations are estimated to increase bottom line profits by over 1 million per year\"). A data engineering profit center should be churning out valuable data pipelines, minimizing time to market, working closely with stakeholders, etc. Or you can have the worst of both worlds where you have the expectations of a profit center (build things fast, enable the business, etc) but then get treated as a cost center when budget allocations come around. Profit centers are more fun to work for, but they are also going to be more demanding. Cost centers are usually stable employment, but with outsourcing, it is much less so.",

Profit = income - cost. You can break costs down to things like operating expenses and taxes if you feel fancy. If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. The trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics. And there is still very much the risk that the ‘true’ profit centres complain that you’re a cost to *them*, bringing their numbers down come bonus time.",

People here are confusing an accounting system concept for some sort of philosophical judgement.One transaction can hit both a profit center and a cost center at the same, too!! In fact, many do.Profit centers are used to categorize the products or services that a company sells. By using profit centers, when examining a business you could say one division is more profitable than another division, etc.You might try to say oh well Jeff is responsible for increasing profit through his role, but that’s an indirect thing. Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn’t a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it’s possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",

This would put you at 100-200K requests/day which would not cover your needs if it’s a single news site, but could be fine if it’s multiple that can run in parallel. As for the actual scraping, of course the site will try and prevent scraping or overloading of their infrastructure, so try these things (somewhat in order)- fetch and save just the html of the url with curl, curl_cffi, httpx or similar. This could work fine if you stay under any rate limits. You can then extract the text from the html later on. - adjust your user agent and cookies, for example by copying the request headers from an actual browser session- Try and figure out if they have a front-end API that serves one or multiple articles at the same time. This could make it easier to get the correct text and stay under rate limits. - Use an automated browser like playwright - Use an automated browser and hide any features that give away that it’s automated (e.g. puppeteer stealth)- If you hit any rate limits, use a service that provides residential proxies and use any of the above",

Most people - especially non-developers who just casually use the chat consume a very limited amount of tokens so it is cheaper to give them the api than apy x EUR/Month/User even when not using some service2) The template includes self-serving components for local models to further increase privacy and how how easy this isThis template is not static and set in stone - if you think you might be able to contribute an integration with cognee this would be highly appreciated.",

        "body": "Sorry, contract with employer doesn't allow me to, and she sql produced is snowflake-specific (uses as-of joins) I can describe the steps of the algo, though. you start with a collection of events. To make examples simpler we will assume you only have one entity that produces the events, and all rows (events) represent states of that one entity. If the terminology is confusing, just think that event can be pressing a lever to open a door, and the door being open or cloded is a state. let's say event a (little a) causes state A (big a) to begin. If the entity (e.g. door) already was in state A, then it continues to be in that state. Event b causes state B, etc. For further simplification, we will count time in integer numbers 1,2,5,...,8,12,... . In reality time is usually a date, or timestamp, but anything that is orderable can be used here. So assuming our times and events look like this: \\`\\`\\` 1, a 3, a 4, b 5, b 7, a 9, c \\`\\`\\` We have contiguous repetitions of events a and b, and we have non-contiguous repetition of a (at time 7) What we want to get is a table representing the states and their durations state, start-time, end-time \\`\\`\\` A, 1, 4 B, 4, 7 A, 7, 9 C, 9, Null \\`\\`\\` We kept the non-contiguous repetitions, but ignored the contiguous ones.This is close to our real end-result, so how can we get from there to here?First find all consecutive pairs. More formally - pair each row with the row that has smallest time which is still bigger than this row's time. This can be done with a self-join (or two), join + window functions or as-of join.Get rid of all result rows, where the event is the same, we only want transitions.We'll call this data set Transitions. \\`\\`\\` 3, a, 4, b 5, b, 7, a 7, a, 9, c \\`\\`\\`From transitions we can take the earlier time + event in a separate CTE - these will be our state endings.Yes, endings, even though we thought of them as the earlier ones. Since we listed state transitions - then it follows that the last event representing some state will happen BEFORE the first event in the next state.Also, from transitions, we take the later time + event and call them Beginnings, due to the same reasoning.Eagle eyed reader will have noticed that we are missing the first event of the first state. We should add that to Beginnings (e.g. with a union all)Now that we have beginning and endings of each state we join each beginning with the next consecutive ending (again, smallest time, that is larger / later than that if a particular beginning)the time of beginning is the island start time, time of ending is the island end time. the state, that corresponds to the beginning event is the state of the island.Of course that was a simplified example. In reality, the state is an ensemble of various fields, but these can be hashed into one, or compared one to one.Usually we also deal with more than one entity (think many doors and their corresponding levers), but to accommodate that, you just group your CTEs by the columns that constitute the entity identifier.",

ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors) Pinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors) If your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.Personally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.I don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.Since you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.What kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?Btw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",

For hands-on learning, practice with real scenarios on platforms like LeetCode's database problems, study case studies from companies like Netflix and Uber about their data architecture decisions, and get familiar with both OLTP and OLAP system design patterns. The key is understanding not just how these systems work, but when and why you'd choose one approach over another.The reality is that interviewers will throw curveball questions about specific trade-offs between consistency and availability, or ask you to design a system that handles both real-time and batch processing. They want to see you think through problems like choosing between row-based and columnar storage, or explaining why you'd use a particular indexing strategy for a given query pattern. These conversations can get technical fast, and having real examples from your experience combined with solid theoretical knowledge makes all the difference. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) because these database design questions can make or break data engineering interviews - having a tool to help you navigate the technical depth and articulate your reasoning clearly can be a game changer when you're in the hot seat.",

You're correct that Synapse is no longer seeing significant feature development; we do continue to ship security fixes, bug fixes, et cetera. I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. And it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. And I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.I also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more \"best performance or least duplication\" tradeoff.Why wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?Well, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. Synapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. So we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. Could we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D. If you have questions on migrating to Fabric, or on Synapse, you can find me and many other folks who work on both Fabric and Synapse in r/MicrosoftFabric or lurking here.Or just tag me or message me, though there's no Service Level Agreement for my response times on Reddit :P",

Works pretty well in terms of writing SQL, but in practice you have to tweak the hell out of it to get it to consistently write the correct logic based on the data concepts. In production it's even scarier as companies often refer to business concepts with different descriptions (hell, I don't even understand the ask sometimes because their description is so bad). Then the feedback they get is often the SQL itself, which is gibberish to most people so they can't validate that the LLM got it right. So kind of depends on what you are trying to do and who your target audience is, but that's the way to go about it and the drawbacks.",

LLMs need way more context than just schema info.Few things that have worked for me: semantic layers like dbt definitely help but you still need tons of example queries paired with business questions. Vanna AI approach is solid for this. Also worth checking out tools like Waii or Text2SQL.ai that specialize in this problem.The real issue is that business users describe things completely differently than how the data is actually structured. Like they'll ask for \"revenue\" but your table has \"net_sales_amount\" or whatever. You almost need a translation layer between business language and actual schema.Have you tried fine tuning a model on your specific schema with lots of query examples? That seems to work better than just throwing documentation at it.",

Not sure about Athena and the like, but databases like Snowflake support column level security through things like projection policies, which hide columns which users should not have access to entirely. As far as stacking DBT on top of this, although I haven't tested it, you can probably write queries similar to this:```sqlselect colA, colB, colC, * exclude (colA, colB, colC) -- Include additional columns if you have access to those columns.from {{ ref('my_model') }}```Alternatively, you can dynamically query what columns are available using DBT's `adapter.get_columns_in_relation`:```sql{% set columns = adapter.get_columns_in_relation(ref('my_model')) -%}select colA, colB, colC, {% for column in columns -%} {{ column.name }} {{- ',' if not loop.last }} {% endif -%}from {{ ref('my_model') }}```",

You’ll need to store a reference to the max(timestamp) from BOTH tables in the destination, so you can easily select only new records from both.In case when you run you queries and a record for one table is not available you’ll need to set a field that identify that the records is incomplete. Create a Boolean for this.Then in your downstream query you select from both sources where the timestamp is higher than the max one you store in downstream table + reload any incomplete records which exist. At some point you’ll get both tables and you can set the Boolean to true.The merge statement will handle the refresh.If possible don’t just put the UUID as the key in your upset statement put some timestamp or sequential columns so you can prune records and not lookup the entire table.Goodluck",

I definitely have doubts, but in theory some things could be replaced here and there. But the main thing I think is that in many careers including tech, these LLMs have no judgment, it's all just guesswork. Humans actually have judgment, they can be put in charge of things and knowingly take calculated risks, I don't believe LLMs have any real concept of this, when you ask them questions regarding more soft skill type stuff instead of strictly technical, they just BS you and basically answer the question however they think you wanted them to answer it, or they give a non-commital answer, etc. They can't really be trusted for anything serious and I think that will remain a huge gap for decades at least.",

It simply pulls together a code block from github, stack exchange, or any other sites in its dataset and tries to craft a response based on your prompt. When suggesting auto-complete code, it tries to predict the prompt as well.When I say “doesn’t understand code”, I mean it doesn’t understand that the code it returns has to compile and work.

Sure, some people are uniquely talented enough to jump straight into a senior management position. But for most people, you need to cut your teeth at a junior level for a few years and work your way up. With those lower level positions rapidly disappearing, EVERY job listing is starting to look like “5-12 years of professional experience required”.And that’s assuming you have a CS degree. People like me (non-CS degree, self-taught programming for years, recently completing a year-long full stack boot camp) have zero chance right now. It doesn’t matter if I’m a better critical thinker, better at problem solving, have a deeper understanding of the programmer mindset, have better social skills, or have higher potential. It’s unlikely, verging on impossible, that I’ll ever even make it past the automatic filters. None of that fluffy stuff like being ‘passionate, hardworking, and always eager to learn’, matters a bit until you actually land a job.That’s what’s so disheartening and frustrating.

It's pointless \"distinction without difference\" bullshit, frankly. It's misinformation at best. There's no universal list of knowledge/skill/activity per label (\"programmer\", \"coder\", \"developer\") just like there's no universal list of responsibilities per job title (\"software engineer\", \"programmer\", \"developer\"). Those of us who've been around a while have likely seen and held all of those titles and done the same, and differing, day to day work. Different orgs refer to people and roles slightly differently, absent protections for certain professional titles (e.g. Engineer).If you want to say that it takes a programmer (or coder, or software engineer, or developer...) to be able to evaluate the output of LLMs in a particular context in order for LLMs to be useful for building complex software, just say that. There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology. It just leads to wider confusion, and questions like \"what's the difference between X and Y\" where there is no meaningful difference, or the difference depends on the specific org etc. It also waters down your argument with doublespeak.There is no difference between coding and programming.

It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.People are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.People using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.We might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.At present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.Lastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",

There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.For people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.For the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future. Now that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.But again, \"learning to code\" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",

I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!On AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. Programming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.One of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it. The many small wins are really gratifying.",

Put your phone away, get away from distractions and carve out a chunk of time just for learning. Set up pomodoro if that helps. If you can’t focus because you don’t know what is going on use structured tutorials like boots.dev or TechwithTim (good course on python with projects) to get your foundations and do not move on to the next lesson until you absolutely understand everything, use AI like a tutor to explain to you. Otherwise lookup a cool project like ecommerce platform on YouTube in your goal stack and just learn it part by part to get an idea how software worksThe mental fog could also be medical like iron deficiency, or bad sleeping habits, exercising beforehand can give you a boost of energy",

I asked the receptionist nicely and she went and grabbed a spare for me. When I got back to the office, I got to hear the management telling my boss that the keys were numbered and it simply wasn't possible to give me a key. As I triumphantly held up the key, my boss told them that their system had failed and hung up. The next week I baked a batch of cookies in the morning and dropped them off for the office next door. Soft skills makes things smoother. People look out for you and you can sometimes get a small job squeaked through even though everything is booked.But you have to remember that everything goes both ways. You have to express your appreciation and bribery when people bend over backwards to help you out. Fresh bread, cookies, a box of live crickets delivered to the office, whatever will spark joy in the person who helped you. Hell, mail them a physical card saying thank you.",

Back when we were starting, you could just have the basic skills with almost no qualifications and stumble into a job. Also, startups aside, there used to be a lot more job security in general at the bigger corporations, but that doesn't seem to be the current climate.Regarding AI, I'm not saying it's gonna replace us all, but it's certainly causing a kind of mass hysteria/industry transformation/paradigm shift, and I don't know whether that will ultimately be for better or worse, I'm betting on worse. My personal thing is that I got into this career because I love to code and debug, but I never enjoyed all the other stuff, from design to meetings to bureaucracy to operations. Well with AI, the coding aspect is kind of ruined in my opinion, like being a good coder gives you very little edge, and on the job the coding will become more and more prompt engineering stuff which is just whatever, and the job will reduce down to just the other aspects.",

For a basic game, I would just have it pick a random index in the board list until it finds an empty one, and have the computer choose that spot.Rinse and repeat. Try to solve a problem, if you run into an issue, look for solutions (not answers).This is the best way to learn as a beginner.",

If you enjoy it, you'll naturally want to do it often, read about it, take courses, etc. - basically, you'll have drive. It takes a certain analytical mind to enjoy coding, but it also takes a creative mind. You have to enjoy making things and solving problems.2. Naturally, at first you're going to suck at it. This applies to anything new. When I just started, I was terrible. I once \"randomized\" an array by generating random numbers and putting them in each slot, waiting longer and longer for the correct unused number as the array filled up. You need to push through this learning curve - there's no way around it. It took me about 6 years to become even moderately decent.3. You mentioned switching from one language to another. Here's the thing about programming: it's way more about understanding the concepts than memorizing the specific language syntax. If you understand how variables work, how if-else statements function, how loops operate, etc., you're already 80% of the way there with any language. The remaining 20% is just syntax differences you can easily look up when needed.",

The third of those eventually migrated to C#, and for a while there was a component built in Microsoft Silverlight. The whole thing was source controlled in Rational Clear Case, but for some reason I don’t recall we couldn’t run it on the Linux boxes where we built that part of the product. (Young folks: Silverlight was an unsuccessful competitor to Macromedia / Adobe Flash. At the time I was working on it, VB6 was already ancient. ClearCase is what big companies used before git.)To tie all this random crap together, I wrote a Ruby script that applied labels, downloaded snapshots of the code, then either pushed the code to a Linux box to be built there, or built it locally on the server. It was an insane, janky, Rube Goldberg setup. And to drive it all, I wrote a DSL in Ruby to tell it what I wanted it to build. As horrible as the whole thing was in retrospect, the DSL was incredibly easy to understand. Nobody working on the project would have any difficulty understanding what it did, even if they didn’t know precisely how it was doing it. I could have made that whole thing just take a JSON file, but it would probably have been just a little more confusing for users. Also, at the time, JSON was only three years old. Holy shit I feel ancient.",

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and \"something\" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say \"hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x\" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says \"ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database\". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve. I glossed over some details for sure, but this idea helped it click for me when I was earlier on in my journey.",

For example, in the context of back end web dev you've used Express to specify a chain of handlers/behaviour that each request will pass through at runtime (using .use(), .get(), .post() for config etc.). One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms. Ultimately it's just a way to organise data and code in a program.Maybe looking at the GoF design patterns will give you ideas about how OOP is applied to problems commonly faced building software.

This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview. If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.My advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking.

It's only easy from the human perspective. It doesn't take you more than a minute to do that calculation, but you process the string in whatever order you want. That is, if you had had * or /, you would have handled that computation first.By contrast, the string is an array of characters, and you have to translate it numbers, plus apply the operator. Because it's infix, it's quite a challenge to do it accurately. As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.I suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. There is a bunch of ways to solve it. If you could create a second array, you could have replaced +/- with spaces, and then split on that. Then pull out the integers into an array, then process the +/- from the array.I don't think this is an easy programming problem at all.Another person suggested creating a binary tree. That means you'd have to know your binary trees well, and how to put an expression into a binary tree.",

In no circumstance would I have read through all my documentation to spot issues this way, because it would take at least a whole day.Then I asked it to improve test coverage, it ran the test coverage tools and unit tests, after about 10 minutes it had suggested another batch of changes that took me 5-10 minutes to review. I brought my test coverage up from 87 to 96%.I then asked it to check that terminology is consistent between my function documentation. Asked it to organise my unit tests into logically related blocks, asked it to write descriptions for unit tests into a particular way. Essentially I have a lot of tasks that I would need to spend a few hours on, that AI can do for me in a few minutes, and I can check in 5-10 minutes.

I would give it broader statements about what I wanted and trust the code it produced. That would lead to bugs I couldn't fix and code I didn't understand.

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",

This goes a long way, also, DRY, when you need to add logging, it is easier to add it to a single function instead of dotted all over the place.Write obvious code. Respect the the house coding style (very important on so many levels), resist the urge to \"be clever\" even if it causes pain! LOL. Save the clever stuff for your own stuff. Under pressure, if I can see code and see what it does almost immediately because it has no references to external (global) state, relies only on its inputs, has meaningful variable names (i,j,k for loops is kind of ok) then I am happy.A good Smalltalk pattern I picked up from buying Kent Becks book is called \"Intention Revealing Selector\", this should be The Way, here is a chunk of half-decent AI guff from my browser:>Intention Revealing Selector>An \"intention-revealing selector\" is a naming convention used in programming, particularly in languages like Smalltalk, where method names (referred to as selectors) should clearly express the purpose or intent of the method rather than the specific implementation details. The goal is to make the code self-documenting by naming methods after what they achieve or why they are needed, rather than how they achieve it. For example, a method named searchFor: is considered better than linearSearchFor: because it reveals the intent (searching) without disclosing the underlying algorithm (linear search).>This practice helps developers understand the code's purpose at a glance, improving readability and maintainability. A method name should answer key questions about its function, such as what it does, what it returns, and how it handles edge cases, ideally without requiring additional comments. The principle is that the name itself should convey the method's intent, allowing other developers to grasp its role in the system without needing to analyze the implementation. This concept is also known as \"Intention-Revealing Method\" or \"Intention-Revealing Name\" and is considered a best practice in clean code.Following that rule and the other stuff I mentioned is a good starting point regardless of the language.",

In fact, JS should probably only ever be used by anybody if and when they have a compelling reason why they can't use TS instead.Learning TS will also teach you JS; all you need to learn there are which TS bits are \"extra\".The one thing JS has over TS is the way you can just plug a tiny snippet into a webpage and have it do something.

Stores the salt as part of the final hash string (bcrypt hashes are structured strings with version info, cost factor, salt, and hash all together).When you call bcrypt.compare(password, storedHash):1. It reads the salt from storedHash.2. Repeats the hashing process with that exact salt and the password you just entered.3.

The point was indeed to maximise exposure to different languages without expecting students to become experts in any of them. We wanted them to come away with “programming mindsets” where they could solve a given junior-level problem with loops, conditionals and functions, and an awareness that different languages have different “quirks” in the syntax for these concepts. For example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…Going further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.When you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time. But if you google “rust post request endpoint” you’ll get example code for the Actix Web framework.Knowing the concepts are way more important than learning the syntax.",

You'll have to learn about databases, SQL and how to make an API, but that's fairly trivial.For example, learn about the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) package and read [Best practices for RESTful web API design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) and boom, back-end achieved. Next step is about actually saving that data.To save data, you need a database and you'll need to talk to it through a Structured Query Language called SQL. You can learn SQL [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), but then the database stuff gets a bit complicated. You can install MariaDB locally and learn on that, then in the future you'll want to learn about Docker Compose to avoid having to install the DB locally during development and you'll probably want to use PostgreSQL, but right now it doesn't matter. Just go with SQL/MariaDB and learn the concepts.Once you've got a database, your Node.js app will need to somehow connect to the database you just installed. For MariaDB, there's a [package](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors/mariadb-connector-nodejs/getting-started-with-the-node-js-connector) for that.Boom, back-end with API and data storage achieved, without tutorial, all by yourself. It's the same steps for any programming language.Admittedly, that route is what a tutorial would give you, but anyway. Concepts are what's valuable at the moment. Or if you feel like you'd have more fun in Go than TypeScript, then just go for it, it'll be roughly the same thing.",

Go is a web-focused language and it's extremely powerful. The biggest difficulties you'll have with a Go backend is that it's harder to host, especially for free, especially when not using Docker - and, it's harder to wire up to some of the modern metaframeworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.So, in theory, I don't see anything wrong with skipping Python in favor of Go. I pretty much never build Python backends. I've built a Django site and a FastAPI site, as \"portfolio projects\", for my my portfolio. But I have no interest in Python backends.",

You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.After using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. Then download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.Then try setting a debug point. Now go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.If you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required. Lastly pick a smaller project rather than a huge one. It will make all of the above steps much easier.",

Probably the best way to do it is to read the docs (if they exist), then copy and paste everything you see that is of relevance into an AI chat, which will take time and you will have to worry about context awareness. But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.Good luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",

Sometimes you can gain the domain knowledge simply by being a user of the software, but other times you will have to do research and/or read documentation. A personal anecdote is that I recently fixed a bug on Ffmpeg without being very knowledgeable about media encoding but only because I encountered the bug while using the software, so I knew what the issue and expected outcome was, and since it was a simple fix in an isolated portion of the code I didn’t have to be an expert on the code base.

See how people raise issues, how they get assigned, what a PR looks like, how the discussion looks and what PRs are getting approved. 2. Create your own small project and structure it the same way. Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags. Usually this is someone just trying to do what I outlined above for themself. The codebase and issue should be simple. Work on getting assigned some easy issues and getting your PRs merged. 5. Then just repeat with slightly larger and more complex tasks as you feel more and more comfortable. When learning to swim you wouldn't jump into the middle of the ocean, so don't do it with open source. Start in the shallow end and build up your confidence and skills slowly. I don't think this is a quick way to make money however. It's a long game. If all you need is money id look into trying to teach coding to beginners or have a completely seperate side job. You'll get more ROI on your time in the short term through those channels. I know you said you won't consider it because of your schedule, but it'll be a more efficient use of your time and help you develop your soft skills.",

Big corporations in the US, Germany, Japan, etc. may indeed have strict degree requirements for SWE roles, especially entry-level. Highly competitive graduate schemes and certain government and defense jobs do require accredited degrees. In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has. Nobody will give you a high paying job just for waving with degrees and certain alone. Amassing a ton of certs without any real work done and lacking a strong focus will also do the opposite, making you look like a “qualifications hoarder”.",

I'm not entirely sure on how to do it in the second example.And you can have private variables in classes - which isn't immediately possible with functions.In my view both are \"classes\" in that they define a prototype that every new instance inherits from - and I insist that you can actually draw a class diagram of your React components, even though they don't use the word \"class\".Soooooo, to answer your question: most web developers don't use the `class` keyword regularly, but they do use the concept of *classes* all the time, although maybe more as types or interfaces in TypeScript.",

A template for creating a collection of variables and functionality (a Java class)3. An instance of that class templateBecause the syntax is different, you instantly know which you’re looking at. In js, all three of these things are a function when conceptually they do different things. So, class is generally added syntax that’s still a prototype function and still does the same thing, but potentially it lets your components be clearer. In general you’re going to find that js is a lot less explicit about everything than other languages. This isn’t exactly a problem but it can be a mess for maintenance purposes. Other languages have more natural organization.",

Unlike say Java where every file must be a class/record, we have modules in JS that can bundle functions and create namespaces that still serve as logical separation of concerns which means a lot of things don’t need to be a class. But if you have a concept of something that has some sort of state, and functions that manage that state, then to me a class is the simplest way to express that concept.

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it. Either make sure these projects have a landing page, preview, or anything else. Or make a showcase with pictures and videos in your portfolio - For some reason the whole website feels cheap, i cannot quite explain why objectively. I think its the look and the color scheme of the stars in the background. But could also be the overal color scheme and font- Last but not least, i would put maybe a little bit more information about yourself and in general, its kinda emptyAnd one note, whatever the SEO situation is, you probably don't need seo at all for a personal portolio. No one who you didn't already send your portfolio website is gonna look you up on google and search for it.This is all constructive criticism. Hope the post doesnt turn into a [deleted] and you actually make some improvements and update us. Good luck!",

Took screenshots of your feedback to make sure it doesn’t get deleted :DI’ll definitely work on the things you mentioned, I have a bucket load of stuff to work on at the moment, I actually completely forget about UWQ screensizes, so that is good you mentioned it since that definitely needs to be worked on! Same as with the landing page, Noto actually does have one but I seemed to have messed up the routing which takes it directly to login. I do however need to refactor the entire discord bot dashboard since it’s built using outdated CRA. So I will add a good landing page to that soon! Sincerely appreciate the feedback! I’ll let you know when everything is fixed and you can maybe check back in on it <3",

Best practice is to use good, descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and so on. That way, comments are not as needed. Such as, \"drawCard\" is a good name; it clearly states what the code does, so there is no need for a comment. A lot of your comments are completely unnecessary, and gives absolutely no extra information. Such as the x != y, followed by \"#chedks that x != y\", as you pretty much have in one of your examples. This comment is useless, as is does not add anything of value what so ever, it's just clutter. Comments can be ok if it states the why, if that is not clear and obvious from the context. If the comments are on your own code, and you are the only one reading it, it does not matter so much, but it could be a good idea to focus on writing code that is easy enough to read that you don't need to write so many comments. One thing is that the comments can get in the way, make clutter, and actually make it more tedious to read. Another thing is that if you change the code, you also have to change around the comments, and that creates extra work, and could cause problems if you forget to update a comment, and it no longer matches your code.",

In fact they're probably a good idea!When you start to work with other people, the rule is \"Good code is self-documenting,\" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.Use variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\"] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable. But if we only care how a card gets its name and value, we don't have to read any of the funky code that gets the suit.",

It's not like they contribute to code bloat - they are discarded at compile time.Whenever I write new code, I often stub a new function with comments initially and then write the code beneath each major comment. Not only does this help me keep track of major considerations, it also helps me spot design flaws from trying to do too much in a single method.

Doesn't really matter for development.So how do you pick what to use? You'll get tons of answers. One answer could be that you should use whatever your team currently uses. Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. For you, the answer is \"whatever you want\". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. Like javascript a lot? Use MERN. More of a Python guy? Use Flask or Fast API and pick either Vue or React for the frontend. Want to learn more vanilla javascript and not bother with frameworks? Cool. You don't need React or Vue or any other framework. For other tools, make sure you're comfortable with git, github, working in bash or zsh or some other *nix shell.

Do you think you'd pay someone to generate a maze and let the computer find the way out? I'm guessing no.Right now, your skills are pretty basic.For example, if someone wanted you to design a web application where customers could put in orders, and make payment via credit card, would you know how to do that? This becomes a bit dangerous because you'd have to store credit card info securely, find some company that does that work (it would be unrealistic for you to do it) or use something like Paypal. If you tried, you might get something to work, but it could be done in a pretty janky way, and they may expect you to maintain it for free forever which would be crazy.Customers might request something insane for little to no money, and keep adding requests, figuring they can get something for cheap.I'd agree to look at fiverr and try some of the projects on your own, but I suspect, with only one year of experience, it's not enough unless someone wants something super basic which they could easily hire someone more experienced to do.Again, imagine what code *you'd* pay for--and how much you'd pay for it.",

It’s good for slop coding where it can do remedial tasks great but it’s never going to beat you to the punch on a memory/time optimized solution.Regardless of what field you end up going to work for just keep in mind it’s tough right now and a ton of young people are going through the exact same thing right now.

Right now the government isn’t hiring anyone even very little coops. Also it’s not about the curriculum it’s what you demonstrate on your resume, have an active github to showcase, put projects in your Experience section of your resume and advertise it like experience. I had extremely high grades and added relevant projects in my resume to the application as experience and I think that’s what got me an interview (gov). Also had a cloud cert. I also knew someone in class who got an interview at Shopify no previous degree but a very active GitHub of many projects, did great on her initial assessment of building a wikipedia backend (she added great frontend). She previously received an interview from referral, so it was easier for her to get selected for subsequent interviews. So curriculum is less of a factor",

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying. Don't be set in stone; instead, be pragmatic and flexible.",

To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",

You add a hash\\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords.

This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database.

To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.The other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.I expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",

You only need to know the goal and thinking about what it is you need to get there. As you think about them, just write out the code even if it is bad and make ***zero-sense***. It just has to make some sense to you somehow and you alone. Think of it like your subconscious working for you. And once you have enough pieces built, everything will just click and make sense. If you ever watch an artist working on a brand new piece, you would understand what this is about. Professional artists always do a super rough sketch skeleton first, then they work a bit here and a bit there, but never complete. The process would look very strange to everyone including the artist. But when it is all done, the artist would look back and think about how he/she actually arrive at the final piece. From that experience, he/she would rationalize what must have been going on in his/her head. And that's the story he/she tells the world. Same thing with novel writers, this is why most good writers are constantly revising, never satisfied.e: A key to successfully learning from your projects is making mistakes. Since AI can't make mistakes, it is better if you do everything yourself to get the maximum benefit.",

There were a few milestones I do remember, though: First, when I learned to focus on projects over practice, programming started to come much more naturally to me. Second, when I learned the concepts of software engineering, I started to view programming as an end rather than some thing on its own (when it became a medium for a story like English in your analogy).It was a continuous process, but I can't really quantify how skilled I was at the time, because I wasn't doing the same thing enough to compare over time.To go into domains a little:The process will be different for every domain, as programming is just means to an end. This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:Banking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).Comparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution. Your learning resources are gonna be more subjective and decentralized, as the requirements are much fuzzier and the market isn't \"solved.\" This means you can break into the market via invention *or* innovation.",

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, \"I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code.\" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought \"Maybe if I SEND these people my code...\" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, \"Hey, I found a bug in the code.\" And he literally said, \"Well, fix it.\" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. After a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. Really, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.I doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut. Also, I could do wonders with copy of Petzold's Programming Windows, a DOS 4.0 manual, and some DB stuff. Now the list of things to learn is as long as both of your arms.I'd say, if that's what you want to do, don't let anything stop you, work or study 12 hours a day or more, WRITE CODE ALL THE TIME, be persistent and focused. Maybe that'll work eventually.",

No matter what is covered in a system design interview it will never even approximate what a truly large scale system looks like that is worked on by thousands of people and serves billions of users.You also aren’t expected in a professional role as a low level dev to be able to architect such a system, and even then it’s not one person doing all of it. However system design interviews do have some utility though in that it can help you think with a distributed mindset to make reasonable decisions from the get go with scalability in mind. Even then nothing of that scale is done in one pass, it starts small and gets bigger over timeid recommend Designing Data Intensive Applications, its a nice starting point for understanding the common components involved and is more thorough than online resources or YouTube.Id also recommend actually getting in the weeds and trying to design something simple, like a Todo app, but with the requirement it can handle 1M daily users. Set up a load balancer, experiment with kubernetes, use services like Kafka and write your services to operate on a stream processing model, try setting up a sharded and replicated database, write a CI/CD pipeline, get used to working with containers and IaaC. you can even load test your own box or a VPS to test its scalability. This way you can get hands on experience with things you’ll probably end up using in the real world",

If you are worried about not getting everything down you may as well worry about the fact that you haven't mastered Scratch in it's entirety.Use cs50 as a springboard. Refine and revisit fundamentals as you continue your learning journey as you need them. Dive into other areas of specialisation to build the projects you want to. And it's honestly pointless to compare yourself with others - whether you are really fast or slow. Prof Malan himself mentions something along the lines of it only being useful to compare the knowledge and expertise you've acquired with your previous knowledge and expertise. Some people have prior experience, others none. Some people are interested in particular areas and will deep dive, others will just skim sections they aren't that into. So just focus on what you are getting out of it and whether that fulfils your goals.",

Have a try at learning react using the react documentation. It's good to get used to doing this. It's a hard skill to fully describe but you eventually get used to skimming documentation like this to very quickly get \"the point\" and the kind of style and thought patterns behind the idea of this library or framework, and then as you start to work with it, you dive in to the relevant details. I feel like people fall into this trap of being a bit \\*too\\* lead by these kind of guided tours. They can keep you a little too \"on piste\", waiting for the next chapter, and that isn't \\*really\\* how true learning is done. You have seen the kind of thing react can do now. Think of something you would like to try building and just get on with it. Use the docs, and google and whatever else and bluff your way through it until you aren't bluffing anymore.

It's just in some languages they have prebuild data structures for you, others you will have to build them yourself.Also You seem do be confusing Java with Javascript. Java isn't used in Web development. Javascript is. Two very different things.(Correction: as others have pointed out, Java is used on the Backend side, I just assumed you meant web frontends. So you likely won't be writing a website using Java, but the service that powers it and the endpoints. ) You will find Java mostly at large scale enterprise software and Backend systems. When you count Kotlin (which is very close to Java) then maybe also at Android development. The question 'What language should I learn' very much depends on 'what do I want to build?'.

They stay with the IDE, sync across instances and are project independent, so whatever I open in my IDE I will always have access to those.

The 6502 CPU is one of the most commonly used CPUs in history. It was used in famous systems like the Apple II series, the Commodore ViC20, C64, C128 (where also a Zilog Z-80 CPU was used along), and even in NES systems. It is a well documented architecture with plenty available Assemblers, Disassemblers, emulators, tutorials/courses, etc.So, if you don't have a particular goal in mind, and maybe want to dive a little into retro computing, then, the 6502 architecture is the way to go.I started with the Zilog Z-80 CPU as this was the architecture my home computer used way back in the 1980s. Also wasn't too difficult to get into.Another option would be, if you are interested in microcontrollers, embedded programming, to go with the Intel 8031/8051/8080 CPU architecture, which somewhat is the predecessor of the Intel 8086 CPU. That's what I used at my degree. Also very well documented and easy to learn.In general, the 8-bit architectures of old are way easier to learn than the modern 32 and 64 bit architectures.",

Learn something like data structures, loops, and functions, then immediately put them into practice through small, fun projects. For example, if you learn about lists and loops, build a simple quiz game or a to do list app. This way, you’ll reinforce your learning and keep it engaging. Projects don’t have to be big or complex at this stage so just think of them more as practice reps.Exam prep and coding will come down to prioritization. Your exam is the gateway to METU, so make sure that’s your main focus until it’s done. But coding can act as a mental refresh so use it as a productive break from studying. Consistency beats intensity so it’s better to code a little regularly than to burn out trying to do everything at once.

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.It's generally not meaningful to compare things like \"number of iterations\" or \"number of function calls\" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).If actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.Probably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.If you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.----An additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the \"single-source shortest paths\" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). A less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the \"frontier\" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)You might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations. That'll make it more likely to be useful in practice.",

This has downfalls so I figured maybe doing something between SPFA and Dijkstra using a parallel prefix scan or something to dynamically choose number of \"distance bins\" to iterate over each time (to make sure GPU occupancy remains high) but it seems Nvidia already does stuff like this in their cuGraph library.

Add caching with Redis only after you feel comfortable with SQL and transactions, because strong relational modeling and query skills matter more than frameworks. Learn Git, environment variables, logging and error handling as you go, then containerize the service with Docker and deploy it to a cheap managed platform so you practice secrets, database URLs and health checks. Pick one comprehensive course that uses TypeScript, Node and Postgres and that actually ships something to production with tests and CI instead of ten shorter tutorials, and keep progress tangible by building one or two tiny projects end to end such as a notes API for your Angular app and a background job that sends email digests.",

To reuse the code, we need to give it a name. So we decided to name it after what it does, like AddNumbers or GetBirthday So a function is simply a named block of code. When we write def GetBirthday we are saying here is a block of code I plan to reuse and I will call this code GetBirthdayHowever, it's not super useful if our function always returns the same data every time. For example, I may not want to get my birthday, I want to get anyone's birthday. So we introduced arguments. Arguments are input parameters that a function will accept. Some functions take no argument. Some have required arguments, and some allow for optional arguments. When I create GetBirthday, I have to include what these argument parameters are going to be.function GetBirthday(person)Then when I want to use it, I call the function.let bday = GetBirthday(john)So what's important to understand is that a function is a named block of code. It accepts inputs, which we call arguments, and it returns outputs based on the input. It can have no input, required input, or optional input, depending on how the function is defined.In most programming languages, we use the () to list the input arguments to our functions.",

        "body": "The brackets allow you to pass data into a function. In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.it’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.Simple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.Here’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.Edit: Reddit messing up formatting here.def increment(x): return x + 1count = 0count = increment(count) # updates originalnew_count = increment(count) # keeps originalCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.As you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who’s allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",

You don't need to learn Python, but if you wanted to, you could learn it online, Udemy has some courses for under $20 that are decent.2. You could, you could also find someone on the Internet. Fully trusting random people with a lucrative idea is tough. You should start with someone you know and trust who could help you network rather than looking for random people without a connection.4/5. You'd have to figure out whether you want to try to get the government contracts yourself (find out when this company's contract is up for renewal and then you'll probably need to RFP for it, etc.) or you could offer to subcontract increasing numbers leading up to all of the reports for this company for $150+ (if they only need to deliver data to you/your company and not manage a bunch of other contractors to do the reports, you're adding significant value compared to just doing a few reports a week)6. It sounds like you're saying you're worried someone is after you? The problem you're solving sounds a bit niche and if it were a glaringly obvious and easy automation case, someone would have done it already, nobody's after you.Probably want to speak to a reputable law firm about setting up the right kind of company and if you have IP that can be protected.

If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall. Nand2Tetris provides you, from recollection it's been years, with everything you should need to be able to progress through it.From the perspective of being a backend developer, I'm not sure either will really give you much ROI except that you might understand computers and software better following either.",

There's a question of what your objective is, that is, do you want to have an array of the factors as a result or just print it out. Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.But the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.Instead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. Suppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.Now `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.You might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).So, you could modify it something like float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root int limit = (int) (root + 1); for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) { if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor // It is printf(\"%d is a factor\\n\", i); int other = n / i; // Get other factor if (other != i) { // Don't double print if we hit the square root printf(\"%d is a also a factor\\n\", i); } }If you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.Hard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",

        "body": "Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.This is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.For example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.In this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like // Not using square root because i * i is more efficientcan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.However, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).The solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.So, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",

So like how a TCP connection is established, how TLS termination works at your reverse proxy, what your OS scheduler does to a busy process and why your databse chooses a plan for a given query.",

After that, move to structured interview prep sources like System Design Primer or Alex Xu’s books they’ll help you see patterns in real interview-style questions.

Is there something I could do better, a simplification I could make, a loop or repetition I could simplify or remove? Once I've done that I'll see if there are recommended solutions, or just google similar things. I think I first learnt of python list comprehension by looking at how other people solved issues, being completely baffled by this \\[f(x) for x in something\\] I kept seeing, and then just playing around to see how it worked. The whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use. I think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected. (Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \\~1M lines. Suddenly I paid a lot more attention to what my script was doing, and, for example, filtering out inputs early.)",

But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.Often also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)I still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.---I'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.But if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`I don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",

If `low < high` you print, otherwise you quit. while low <= high: # print low # increment low # check the negation of the condition if high > low: # break else # print high # decrement highSo basically, you track two variables, one for the beginning (`low`), one for the end (`high`), and you print the `low` and increment, then check if the condition `low <= high` is true, if so then print `high` and decrement the value.You can test this out with, say, an input of 3.* Prints 1 and increments low to 2* Prints 3 and decrements high to 2* Prints 2 and increments low to 3* low > high, so quit outThis was a little tricky because the decision of whether it's `low < high` or `low <= high` is not obvious and can lead to an off-by-1 error if you select the wrong one.",

I was able to have an interesting conversation with the HM during the final interview. And I have a lot of social anxiety, but had a job in the past that required I talk to people a lot on the phone. So even tho I may be awkward in social settings, my work relationships are usually much easier to maintain. Then again, I like playing politics at work, I think it's kinda fun. But here are some additional tips I'd recommend:* audibly repeat back your understanding of what someone else wants you to do to avoid confusion* Don't complain about co workers, it's fine to ask your boss for feedback on how to handle a coworker, but don't come across as attacking them. * Only bitch upwards, it's not a good look if you're complaining about bosses to people less senior than you,but when you do complain about something to your boss, offer solutions* praise often, praise early - if someone has a good idea, tell them. This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. * admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.* Use words like \"We\", \"Us\", & \"As a team\", instead of \"you created this bug on this PR\", \"we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR\", \"what if we need to add X functionality?\"* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. * when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say \"this isn't good because X, Y, Z\", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. \"Will this work under this use case?\", \"what if the user does X?\", etc. * ask your manager how other folks are doing, \"how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious\". Shows you're aware of people's emotions and you're concerned about others. I feel like there are more, but this is what I've found.",

We've gotten to this point where leaders think that they are the supermegaminds that are the only ones who could possible know what the company needs to focus on, and the reality is that figuring out what a company needs should be much more bottom up than top down - because it always needs to go to the bottom and come back up anyway.Right now the model - especially for internal work, but I'm sure also for external work - is:1. Executive comes up with \"great idea\" that is neither great nor feasible2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",

The silent recession that no one in Canada/usa wanted to admit too is the culprit.Back in the day, people used to code in assembly, and when compilers became cheap ans widly available it caused a major disruption in the job market.Same thing with the \"no hardware, all code\" mantra that established itself in the 2000s. Today, almost no cs major knows (or admits to using) C. Or even that its a seperate language from C++.Im so happy i stayed away from web stacks and kept to low level programing on Ucs and embedded linux. Not saying that AI won't replace me, but its hard to replace me when im coding gpio configs that drive transistors and debugging with scopes and DMMs.They cant replace me if were making hardware.

The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns). They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income. Profitability is king right now. Second, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough). But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe. We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. To explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them. Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department. Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience. But the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors. Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.In a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech. AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares. Plus if companies DON'T hire juniors, then when the market recovers they'll have to pay a lot more to get experienced talent... and then they're going to turn back to hiring juniors to save money.",

Like flying a plane, business don't want to risk their entire mission critical software to fully automated technology. They would rather just pay a salary to reduce that risk.

Booths would get maybe half or a third of the footfall you'd see previously. Those we did speak to only wanted to speak about layoffs.* The quality of hiring across the board in all big tech companies have fallen off a cliff. It might be a reliance on GenAI, or it might be the drop I mentioned previously, but we see far more rejections than the last few years.IMO fewer people will take CS, because they've seen enough to suggest that the jobs are hard to land, there is zero employee protection, and that the big salaries are meaningless when you're going to get PIP or laid off soon anyway.",

I'll re-iterate it here...***Good fucking luck.***Think back to college. Do you remember what an open-book test was like? I do. Whenever it was announced an exam would be open book my stomach sank. It was an awful feeling. Because that let me know the test was going to be difficult enough to *warrant* it to be open book.Interviews are going to be the same way. If you're allowed to flippantly use AI? The interview is going to be difficult enough that it ***requires*** you to use AI. It's not going to be a leetcode question from 2024 that you can blow through because you have AI at your disposal. It's going to be a uniquely crafted question that's difficult enough that you *need* AI. Fuck that.So yeah, if I were job hunting, I would be practicing leetcode. Hopefully I could line something up before the hellscape of AI-interviews takes hold, because ain't no way I'm gonna play that game.",

However, the business problems get more complex. When you go from having a few hundred users to a few billion users, how you build a product changes dramatically. You can't just YOLO out code in the same way anymore - everything needs to go through a more rigorous product development process. Also, while the work you're doing may seem simple, you're a small cog in a bigger machine. As you get more senior in your org, you become more and more responsible for figuring out how all of these cogs fit together rather than shipping out code yourself.If you're working on internal tools and infra, those teams have many of the same challenges, but also some of their own. The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions. Senior engineers have to deal directly with stakeholders within the company - product teams, other infra teams, program managers, etc. I work in a security org, and honestly stakeholder management is at least as difficult a problem for us as the engineering itself is.",

It could range from promotion to your very survival. Once you have that kind of pressure pushing on you, it is \\*entirely\\* on you to move that social aspect of things to deliver on the final product. You can no longer lean on reasons like, oh other org wasn't on board. Nope, it was your job to plan for it.While all of this is happening, you're still coding at the fastest velocity you can go.

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the \"ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$\". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",

There was a lot happening still in 'the underground' side of things, as well as tech startups.But, there were hiring freezes. There was lack of funding for startups, widespread layoffs. The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.But, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.Then, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.And discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy. Being in the know of what's going on, and having experience in new and arising tech puts you ahead of others, and not only that, allows you to better seek talent that align with goals.Back then, there weren't job sites with jobs that will never be filled, there wasn't a massive amount of CS degrees and engineering was what people promoted. Software engineers weren't as prevalent.They weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted. Amazing companies and projects died soon after staring. I wouldn't say they're near as bad as what's going on now though.If you took AI back to 2008 he'd be the one boohooing.",

The percentage job loss in tech right now is smaller than 08 (so far anyway), but there's a huge flood of CS graduates trying to get a smaller number of entry-level jobs then there were back then, so for someone just getting into the field, I think it seems worse now than it did back then. My cynical theory is that during COVID, so many high school kids saw these videos of influencers traveling the country in their vans, doing remote tech work, and making good money along the way, so these kids all said \"yeah that's what I want\" and entered CS/IT programs in droves. Now, the growth is gone. Entry-level hiring is still happening, but there is far more supply than demand so lots of graduates are being left without opportunities.",

If you can make copilot sit in a meeting (or read auto-generated meeting minutes), go through jira issues, translate user requirements into well-defined features, implement those features, write and fix unit tests, debug and fix any issues, test everything, update docs, and merge -- then yeah, I guess we are fucked.If, on the other hand, a human will need to be the interface somewhere, or will need to supervisor the bot, then companies will still need to employ software devs. Granted, with different job descriptions.So I wouldn't rely 100% on MSFT greed.

The desire for more and higher quality of those things scales with their relative ease in production. I don't understand why software wouldn't follow a similar pattern. We still have tailors and farmers today, it's just that their jobs are very different than they were before certain tools existed.The 'AI will replace devs' narrative is a bad take because it assumes the desire for software is a known or static amount. It will replace devs doing today's work, but all that means is that the role of developer changes. That's been true since the job of developer existed though. New tools make the work different.",

        "body": "The ai4 conference just ended in las vegas and the general vibe of where the AI secret sauce is heading is agentic AI. Agentic AI is where companies are now adding evals, memRAGs, pre-determined prompts and answers, and much more to increase accuracy with a proper workflow to solve a bunch of different tasks. Keep a lookout in the next month and all these new industry panels should be on the ai4 website and you can see for yourself how these companies are using LLM properly https://ai4.io/videos/. Whenever you use Grok or ChatGPT on the web is just the surface level what the latest companies are using LLM for. At the end of the day these LLMs are just probabilistic neural nets trained on very generic public internet data and are not as accurate as you want them to be since they aren't trained on the specific data for your specific needs. The accuracy is based on the transformer model and it seems we might be nearing the end of that architecture's accuracy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\\_language\\_model. The reason why LLMs are notoriously bad with logical or math calculation is because it doesn't actually do deterministic calculations but just probabilistic \"what is the most likely words it should output is\" based on your token input, aka prompt.Also, a large majority of these companies still need software developers as they are the final guard rails of these LLM outputs. Its just that the economy is kinda cooked that's all and everyone is trying to save a buck.",

Though I was under-leveled for the position I was able to leverage the experience my previous career gave me with process mapping, interviewing workers, and project management. There's also the general benefit of hiring someone who isn't 23. New-grads can be great, they tend to have a lot of hustle. But they're also not always housebroken. New grads tend to have all sorts of social, emotional, and personality problems that come with never having worked before. If you hire a career changer at 30, you're more likely to get someone who knows how to run a meeting and talk to a customer.Since your last career wasn't even outside of IT, I don't think it hurts your chances. Certainly it would be better if you had YOE as a software developer, but with a 4 year CS degree and development-adjacent work experience like shell scripting your resume certainly isn't bottom of the pile.",

When you're passionate about work, 4 hours feels productive and energizing. When you're not, 3 days feels like slow torture. Your motivation isn't broken, it's just directed elsewhere, which is completely normal for high achievers stuck in low-challenge environments.Consider setting artificial deadlines and challenges for yourself while you figure out your exit strategy.

        "body": "I had a role similar to this. It worked great for me.I would have a thing on at the weekend, be it a gig, family visit. This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.I could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.Month after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.My check ins and \"performance\" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.I had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.OK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!Despite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. It took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement. In short, I settled for £12,000 and a standard reference.",

I've seen people refuse to help unless it was documented that they'd benefit (e.g., as a mentor), and I've had coworkers who'd always give very \"constructive\" feedback to try taking people down a peg * Hold the stakeholders hostage: If your manager decides who to pip, make sure you own a process that can't fail, and never set it up to be handed off.

If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.You don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you. All your manager has to say is \"u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP.\" Boom, done.The fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.There are chances that your manager said \"they seem to be improving, but I need more time\". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them. It's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement. That happens, but it's less likely, simply because it's better to be a little short-handed than to keep a bad performer around. Besides, if your performance is bad enough to warrant a PIP, you're probably not contributing much, anyway.",

Our top devs can push way more quality code than I can, so honestly my time is better spent unblocking them. The PRs need approvals before they move to QA.The problem is still getting worse though: as more of us get better with ai, reviewing code is becoming a real bottleneck. Even with using ai to help review ai generated code, I am still responsible for the PR if I approve it, so I still need to read and understand every line.

I’ve also sent PRs back if they have more than 1 single story attached to them, they need to provide a good reason to combine them, and they still need to be small enough for me to understand what is going on. But you know what? The last product that we produced since I was given this power was one the smoothest deployment of a new product this team has ever had. Yup it sucks & you need good management to be behind you in this effort. I’ve done far gotten rid of 2 useless devs, and another is currently on a PIP. Don’t get me wrong, I do everything in my power to help teach & guide them.

But experienced devs have to *come from somewhere.* Crews of inexperienced devs vibe coding apps is just going to lead to (and are *already leading to*) terrible quality and death marches and failed projects.As experienced devs like myself move further from heads-down coding day to day, the number of people who can crush it like you describe is going to shrink. Plus, the LLMs cost money and are currently running at a loss for all of the providers, and that's not going to go on forever either.Now, that said: the CEOs can believe it'll work for a long time while they fuck up your career. But what you describe isn't sustainable: the fundamental truth is still there that experienced skilled devs come from inexperienced low-skilled devs.LLMs are going to be like compilers or IDEs with intellisense: a powerful tool that makes a skilled user more effective.

I think that the companies that hyper-fixate on not hiring junior engineers and using AI as a quick fix will die. I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.What I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",

But most companies aren't.FWIW - most places I've been at stopped hiring juniors due to belt tightening.

        "body": "Despite what it may say on a job posting, most of the requirements aren’t actually requirements. Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",

Maybe the goals aren't to get to \"the next levels\", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.Companies that do career ladders well will have a concept of \"career role\" or \"terminal\" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.That means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say \"I'll be a senior my entire life\". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same \"level\" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.The goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home... I'm sorry to say, but fewer and fewer companies are willing to pay for that. Many never did.",

What about trying to apply in different states ? Try to cast a wider net. You might have to accept an IT Help desk job again since that seems to be a skill that you can offer. If you are lucky enough to join a big company then there is potential to move up. I realize for a CS grad a Help Desk agent job is menial but you have to start at the bottom these days due to the IT labour market. That's unfortunately the reality for new grads",

A year out isn’t disqualifying, but applying cold to hundreds of roles with the same resume and hoping something lands almost always leads to burnout. The gap isn’t “no hope,” it’s about how you frame it: a short IT contract + projects can be packaged as relevant experience if you highlight impact (what problem did the project solve, who used it, what measurable outcome did it drive). Instead of grinding LeetCode in isolation, shift toward what hiring managers for new grads actually value demonstrable skills, clarity of thought, and consistency. That means polishing a strong portfolio (projects with a clear readme/demo), targeting a tighter set of companies, and most importantly, building relationships for referrals rather than relying on job boards. Many people in your shoes break through not by “out-grinding” but by reframing and repositioning. A mentor can help accelerate that process by showing you exactly how to package your story and approach the market strategically rather than aimlessly.",

Orosz is the author of the fantastic newsletter Pragmatic Engineer and he's assembled a lot of his wisdom into this fantastic book. It's broken out into sections for each level of engineering, so you'd definitely get a lot of mileage out of it.\\- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. This is a little more advanced, and you probably wouldn't need the last third that talks more about selling your architectural vision, but it's a great overview of the different kinds of distributed architectures you'll encounter in the wild.\\- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. Really quick read and an implied rebuttal to Clean Code by Bob Martin. I really enjoyed this one and it provides a good framework for how to think when writing code.The reason I've read way too many software books is because I host a podcast called Book Overflow ([YouTube link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BookOverflowPod), but we're on every major platform) where each week my co-host and I read and discuss a new tech book. We've done episodes on all the books I've listed, and have even interviewed every one of their authors! If you don't have time to read the whole books, you might get a lot of insight from just listening to the episodes!",

No other part is more critical to the success of the project.”**— Fred Brooks, \"No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering\" (1986)*Software is created to fulfill stakeholders’ objectives. To achieve that, you need to understand and document three key aspects: WHO your stakeholders are, WHAT their objectives are, and WHY those objectives matter. Most failed projects don’t fail in code; they fail in understanding what the stakeholders actually need.\"Software Requirements Essentials\" by Karl Wiegers and Candase Hokanson is short, accessible, and a great introduction.The \"bible\" of the field is Karl Wiegers’ classic \"Software Requirements\" (now in its 3rd edition, co-authored with Joy Beatty). It covers everything from stakeholder analysis to requirements elicitation techniques to use cases and beyond. It’s comprehensive, methodical, and full of real-world examples.Focusing on stakeholders and requirements makes you a better software engineer regardless of your tech stack or methodology.",

Then after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn’t know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. I had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. Wanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. Got called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. But it’s not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn’t find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest “no” I’ve ever delivered.I don’t know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you. I was too disgusted to stay so I missed out on a lot of benefits. But that was the best decision for me. You gotta find the best solution for you. Best of luck!",

It is possible that the new manager is seeing things your old manager didn't, or has different standards. That's not nefarious, that's natural. Or this could be a real sign that upper management wants him to have a more senior person. So not looking to replace you with someone cheaper, actually trying to replace you with someone more senior and independent. Juniors may be cheaper but they require a lot more hand holding and are a lot more annoying. Anyways, the point is you should both ask your manager directly and also poke around and ask the office busybody what's going on. Subtly.",

Now I am thinking about scalate this with HR so no other people suffer the same experience from that guy... What I suggest you is always focus on facts-process-communication, usually when they try to create a false sense of bad performance, they do through feelings \"I feel you are making too much questions, you should be more independent\" and then \"I feel you are not asking questions and are confusing about what it needs to be done\"...So, just focus in to the facts, I did X because you said Z, what we need to change to improve the process? Who will be responsible to do this and that? When is expected an interaction on my side?That way will be harder to point to you, because everything will be very detailed about responsibilities and times and scenarios.Hope this helps you!",

If you are adding tests as you go, you design a codebase that is testable — interfaces that are loosely coupled, no excessive need for mocks and stubs, etc. Good design manages complexity well, and when that happens, tests are trivially easy to implement. It’s very likely that the senior is able to keep a ton of context in his head, understands your dependency injection, is aware of patterns and anti patterns in the codebase, etc. That skill comes with practice and exposure.In your case I’d learn how to get really good with a debugger and understanding where you are in the stack at every step of something you are looking at.",

Lottery tickets are discretionary spending despite what gambling addicts believe. When you apply for a job, you're actively seeking a new income source. Apples and oranges.> After over 200 applications to MLE and data scientist positions (even data analyst roles that I’m clearly overqualified for), I’ve only been met with rejection or ghosting.Even before universities had specific graduate programs targeting Data Science / Machine Learning (so before 2019 lets say), it was very challenging to find a position where you fucked with models/charts, tweaked parameters, and performed EDA all day. And this was peak Data Science mania hiring among corporate leadership -- Data Science was the GenAI before GenAI existed from ~2016 through 2019. Sounds great right? Except boy do I know a ***ton*** of people in that space who got laid off between 2020 and 2022 so lets set the nostalgic rose-colored glasses down.> Both of these times, the recruiters have been enthusiastic to hear about my experience, and often praise my resume and my accomplishments.The fundamental challenge for Data Science / Machine Learning roles is an organization will need 1, maybe 2, of that type of skillset for every ~500 run-of-the-mill software engineers that they need to build software products. Maybe closer to 1 every 30 if you're a highly specialized quant firm or something. This is very specialized labor, for a very specialized purpose, and orgs just don't need that many of them relative to other roles.If you're looking exclusively in NYC, or for fully remote positions, you may very well be competing with the absolute cream of the crop top-tier candidates. NYC is an extremely competitive market -- lots of people. You could even be one of those top-tier candidates, but when there's 20 other candidates who are lets say within ~10% of each other in terms of performance and team fit coming out of an interview, what the manager had for breakfast the day of the interview could be a significant contributing factor to which candidate gets hired. The candidate that got hired instead of you doesn't necessarily need to be \"god tier\".So, some practical advice:1. Increase your volume of applications2. Target different markets/sectors. ~80% of your applications in finance, but no bites? Try energy, medical devices / medicine, ad tech -- you get the idea.",

So, even though they do hire newer programmers, they're *hoping* they can get a new mid or potential leadership candidate for minimal cost. They usually can afford to keep rolling that slot machine every few seasons.

Have a fun getaway with the wife/kids (costs range from \"gas money\" to \"whole ass resort package\")2. Work on a house project to completion (costs range from \"$0\" to a \"whole ass deck\")3. Work on a code project to completion (pretend I'm still a developer for a bit)4. Fuck off into the wilderness for a week or twoThen my battery is fully charged, and I'm good to go for several months. When I'm feeling burned out, I use my PTO or talk with my boss to see if it's OK to step away from \"important manager stuff\" to pursue #3 for a little bit. Then I get paid to recharge and didn't need to spend my PTO.Also, >5 months worth of expenses in a savings account at all times. I've worked some stressful jobs inside and outside of CS, and the peace of mind that comes with \"I can quit whenever I want and my family will not starve\" is priceless.

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.One benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.As for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.Driving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. The cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.On the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. TL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned. Truth be told, if my wife had an opportunity in Chicago and wanted to move closer to here family, I'd probably be excited about the move.",

Not consciously, they've been practicing *subconsicously* all their life. That's your competition. People who have literally been practicing all their life.So don't expect an overnight fix, but with some solid practice over time you can make some big improvements. Get outside. Talk to people. Meet some strangers, make some friends. Probably the biggest thing that's given me my soft skills are being a part of an organization, and eventually taking on a leadership role at that organization. I've been doing that since I was a kid all the way back to Boy Scouts. I joined a bunch of student orgs in college, some of which I was on the executive board of.So I'd recommend that, join one or two local organizations where you meet up with other people *in-person* at least once a week and be consistent with it.

And I get confused how we haven’t collectively realised that’s not how this works yet?Like they are anomalies in most cases because, if a business’s did keep bumping your pay to market rate they would lose profit. It’s literally why inflation exists. I employ you at market rate. (Once)I try keep you as long as possible because pay is gradual and the system tells you to stay for years. (Annual change 1 - 5%)Then I raise prices (annual change 5 - whatever works %)= margins go up. If I raise prices and my own costs (your salary) I would have to exceed inflation at a rate where customers/clients would leave.Edit:When I say I, I’m being figurative. I don’t own yours or any business. Incase that’s the cause of the silent downvotes",

You will inevitably be looked at by a few as a bad guy, that's just life. But if you know how to properly manage, people will defend you like crazy. I've run into people I used to manage that I hadn't seen in a decade come up excited to see me and wish me well and tell me how much I helped them. It's just about standing on your business, and being a good person. Being a good manager tends to take a lot of extra work over being a regular run of the mill manager. You need to be able to sus out your workers' primary strengths and weaknesses, help them with roadblocks, and effectively communicate to your superiors what realistic goals look like. Many managers just want to look good and will place unrealistic expectations on workers and delegate tasks they should be handling themselves given the workloads. TLDR, you can totally be a \"good guy\" manager, assuming your company isn't shit.",

        "body": "Unfortunately there probably aren't many options, especially with AI nowadays.There was a study released recently that even said CNC (Computer Numerical Control) programmers will be some of the first automated out of exiatence due to its rote, typical nature. Current AI probably can't automate the entire job, but within 5 years it definitely will. Unfortunately, IT is probably going to have salaries cut massively because of AI as well. More work will go to fewer specialists, and given that VCs and BoDs don't value IT as much as they should up until this point, that problem will get worse. I'd even say IT will probably become an hourly-wage job, with FTE reserved for those heavy hitters that got there before shit hit the fan.My recommendation would be cyber security. You have enough experience to justify FTE and probably know enough details to be able to excel at the role, both from a programmatic and aw technical standpoint. Those jobs simply cannot be automated away by AI anytime soon, as the role focuses on the security risks of code, regardless of where the code comes from. You'd need to complete a number of certifications and maybe reskill a bit for the basics, but that would be what I would say to a new grad or someone entering college right now. Edit: the downvotes represent people who are unwilling to see reality for what it is. AI is coming for all our jobs, by the simple fact that the billionaires (ya know, the people driving industry) are spending collective trillions to make it happen. In the immediate, our jobs will be taken, and offshored. In the future, the roles will simply disappear, more work to fewer people.",

The fact that you're getting to final rounds and acing technical portions means your skills are solid and companies recognize your talent. The issue isn't you - it's that there are hundreds of qualified candidates competing for every single position, and sometimes the difference between getting an offer and getting rejected comes down to factors completely outside your control.Taking the master's program isn't admitting defeat - it's making a strategic move to ride out this market downturn and emerge even stronger. You'll have more time to build projects, potentially get internship experience, and most importantly, you'll be graduating when the market has hopefully recovered. The skills you've built this year won't disappear, and the interview experience you've gained is invaluable. Your family supports you because they see what you've accomplished despite impossible odds, not because they pity you.I'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically because we know how challenging these technical interviews can be, especially when you're already dealing with the stress of a tough job market and need that extra edge to stand out among so many qualified candidates.",

What you’ve done going from blanking in interviews to actually acing them that’s real progress, even if it doesn’t feel like it.Taking the master’s doesn’t mean you “failed.” It’s just another path forward. It gives you more time, a stronger position for visas, and a shot at hitting the market when things aren’t so cutthroat.

I can only do this with select topics though. I tried learning Node this way and I didn't retain anything. I just had to get my hands dirty and build a bunch of small projects to understand that.",

You’re drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.Next, I’d focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it’s a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.Your employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it’s a niche industry, I’m sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven’t looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable. It might be worth reaching out to mentors in the industry to figure out your blind spots in terms of employability.Hope it works out, and remember, this too shall pass",

There is really no movement right now due to some policy things Cheeto Caligula is doing. Do be fair, I'm not at my best right now due to stress, and my coping mechanisms aren't working for once. I think the big thing I struggle with is that when they switched to doing daily huddles rather than bi-weekly project updates, it felt like every employee was getting grilled in their work and I've had to push stats to appease them that weren't true to keep the peace and then work weekends to make it up. I'll be honest about it, but I don't think that's going to save me.I get this feeling in my chest it's all going down hill and I can't peddle fast enough to prevent it.

That way, even if anxiety kicks in, you’ll have a mental “cheat sheet” to fall back on. Also, practice mock interviews in real time with peers or mentors getting reps in a simulated high-pressure setting can rewire that freeze response. If you want extra structure, some mentors specialize in helping candidates with anxiety and communication under pressure, which might give you the practice environment you need before the real thing.",

That's why it's called a \"job search\", you're searching for the right job.If you're barely getting interviews at all, and this startup was your 1 and only opportunity you've had in months, you'd be crazy to turn it down.It all comes down to how you're doing in your job search. There are people out there who have done hundreds of applications over the course of several months who would die for that chance. But there's also people out there that are getting interviews just fine that probably wouldn't bother.One thing I will add is don't make up your mind from online reviews. Always make up your mind based on first-hand evidence after talking with your hiring manager, and some SWE's you'd be working with. The reverse interview is the most important part of the interview.You never know, maybe the vibes you get from this startup are completely different once you actually talk to them. Things constantly change, especially in the startup world, and places like Glassdoor tend to attract people that have things to complain about so it always skews negative.One startup I was interviewing had a bunch of negative reviews saying it was a boys club, and if you weren't buddy buddy with the CEO you would never get good raises or promotions. When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions. I've had 2 of the biggest raises of my career at that company.So I'd encourage you at least humor it, and walk into it with good intentions. If when you speak to these people its as terrible as what you've read say, *then* you can reject them.",

I saw someone else say he’s becoming a high school history teacher (fully by choice, he loves history). I worked at a large contracting company for a little bit. They had a boot camp where they trained people, then tried to staff them. I want to warn you, don’t let your skills get rusty. They let everyone in the boot camp go (they were on the bench), then some opportunities arose months later due to some positions opening up. Basically every candidate bombed their interview. They had forgotten everything. People will talk about luck, but I think a huge portion of luck is being ready when those random opportunities arise. You’re trying to always put yourself in the best position possible. Good luck. It’s always OK to step away and take a break.",

The market was probably better when I got the job, but regardless, pursuing a career in tech is not automatically a lifetime sentence of unemployment. If I were asking myself the same thing today, given my experience so far, I’d say:- remember many of these articles are written to get attention and increase metrics for whoever published it- big tech companies and the tech industry in general do not represent the vast majority of the actual jobs you’re going to find- doesn’t matter what industry or career you end up with, you’re going to have to figure out how to cut through the demotivating and discouraging bs and realize the knowledge and experience you acquire for your career (whether by a degree or otherwise) is simply a set of skills you’ll always be developing over time to improve your “employability”; countless people have walked your path; and there is no cutoff date/circumstances for allowing more people into the field- identify your expectations and work on adjusting those rather than letting a job market always in flux dictate your life choices - for example, do you expect to graduate with a degree and immediately get a 6 figure job offer? If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you’re probably going to be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing more about what challenges you are likely to face (exposed by the discouraging articles and posts), you’ll be able to spend more time preparing to face them instead of just trying to hit arbitrary benchmarks you think should get you a job (such as leetcode grinding for x hours every day/week, knowing certain languages/frameworks, which degree you get, etc)Modal of the story - do you WANT to pursue this career path? If it was as “easy” to do as any other job you’re already qualified for, and paid at least a living wage, would you still want to do it? If the answer is yes, start thinking about the scary stories and predictions as clickbait and YOU DO YOU BOO",

If you’re not getting job experience (which feels like one of the only things on your resume that actually matters), I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all to start training for a potentially different field.Unfortunately though I’m not sure how much safer EE really is. EE has been plagued by excessive outsourcing the same as CS has for years. The nature of the work makes it easy to just outsource a specific project, get a working design and never talk to the designer again. Additionally I’m not convinced it’s immune to LLMs taking over, although it won’t happen as quickly as CS since it’s not just pure text that needs to be spit out. That said if you’re financially able to potentially work contract jobs or spend some time developing skills, it’s not that bad of an idea. I don’t want to discourage you cause I understand how you feel exactly, but there’s something to be said about working in a field you’re passionate about. On one hand it’s obviously more fulfilling, but on the other hand you risk burnout and losing something that could have been a lifelong hobby or passion. I work on electronics repair and stuff as a hobby with most of my free time. I don’t think it will ever turn out to be a job, but I don’t mind IT and it keeps me afloat.",

Back to the example, are you just asking how to center a div, or are you asking how to center a div in the containing element, because you tried adding spacers, but that didn't seem to work.Are you constantly asking about the same thing? If you asked how to center a div in the containing element yesterday, why can't you figure it out today?What's the overall situation? Is your mentor under a tight deadline for something else? If so, he might be short just because he has more pressing issues to deal with.Did you read the error? The error usually outright tells you what's wrong. And if not, it will provide clues as to where to look.Do you know your tools? Are your packages cached? Do you need authentication to access your company's package repository? Did you even install the dependencies? Some ecosystems download packages as part of a build, some don't.However, if you've covered the above, you *should* be good.

If you are a contractor as in, it's just you and the employer involved, then I think it's very unlikely there is anything in your contract that says \"it would be problematic if you came on board as an FTE\".However, if you mean you are a contractor at some large contracting firm like Telus International, and the contract is between them and the employer, then yes, there is very likely some clause in your contract that inhibits the employer's ability to hire you.Think of it this way: if you were a contracting firm, and you let your client companies effectively test drive all your employees and then hire away the best ones, you would very quickly find yourself with only the crappiest employees. So most of these employment contracts include language that prohibits or at least restricts in some way the clients' ability to hire employees of the provider company.",

Usually, there is a non-solicitation agreement in place to prevent clients of the firm from soliciting contractors (and to prevent you from soliciting anything from clients).Pay attention to the wording of any non-solicitation clauses, get help from an attorney if you're unsure whether accepting the job interferes with any of your existing obligations.Another perspective here: the consulting agency probably has very little incentive to take on costs to pursue legal action against you personally, even if they have cause for such action. It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.I was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500). I quit and didn't offer any details about where I was going next (just in case). There weren't any complications and I had a very successful career there for seven years.",

Liberal arts electives for easy A's were my salvation.>and supposedly EE can transfer into CS/ML roles with little resistanceThey sure can but ML is graduate degree stuff in CS, EE and Computer Engineering. Really PhD stuff but an MS may be acceptable. AI/ML is extremely overcrowded even by CS standards. Is a misconception that AI/ML has to be in CS. Computer vision and image sensing is very EE.The entire consulting industry will count EE as equivalent to CS. Two banks I worked for will also treat EE as CS. Problem is, CS got way overcrowded and HR gets lazy with 100+ applications in the first day and filters by CS degree. You have resistance that wasn't there 5 years ago.Other thing...there is hardship when I never had a course in SQL or databases, 1 in C++ and zero in anything using C#, Java or Python. EE is CS-lite. I coded in 1/3 of my courses, mostly in MATLAB and low level for microprocessors. Great for Embedded Systems but not general CS. So those are your two handicaps.",

We had to learn digital design, VHDL/Verilog (programming FPGA's), math-intensive electromagnetism and solid state eletronics courses. We also had to take CS courses like their Data Structures and Algorithms. And pretty much any EE or CS course counted as credit - whether you wanted to do databases or power systemsOur dedicated CompE courses were focused on embedded systems, Operating Systems, device drivers. Our freshman 100 lvl class taught us assembly/C. So basically we had the skillset to move down the stack (circuits, digital design) or higher (pure software).For example I ended up focusing on networking, which itself was a mix of EE (wireless networking, little programming more math), CompE (Linux networking labs), and theoretical CS stuff (routing protocols, distributed systems)",

In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.Half the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.On your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.Most jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory. The joke is you need 5 YoE in everything and it's not completely a joke.",

The summer is almost over and bigger companies will begin opening their 2026 summer internship roles. Start applying. Go to career fairs, school events, and as much as I hate it, cold network with the occasional LinkedIn recruiter. It works sometimes. Your opportunity to find an internship only expires when May 2026 hits, so literally just start right now. Internships are the best thing you can do as an undergrad.2. Projects. Yes, I always hated when people said that. 'Just learn'. Not that easy, especially when you get trapped in tutorial hell. Follow a couple of tutorials and then try to make something on your own. Go find a 'To-Do' list tutorial if you want to do web development, go find a course if there's something specific you want to learn.I didn't do anything...I mean ANYTHING until I was already a junior and I think I'm fine.

Im trying to sell that I'm a collaborative sharp thinker that's not afraid to clarify information. I lost some interviews because I did not clarify before I started solving stuff.You also want to be correct though. Something I did wrong was not asking \"do you mind if I take a minute or two to think?\" And just be quiet and focus. Ask questions and focus. Competitive programmer part. Unfortunately due to the time constraint, it's like a competition. You have to figure out how to make a MVP in a short time, and be able to explain how you would do more given more time. Making it work and covering general edgecadds and showing awareness of stuff you can't cover in 15-30 mins is probably what would of improved my odds. I practiced this by doing LC easies and timing myself for 10 mins.For the other code stuff. That one I couldn't find examples but what you could do is take an open source method that's doing like a REST request and read it over and try to explain what it's doing, then feed it to LLM after and see what they say.",

I joined in August. It was supposed to be renewed for January. By February, the client renewed, but they dictated a lot of new terms. It ended up being good for me. I moved to an internal team (still a contractor) rather than being on a contracting team. I was also at a small government contractor that similarly lied about contract state to people.

Now your ability to social with the team, appearance, hygiene (for some people), just showing up to business events is called into question. That’s before we get to the studies that show commuting even 40 minutes reduces job satisfaction significantly enough that you’d have to earn nearly double to be just as happy. With other studies from Sean Achors research on happiness that show the happier the staff, the more productive. So, what immediately happens is you’re more likely to fail onsite. Because you have to maintain a lot for your mood.If those things are ok, then you have to deal with those who struggle to socialise outside of work and tend to like the office from the social aspect. By that I mean, they think this is the place to get all their social fill and interrupt, talk about shit I don’t care about, gossip, and generally make the day worse purely for their own benefit. That’s if they’re not disrupting you, there’s equal studies from the nords on the open office plan being cancer for focus. Anyways, that’s how I feel about it. When you’re onsite, suddenly your requirements expand 10 fold. — worked remote for 8 years, also been on site for 8 years prior. That’s just my opinion though. Hope it goes well either way.Edit: format, and appending, then telling you they’ll make you manager doesn’t mean much. And for only 10k more? I dunno.

Good luck), you’re still finding remote roles paying way more than on site roles for people in LCOL, even MCOL areas. The only reasonable thing that I can conclude is that these on site companies are looking for desperate people, or warm bodies. Because they know they’d never get a talented senior who can get $160k in a remote role, offering $100k and mandating a daily commute.
