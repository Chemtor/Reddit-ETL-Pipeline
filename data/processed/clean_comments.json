With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.You had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen. I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based. So I can understand why 9 failed.You then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge. I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials. Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.But then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review. I find that odd that so many failed. Was it an experience issue with the tech stack. Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?Anything you would have wished gone different? I find the funnel here to be very lopsided. Do you think it would have been better to start with more than the 21 initial candidates?",

I had to ingest that data as if we were getting it in real time, we needed that simulation over the historic data that was divided into 4 sets of 75 GB chunks each. I used Kafka to stream each static dataset which was in a CSV format, while also collecting and performing feature engineering using Spark Streaming in realtime, passing it to a pre trained ML model that simulated classification in realtime. You can stream that data using Kafka, no memory issues, Spark streaming can handle all the known formatting issues, the ones that are not anticipated, can be sent into dead letter queues using Kafka. Then, at the end look at that data to understand why it failed, put all the newer checks and run an iteration again on those failed records. Dividing the data set into smaller chunks can definitely help like others suggested and also, someone suggested to do it using a terminal, that's a good one. Streaming seemed very useful and an out of the box idea to me during that hackathon as I was struggling to think how someone would process this big of data on RAM. I was fresh out of college then.",

That’s rare.* **Zero-Copy + Arrow Interop**: Shares memory with Arrow without copying — great for performance.* **Pushdown Compute on Compressed Data**: If supported, this is huge — filter/compute without decompressing.* **Forward-Compatible WASM Decompression**: You can ship a new encoding + its logic *inside* the file.* **Handles Ultra-Wide Tables**: O(1) access to 100k+ columns using FlatBuffers.# :cross_mark: What It Gets Wrong (or Needs Work)* **Still immature**: Tooling is limited. No wide adoption (e.g., no Spark/Presto/DuckDB support).* **Too complex for most**: Great for low-level devs, but not plug-and-play for typical data teams.* **IPC Format = WIP**: This is critical for streaming/cloud-native workflows — and it’s not finished.* **Limited language support**: Rust and Python are solid; Java/Go/Scala? Not there yet.* **No benchmarks vs Parquet/Arrow**: Claims are strong, but I want charts.# :balance_scale: Bottom LineVortex is **not** a Parquet replacement (yet), but it’s potentially **better** in specialized cases — like in-browser data tools, embedded systems, or custom DB engines.If you love performance and control, it’s worth watching.

My personal preference I Scala, although I'd probably recommend starting with Python as you'll see more materials online using this. In terms of getting hands on \"big data\", more difficult but not impossible. There are tons of open datasets that you can practice using Spark on. Check on Kaggle, lichess, Google Big query sample data (for this one you cna get Google credits then write out these large datasets to parquet then you are good).I have to say that Spark was quite intimidating when I started around 6y ago but there are a lot of good materials out there.Edit: you will require basic sql knowledge but I would learn this via Spark APIs eg. How to select columns, how to do various types of joins etc.",

The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.Also, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.If you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.You can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.For a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely. The books by Kimball on data warehousing are one of such \"bibles\".Lastly, you can consider proper schools. In my country, there are short courses by local polytechnics and universities for undergrads and post-grads, with substantial government subsidies on the course fees.",

If every build vs buy decision is automatically \"buy\" because the team doesn't have the ability to build, then you are going to end up with a complicated mess of integrations, configurations, and impedance mismatches between systems without clear boundaries of responsibilities.

Sure you can argue that the \"medallion architecture\" is just marketing crap rebranding an idea that's been in use for decades, but pre-aggregated data serves a vital purpose when you're serving data to analysts. Just off the top of my head:- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development. Do you really want them running a monster query with tons of joins repeatedly when you could just save compute by pre-aggregating the data for them?",

It still has millions and billions of rows, if you let business users or data analysts build aggregations and derive kpi's from it, then you'll end up with massive inconsistencies. I have also noticed where multiple teams interpret metrics in different way and that's an issue. Let's say, \"active customers\" which can have different meaning to different people.  Data is still normalized to certain extent in silver. It's really at gold layer where data is demoralized for fact tables. That's where you could take huge advantage of partitioning and clustering based on low cardinality fields like date.",

But this isn’t the big problem the author thinks it is. At my company, we treat both silver and gold as consumer-facing data marts. Silver is the atomic “business objects” (equivalent to fact/dim, but without the star schema). Then we have gold models for some pre-calculated/filtered/aggregated datasets, always using silver models. There’s really nothing wrong with this kind of structure and people who get all annoyed about “medallion” are just whining and straw-manning the topic to death.",

You can reduce the amount of data scanned by partitioning your data in S3 (if you have not). You can control the query limit in work group and also reuse the queries executed. I won’t say Iceberg is reinventing the wheel. It is complementing the use of using S3 as data lake. Athena is the query engine but with glue catalog alone, it cannot promise ACID properties of the glue tables. Iceberg, as an open table format helps to manage and maintain the metadata of the tables and handles schema evolution etc. Iceberg ensures the ACID behavior of the glue tables.",

M If youve got PowerBI youve got a cube.Its very rare for end users to need a \"super drill down\" of everything. Split your data model into smaller chunks each supporting a set of reports based on traditional user personas. You can use urls with filters embedded in the parameters to jump between different pbi reports connected to different models and have it feel like a slightly more clunky drill down Of course selling the business on this is the tricky thing. You probably want to turn this into a fight between cost sensitive executives and feature desiring business units. Executives entire life is getting business units to do more with less.\"Sure we can have your super dashboard at the price of one billion dollars, or your business units can give us specs for their common analysis and use cases and we can get you all that for 1 million dollars.\" \"When I hear we need everything what I am hearing is that you are not communicating and prioritising your biggest value adds.

We've seen tons of companies move from exactly your setup (PowerBI + expensive compute that runs 24/7) to ClickHouse and it usually works really well for retail drill-down scenarios (we have a very large retail customer at Tinybird doing exactly that - unfortunately I can't mention them by name).ClickHouse is that is quite literally built for this kind of workload - fast aggregations across massive datasets with arbitrary groupings. Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.A few things to consider though:1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?Druid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.I'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions. But yeah, this seems like exactly the kind of problem ClickHouse was designed to solve.",

I’ve completed over 70 customers data projects (often 1-3+ systems per project) averaging between 6 months and 18 months a project with some spanning multiple years. They’re vastly underestimated and require dedicated resources, which should include a project manager, business stakeholders, and engineer(s). The worst project? A migration with no validation, a lack of business user validation, and/or a rushed timeline. Projects without validation are almost always dead on arrival. The exception being an incredibly straight forward system (with low customization) that you’ve handled multiple times. I can tell within the first three months if it’s going to flop based on business users lack of engagement and/or validation. You could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions. Even something as simple as moving files is often overlooked in data migrations between systems, which can range from super straight forward PDFs to custom templates you need to rebuild by passing data into. File type compatibility issues, number of files per record and representation of those files on the front-end, file size limits, etc. The fact you’re doing migrations straight into production without validation rounds (using production data) raises a :triangular_flag:for a potential long term headache. Again, this is assuming these are complex systems and not a handful of tables. What’s worse than a bad migration?

So, there's no reason to try to appear more than you are at the moment. Approach them with some honest questions. You've already got the job and it sounds like you are producing at a level that is expected/acceptable. Go easy on yourself, and ask lots of questions about how you could improve your submissions, or ask about terms that are unfamiliar. Everyone starts at the beginning, and NOBODY learns EVERYTHING in school. Get to know them and you might find that they have some additional resources for you that are directly relevant to the kind of work you are doing. You may even find out that a few of them struggled in the beginning, just like yourself.If you don't want to get too personal, you could always just ask them directly about some of their favorite resources like books, YouTubers, or podcasts because you want to continue to grow. Also, keep posting here. Everyone wants to help and mentors are hard to find. If you don't already have a daily reader, I highly suggest the Confidence Gap on audible. I feel like most of what it says is blatantly obvious but helps to hear it come from someone else. There's some tips in here about imposter syndrome and it might ease your conscience a little bit.",

It encourages knowledge gaps and creates a weird time dysphoria. Your work starts getting done pretty quickly, and you know that you don't quite know the material yet. But there's no time to study because you've submitted work and now there is more work on your plate. Then, you try to do something yourself without the llm and find out that there is no way you can possibly learn the material and submit your work before the work is due. OP Will have created an unachievable time frame for submitting work. However!! I think that you're downvotes are a little bit unfair. I absolutely believe that OP can learn a lot from LLMs. There is however, a responsible and ethical way to go about it. In order not to create a weird time dysphoria and knowledge gaps OP still needs to be the one producing the work. LLMs make a great research and reference tool for anyone looking to learn a new skill or improve upon the skill they already have. The trick is to ask better questions. Stop worrying so much about how to get your task done and instead ask why it should be done a certain way. Get deeper with the strategy of approach. Write the code yourself, and ask it for a critical review based on your goals. \" What have I missed?\", \" am I using best practices?\", \" what does it mean to have traceability?\"These are all questions that an LLM can help clarify and fill the knowledge Gap. OP needs to learn the language, so they can communicate with the senior developers in a productive way. Anyway, I gave you an upvote so that hopefully your comment is seen and taken seriously. It was very positive and encouraging.",

Am guessing vba? Why not make these transformations using sql?Great job!

        "body": "Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.Again, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",

A much more interesting discussion around this is how the AI boom is basically keeping the (American) economy sustained; how we’re on the verge of data center infrastructure bubble bursting similar to the telecom bubble the late 90s; how we’ll have trouble feeding electricity to all these new data centers and how electricity prices will continue go up because of that and because policy makers are putting the brakes on renewables; how all this new AI tech is amounting to little more low quality slop being generated at an unprecedented rate and we’re essentially stuck with it forever.

The title is clickbait, the content is feeble, and the whole premise is weak. Regular CS fundamentals are not going anywhere and will always be a core element of computing.

Where a Project/Product Manager meets with stakeholders and then turns around and delivers clear requirements to engineers? Where it doesn't spiral into an endless game of telephone or where the engineers don't just cut the PM out of the process and gather the requirements themselves? Honestly asking here. I've almost always seen some version of number 1. But letting users \"blue sky\" things can be troublesome no matter what. I usually try and anchor the conversation in tangible reality: \"How are you getting the data now? Is there a native report inside the tool? Have you used something in the past that delivered this? What was it?\" If there's something that already exists that can serve as a starting point and provide a common understanding that can greatly ease the process.

        "body": "I'm a TL in Data Engineering.Reading your sample github, I would:- Trust you to write some functions- Trust you to follow an existing architecture, with existing code to use as examples to copy/paste- Put you on \"write the code\" tasks for solutions designed by more senior contributors- Expect you to learn from our mediors in the team- In the job interview, put (neutral, non-aggressive, heavy technical) pressure on depth of data engineering knowledge that I expect you wouldn't have (and that I don't expect/need you to have), to test whether you respond in honesty (\"I don't know\") or in ego (anger, frustration)- Have an opening as a Junior (to potentially grow fast into Medior), depending on results/connection with the team/willingness to learn/honestyI would not:- Trust that you can write code without AI (worsened by [this file](https://github.com/mrpbennett/etl-pipeline/blob/main/src/api.py) of yours that has its import header duplicated, with a typical \"# Rest of the code...\" marker that AI sometimes does)- Trust you in your contributions with full independence/autonomy- Trust you with business-critical parts that require domain knowledge- Trust you to come up with an architecture- Trust you with processing of any significant volume, where simple python functions would be way too slow to use, or any part where multi-node processing is involved- Trust that you have deep knowledge of statistics, especially domain-specific ones (which can be okay, specialized members of the team will give you the formulas to implement in this case, just something to be mindful of)- Expect you to be able to give pipeline estimations or guarantees (SLAs, min/max guarantees for performance/timing/efficiency/hardware resources for a new process you're implementing)I would probably set my expectations for you as a Junior while you get started, with some general programming knowledge but no experience in data engineering, in the hopes that I can see you demonstrate Medior expertise after learning what you're missing from our mediors.Your github sample project shows general coding skills, not data engineering experience. And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).If you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.If, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.Pay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.----tl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself. You've never worked in this field, it's not appropriate to have expectations. Become a student again. Focus on learning the needs of the role, not on yourself / your self-doubt / your perception of yourself.",

Interview hiring managers, explain your intention in your career path for the future, ask what technologies they're hiring for.Identify 2 or 3 real, long-term careers that way (one technology = not a career), learn only that specific thing/career (nothing else matters), maybe get certified for it (optional), and interview for junior/medior positions while being honest about your career path and skills.Learn only what matters for that specific position. Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.Find yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.I would say \"that's it\", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.But the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",

The shift toward treating data infrastructure more like software has been one of the biggest changes I've seen over the past few years.I think the \"data is too messy\" argument is kinda missing the point though. Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.The schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general \"data as code\" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.The local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.I guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges. Like CI/CD for data pipelines needs to handle things like data quality checks, schema validation, backfill strategies etc that traditional software CI/CD doesn't really deal with.",

Treat S3 as the \"immutable log\", partition by table then ingest date and hour using the Debezium event time ts\\_ms, and write Parquet with reasonable file sizes so Redshift can scan fast.In Redshift, instead of the sink, optionally, you can create an external table over staging for cheap ELT, then build a deduped view or table by using row\\_number over partition by primary key ordered by ts and the Debezium op so you keep the latest non delete.If you need a current table for BI, schedule a merge from that deduped view into a skinny current table with sort key on the primary key and updated\\_at. This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.Do you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?If you opt for the \"zero-ETL\" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.Dedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete. Partitioning matters for both Spectrum pruning and for batch merge windows, so compact small stuff like five minute files into larger hour files.Alternatively, if you want a no fuss route, Estuary can land CDC into Redshift with append only and handle dedupe and merges cleanly.

Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.Here are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.Start with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll. This avoids full refresh while staying honest about data quality. roughly how many employees and what rate limit do you have, do you need SCD2 history or is last write wins fine, and how should deletes be represented in the warehouse?",

Easiest setup, no need to find duplicates or changed values. Daily rewrite of all employee data shouldn't be too bad. If there are limitations or API is really slow then you can fetch only new employees data daily and all data weekly, for example. You can used ID to figure which employees you already have.Slowest API I'm currently fetching data returns 5000 rows with one query and it takes little less than minute.

Log-based CDC solves that but yeah, the tooling is mostly built for full-on streaming pipelines, not lightweight batch.There's a couple open-source options like `mysqlbinlog` or libraries like `go-mysql` and `maxwell`, but they’re super low-level. You end up writing a lot of glue code just to get something usable. Some folks hack together scripts that tail binlogs, write them to disk, and then batch-load into analytics systems, but that’s pretty fragile long-term.Are you pushing this into a warehouse? How often do you need fresh data? And how complex are your schemas (lots of deletes/updates or mostly inserts)?For what it’s worth, I work at Estuary, and we actually do log-based CDC (including MySQL binlogs) but abstract all the hard parts away. It’s more like “click to connect” and you get real-time or batched syncs with very little to manage. Kind of like Fivetran but way more flexible and with a transparent pricing.",

Keeping all that infra running just to read binlogs in a small team setting didn’t feel worth it.One project I recently came across that sits right in this middle ground is OLake. Instead of going full streaming, it can just read from MySQL/Postgres logs in a more batch or micro batch oriented way - like you schedule a sync job with Airflow or cron or they even have temporal integrated in their UI offering, and it picks up exactly what changed. No \"updated\\_at\" hacks, no Kafka clusters.Couple of things I liked about it:* It talks to the binlogs directly, so correctness is better than column-based filtering.* You can still run it in “batch or micro-batch” mode, so you don’t have to keep another service always-on.* It writes data straight to open formats like Iceberg or simple parquets in object store, so downstream analytics feels natural.It’s open source and lightweight (basically a Docker container you can run anywhere), so might be worth a peek if you’re looking for that sweet spot between *timestamp columns* and *full streaming infra*.Repo here if you want to poke around → [https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake)",

Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.I personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. The medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. You architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. With that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. One last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",

We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.That's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.Maybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.As far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.That being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.However, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like \"I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?\" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.For example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.Having said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as \"bronze\" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.For your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an \"analytics\" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",

The simplest approach without knowing your tooling, level of effort available, number of users/pipelines/reports would be to create a report that keys off a table holding runtime information for your different data pipelines.An easier way would be to have the dataset name (meaningful to the analysts), the runtime datetime, expected interval, and is_stale flag set to 0 or 1 if the last updated + interval is greater than the current datetime. You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. If analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale. This will depend on your analysts tooling though and if they’re viewing raw data, using bi tools, etc. You could also use something as simple as an email group with email notifications when pipelines fail. I don’t recommend this personally, but it might be quick if you need this done fast.",

Therefore we also have a third one, which is a subset of the snapshot but only with active users, so we can maybe get it down to 30% of the size.So in joins - we join on the date and userid with the transactional and then use the snapshot (with active users) as a fallback on date -1 if there were no changes on the day we process.This has reduced the data scanned massively and also improved performance in all measures.Edit: typos",

I am sorry if I cannot explain it that good `what practical or business needs require a report that only needs to be updated once per month`Right. I am new to the job and this is a report requested from me by the team lead. We handle ecommerce websites and we want to determine the placements of the products on home page and best selling items section depending on the last month and last year's sales. Home page items are the most popular items and the best selling products are the top performers in revenue -- they could have some overlap.The once-per-month refresh is only on this report alone, but the rest of the reports being asked are all standard.",

        "body": "You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. I have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. As an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.What of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.If revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.Overall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them. Otherwise, you are in for a world of pain.",

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. Comment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. Example: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. Whereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",

On one hand, you will have access to unlimited opportunities, use cases and business problems you can take on and go after yourself. On the other, you’ll find yourself cursing alot due to persistent frustration while this rocket wobbles all over the place. I tend to describe working at a startup as “an unlimited buffet”. You CAN eat until you throw up. But you must love the interim experience upto the point of throwing up in the metaphor. In terms of learning and growth, don’t expect someone to hold your hand, or build you a structured learning path or tell you what to do or how to do it. YOU are going to be doing all of that for yourself. Lastly, you will need to have a very high tolerance for frustration and lack of documented information, well defined standards and processes, crystal clear priorities and just pain overall. If you get frustrated easily because the business requirement wasn’t clear for you to immediately start coding your data pipeline or SQL query, then startups aren’t a viable place to work for you. Having said all of that, you WILL NOT find a more buzzing, lively and exciting opportunity to work and learn. It’s the same kind of thrill people get when going on those super risky rides, knowing that you might fall from the sky but the adrenaline rush of doing one is rewarding enough to go for it.

I haven't yet read the former but am reading through the latter. It's definitely a complicated book as it greatly goes into detail on different paradigms and applications. In fact, it may be a bit too dense too soon; either beforehand, or as they arrive, I would also look into tools that are similar to what your company is using. Learn what the differences are and try to understand why one may have decided to go with your current stack, and why one might want to move away from it.Lastly, for now, I stress paying attention to soft skills. I've been burned before being the only person at a start-up (kinda, it was complicated and I was largely separated from anyone else who may have been able to help, and they have largely different priorities). My boss had certain expectations that were tough to realize, partly because of these different priorities. I could've done better to manage them, to an extent.

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. The other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",

Raise your concerns to leadership in a constructive and empathetic way. You know everyone wants to just move with velocity, but you’re concerned that it comes at the cost of reliability and will not scale. Your data points are X, Y, Z. You’re experience in the past that supports this is ABC. You can use the aforementioned example but need a concrete data point how it’s caused problems or slows down the team. Do not bikeshed on it, despite the universal urge to do so that we all feel and can relate to. Then move on and focus on delivering what leadership expects of you.

You highlighted my exact concern, bringing this up in the regular meetings is basically pointing a finger at someone and that's not my intent but right now is the best time to fix this as we just redesigned and I don't know how much is dependent on it yet. Unfortunately the people id have to pull in to answer those questions wouldn't consider it a priority. I took this job to learn about organizing, culture and workflow of larger teams and unfortunately it's been more frustrating than educational. By the time the problems get to the devs it's far too late to do anything about it, I really wish we could have useful design reviews but that was something I was hoping to learn at this job. I know how to do all this on small teams where you just communicate, not so much when trying to essentially automate different teams workloads and getting them to fit together nicely",

Large Language Models use randomness in their response generation anyway, so there's a good chance this will give you some results in the case of a minor error. Just make sure you clear the LLM's cache if necessary so that it doesn't always give you the same result for a given input. More advanced approach would be to include the error message and the previous iteration of the pyspark code along with the repeated request. Yest more advanced approach would be to store error logs to disk and use those to generate some sort of repair prompt to be used in case of errors.Most important thing is to remember that if you've been doing any of these for more than five or six iterations and it still isn't working for you, that you're wasting time and should just write the code yourself.",

Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.Aside from that, this requires a mindset shift. As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, \"what jobs am I good enough for?\" which eventually devolved to \"will I ever be good enough?\".The cycle is this - you apply for jobs. You get nothing back - you go away and improve your existing code, take another look at your CV/resume, you continue learning.

Airbyte’s better on cost, but the managed version still needs care, and self-hosting isn't hands-off at all.Debezium is great when you want full control, but yeah, it needs a ton of infra and Kafka knowledge. Also, some ERP sources (like SAP) can be messy with Debezium or even unsupported directly, so you'd need to extract from a staging DB anyway.What kind of latency are you ok with? And do you have any infra budget or internal support for CI/CD pipelines? Also curious if you're planning to land the data in Delta Lake or use something like Synapse?FWIW, Estuary handles CDC with minimal setup and works well with most of your stack (Oracle, Salesforce, etc), and you don't need to run any infra. I work there, so obviously biased, but it’s been great for hybrid teams that want CDC without becoming experts in it.",

Also across reddit I find questions being asked by a user with almost no activity and responses from a SaaS company pretty quickly which feels like staged promotions.I don't know that I've learned anything from the communities I follow on Reddit related to tech in quite some time.

Most companies won’t expect miracles from you in your first role (assuming you are young - early 20s or less). So I’d say most important is what you bring to the role, good attitude, energy and an openness to learning and developing skills. Like mentioned before, be proactive in understanding how the product or application (s) you are working on really works. Sketch the data pipelines, the tech stack and how they fit in together. Talk to seniors when you have questions. Identify areas that are bottlenecks, have legacy systems and that can be improved. Try not to change large blocks, but find small things you can improve. This will give you confidence to do bigger things. Reading books and doing courses are okay, but you learn most by solving real problems. So always focus on finding problems and solving them.

You can use a custom encoding fine tuned on task specific output layers but 99% of the vibe coders don’t know this.2. OCR works great if you use the right OCR. Cloud based OCR APIs from Azure, AWS, Google. All can be set up securely and are 10-100x cheaper than LLMs.3. Find the right tool. Look into successors of LayoutLM specifically built for charts. Though at the end of the day this is a hard problem and most likely an XY question type ask.If this really is the client’s data and they’re not scraping charts from some other data source, why can’t you just recreate the charts with their data? If they are scraping charts from other places, are they able to extract the raw SVG or similar vector format? If you can get the raw vectorized image you can pull out the information manually without AI.",

Links will be dependent on the same natural keys that your sats / hubs are dependent on but all hashes should be built independently. That is one of the primary benefits of a data vault / hashed key approach, all tables can be built in parallel. This compares to e.g. traditional Kimball approach where you must generate the identity keys on the dim and then join to reference then in the fact.The only dependency you would have is if e.g. a link table joins e.g. 2 source systems, the source data from both systems must be loaded before you build the link table to ensure you represent the complete relationship.",

        "body": "Hi u/ephemeralentity , thanks for your reply! **Why birdges?**\\- You are absolutely right about link tables being able to fulfill that purpose. Yet, there are situations in where we find a bridge better as it displays our normalized world better. However, i do believe you are right in that you can make simple links for everything (so we got lazy i guess). For example:\\- A \"budget\" is not something on itself, it's a concept that only lives in the combination of a cost center, a account and a date (you can also choose to do this on year/month etc). As cost center, account and date are all individual objects on itself you will not include these values within the sat of budget but rather will include their keys in the link table of budget. Budget in this essence will be a bridge table (it doesn't exist without either one of these three). Of course one could argue to just make budget a hub/sat combination without considering why it exists in the first place. That way, one could probably kill all bridges.\\- On the other side, we do got lazy sometimes in that we find it convenient to make bridges as we blow up our database schema with link/sat tables (like 6 combinations for 3 associations). Maybe we should put effort making deployments faster?**Link tables and keys from 2 objects**Let's say we have cost center and business unit. Both are individual objects so both have a hub/sat, resulting in the following:1- Cost Center (primary key = hash of costcenterid (costcenter id is the id column from the source system table we have as a landing table in this example).2- Business unit (primary key = hash of businessunitid (businessunit id is the id column from the source system table we have as landing table in this example).Now, we know each cost center belongs to 1 business unit (and a business unit can have 1 to \\* cost centers). We decide to make a link table for that association and need to load: 1) the hash of cost center (as in example 1), 2) the hash of business unit (as in example 2) and the hash of those two keys that represent their relationship/will be the pk of the link table. This is the exact situation we are trying to tackle. We don't want to hash the key again from the source system (as we already did in example 1 and 2). We are trying to set some kind of list that holds all keys so we can reuse them in situations like this without the need of hashing them again. In that list one can then see how the key is built up (in cases of composites that might come handy when mapping to a link). I'm not sure if this will be faster than just hashing again separately (as one needs to join the keychain). Writing this, it might be even more efficient to make something that just stores how each key is build as it forces some consistency (for example, whenever a object has 30 links, you want to make sure each time the key is constructed the same way).Sorry for my mind dump.Greetings",

You can define the hash definition centrally in the staging view layer (as code logic) and then your downstream hub / sat / link tables are just subsets of the columns you need + the additional metadata column required for those tables.If you use dbt this is quite easy to generalise and manage as (a) you get good lineage / traceability from landing / bronze to staging views to DV layer, and (b) your hub / sat / link table definition can be generalised with macros which will automatically create the metadata columns based on the table output type you indicate, so you don't need to define each column individually.We built a custom version of this for one of our clients, but you can also leverage open source solution like: https://automate-dv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/If you're using a spark environment (e.g. Databricks/Fabric) you could also look at writing generalised pyspark functions that achieve the same objective, although I think using dbt would be cleaner and less custom.I'm still not too sure what you mean by keychain but I would avoid any solution that involves centrally writing and looking up hash values based on values precalculated in a table as this against the parallelism / scaling that's fundamental to DVs.If you have situations where you need multiple levels of processing / calculation to achieve a reporting requirement (e.g. calculating trial balance from general ledger based on very specific rules), then you can do that in information/data mart downstream of your DV as staging tables ending in dim / facts. Data Vault should be just about loading data with history tracking into a business entity relationship DV model as quickly/simply as possible. A certain degree of code repetition is unavoidable and a trade-off that you make for being able to load everything in parallel.",

The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values. * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows. * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred. For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year? All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT. * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns * etc, etc, etc, etcFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",

The recommended approach is to perform the transformation and insertion entirely within Glue: first, read the source data from S3 into a Glue DynamicFrame, then apply any necessary transformations using PySpark, and finally write the results back to the target S3 location in the correct format (e.g., Parquet).

It's not a hobby project, so I would build it properly from the start rather than needing to migrate in the future.Are you particularly familiar with k8s? I wouldn't go that route until you need it, ClickHouse is incredibly simple to start with a single EC2, and then add another when you need it. Use S3 for storage - queries will be minimally slower, but your storage redundancy is \"free\".",

It doesn’t happen often but maybe they move a column around that does have historical data tied to it. If not then maybe this will work for youI learned to distrust Airbytes historical loading along time ago and instead wrap each Airbyte raw table with a dbt snapshot.With this approach you can alter the start date of the api calls (I forget if hubspot has it but I would guess so) and only retrieve a reasonable amount of historical data. The snapshot would allow for merging any changed historical data. I regularly prune out the airbyte raw tables to keep the normalization step from becoming a time bomb.

It's a broad field, so the possibilities are pretty wide open.The good news is that you have solid data science experience, which demonstrates your Python chops and problem-solving abilities. Focus on showcasing those skills. Review the basics of REST APIs, common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and how to work with JSON data in Python. Even a quick refresher will help you discuss these concepts intelligently. If you get stumped, talk through your thought process and explain how you \\*would\\* approach the problem if you had more experience in that specific area.

Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. Source connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. Debugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT. It also supports JMX out of the box.The real problem is that many connector plugins are not open source (for example the ones from Confluent), so you have to rely on documentation and forums.",

What you can try to do on your local machine is setup a Postgres or MySQL whatever database, and install confluent Kafka. From there, set up a source connector that reads the latest inserts into a table and into a Kafka topic. And then after that, set up a sink connector to read from that topic and put it in another table. If you want, you can even practice doing some data manipulation in your config files as well. This is just a simple flow for Kafka connect that you can get to work on your own machine. Kafka Connect is simply a json file that you deploy to do all the easy pub and sub for you",

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. I'd recommend looking up some videos which will explain this much better than I can. Take a look at some blog post etc. just generally get a few viewpoints and explanations as to what it is.Generally, you develop code for your application locally and then it runs somewhere else on a schedule. So, you have to get your code over to the location where it runs. The process for most workflows is develop on your machine -> push to a branch/repo -> submit pull request to main -> deploy to where it runs. This is a CI/CD process.To avoid it getting too complicated, your CI/CD process is likely going to be as simple as branching off main -> making changes -> pushing to your remote branch -> pull to main -> auto publishing main -> schedule application via Github actions.This is assuming you're familiar with git and source control. If not, this is a great opportunity to learn.",

Or time travel (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/time-travel), but that's more manual. If sticking to Spark, your best bet is likely to leverage its \"time travel\" too: (https://delta.io/blog/2023-02-01-delta-lake-time-travel/) But you've gotta manage what timestamps to query each table as of, which can be a pain.",

There are plenty of ways to add additional capabilities, for example the different serdes for file formats. And you can bring in different libraries from the jvm.

What kinds of lists are there? What kinds of sequences? Come up with some lists and sequences. Spend some time trying to get as varied as possible. Then after doing that, explore how programming uses lists and sequences. Explore what a code is. Then think about the connection between why programming is called coding. What does that have to do with lists and sequences?This I think most people can handle. Then I might introduce arguing. How do you make points? What makes a point a good point?

        "body": "I think it might be a little bit of a misunderstanding to hear different programmers experiences about their work hours and relate that to their efficiency as a programmer. Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.With that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.**Become a master of your debugging tools**Knowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.**Find the true requirements**Don't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.**Code isn't always the answer**To a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.Remember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.**Cut out the distractions**Yeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.**Collaborate**I wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.**Take breaks**After so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well. When you're in a healthy state your brain will function better.",

        "body": "It’s not really about motivation. Motivation is fickle — it shows up sometimes, vanishes other times. If you get it, treat it as a bonus, not your main engine. What actually keeps you moving is discipline and consistency. Make a schedule, stick to it, and just keep showing up.Here’s the thing: once you stop, it’s surprisingly hard to come back — even if you used to love coding or learning before. That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.Also, a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.All these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong. Sometimes one carries you, sometimes another. But they only start working for you once you actually start and keep going. You might feel like some of these things don't apply to you but they will in their due time when you are at it.",

It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. You need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).You can pass a Japanese test and technically \"know\" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. If you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the \"studying\" and \"learning\" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. Speaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.And \"i can't build anything yet\" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say \"hello\", day one of a coding course you learn how to say \"Hello World\". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print \"something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? If you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than \"Hello World\" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. Coding isnt hard. But it takes practice. You've studied, thats great, but you need to put the books aside and go to the gym and get some reps in.",

        "body": "I would say if you copy paste it’s bad. This may be a controversial opinion, but I believe that it can actually help to copy if you retype what you see. Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.So if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. Eventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. At its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. If you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself. But if you copy paste you’re mostly not learning.",

You don't need to collect languages. They come and go (from your mind) easily. What does \"finished C\" and \"doing C++\" mean to you? You learn the syntax and semantics of a language to *use* it. If you've put effort into learning some C, you should write some software in it. You'll retain very little unless you do. It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...As for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).In summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C. Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more \"lower level\" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn. Not essential, I believe, but useful. I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.As far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy. Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language. With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system. But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post. I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language. The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C. Sounds like what you're interested in. C++ is not C, but I suspect that you might be able to use C++ for those problems as well and get some similar out of it. Hope that helps.",

You might even find you enjoy tinkering.Always try and do MORE than what the Labs ask. Lab might say do \"X\" and maybe you are finished with a week or so left? Spend that time refining it. Play around, get creative. Goldplate it (which means do extra). This happens in the real world, we refine our code (or iteration).Do PROJECTS. Focus on your Git skills. Learn topics not studied in classes. You have no idea how many new grads we get who don't even now how to merge or what rebase means which leads us to declining them.Work with friends on silly projects. Silly little projects lead to exponential gains as you learn from each other. Do code reviews of each others Labs. Maybe Dave knows something Bob doesn't, so Dave can let Bob know of this and now Bob knows this and he can pass that knowledge onto others. This way you learn of branching, merging, rebasing and the rest to keep your branches up to date with others.You can make friends with your teachers, because guess what? They were just like you. You never know what kind of insight they can give you.Always ask questions. Something doesn't make sense? Who cares if its a silly question, you are PAYING to be there.For reference:When I was in school, I took 7 classes a semester and still practice coding 2-3hrs a night. It seems like a lot, 2-3hrs? \"are you kidding?!\" No. 2-3hrs is so small, you might not even get any code written while you are learning how to, for example: API REST points for a silly CRUD app.My friend group which was roughly \\~7 of us, all code reviewed each other, would hang out in Skype (oh god I'm old) and just do silly little things. We would all work on projects (not all 7 at the same time) and we would knit pick each other, say \"man this is stupid, do it this way\".Not only will you make friends, you are all uplifting each other, and you will all succeed because that group work is more beneficial in skill than working on a Lab in your class.BUT MOST OF ALL?Have fun.

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.Universities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. I took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.Anyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. I wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language. One of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",

Any large enough codebase is very arcane at first. At a job, you have team mates that can help you make sense of it. You know you understand the code when you start to see what could be changed.That being said, there are actual practices that can be part of the team style that will result in messy and unreadable spaghetti given enough time. The thing where you said ”we just override stuff in CSS” rings some alarms in my head, but it all depends on how and why things are overridden. Are you overriding stuff because they were defined inside a library code? Could be good, you don’t want to modify anything inside the node_modules folder, and you being weirded out by it is just inexperience. Are you constantly overriding whatever the previous css was and now you have 5 classes that aren’t used anywhere? Really bad, your whole css packbcould be a giant mess.About the JS being hard to trace and split every where… it’s also really hard to infer if you are right or wrong here without looking at the codebase you are criticising. Keep in mind you haven’t sent it all yet, and sometimes, once you see the logic and decisions that are behind a certain way they organized their files, what looks messy to you now becomes manageable. Large code bases will take time to grasp even with a team that can guide you thru it.With the tutorials…. Are you really looking for ”how to make an endpoint” or are you still looking for ”how to create the thing in my head exactly”? Here’s the deal: authentication: that’s an endpoint. ORMs: do you understand what and ORM is? You can build endpoints without databases, but for a project that DOES something useful, it rarely makes sense to do so. And with databases come a lot of boilerplate that you have to code every time but really would rather not…I understand the desire to study things separately, but a lottor tutorials mash things together because they make sense together. Keep in mind that in the simplest form, an endpoint is just an ”URL” that sends you back something specific. You can make just send ”hello” back, or some hard coded object and not setup a whole database and ORM for it. That however, teaches you about endpoints, but not exactly why you’d want to use an endpoint for. Now if I slap authentication into it…. I’m teaching you not only ”using endpoints for authentication is common”, but also how to do it in an ok way, and that you probably dont want anyone accessing a database without authentication. There’s a chance here the tutorials you are watching aren’t great. A 2minutes tutorial really barely has time to show some very specific example, let alone explain the reasons for anything. I can recommend blue collar coder tutorials. He will explain why he’s doing this thing this way, so later you can decide for yourself if his approach works for your project or not.The deeper you go and the more knowledgeable you are, the less tutorials will help you. Once you dive into advanced enough territory, there’s no ”find a video who shows me how robust this library in this way”. You either have to find tutorials that fit for parts of what you want to do, like how do I use this specific ORM or dive into docs and leave tutorials behind altogether.",

Learn core CS skills like data structures, algorithms, and databases alongside practical tools (Python, JavaScript, Git, Linux).Networking helps too, join online communities, contribute to open source, or even attend local meetups if possible. Internships and side projects will matter way more than your school’s name when applying later.Keep consistent and treat it like a marathon, by the time you graduate, you’ll have a portfolio that speaks louder than your uni’s reputation.",

First thoughts is I need to have two sets of words, I need to display them and I need to take input. Maybe a database? A gui? Do I know any database? No, okey... do I know any gui? No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?This never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.GUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first. Solve it \"yourself\" as much as possible first because many 3rd party software is not helpful for you yet. They are complicated and huge because they can handle so much.. add them later.Wordlist? Hardcode it, then use csv or json. Same as above, switch when it is more work not switching.The app prototype is done and now you have a much better chance of planning anything or finding answers.Don't be afraid to write bad code.

It’s always A4 and it’s always small grid boxes so that I can keep straight lines. It’s always done in black gel pen now that’s just my system but I do recommend finding a way of drawing it out ahead of time because it’s easier to change drawing and to see it then than to start writing Code and not knowing where you’re going with it",

The vast majority of people who get a degree in either one of those fields go into exactly the same role, which is often called \"software engineer\" but might be \"web developer\" or something else depending on the company.Either major will prepare you for a career in the field.Both degrees are foundational and NOT job training. If you want to get a job in the field you'll have to spend a lot of time practicing and self-teaching also, in addition to what you learn in school. Internships are highly recommended.CS is simply an older degree. It's more theoretical and more mathematical than SE, but you still do a lot of coding in both.",

It's a package manager that uses a project.toml file to create a lock file and make a venv for you and checks and installs versions that fit all library requirements.3. Uv. It's another package manager like poetry but imo is easier to setup, and faster. Does the same thing as poetry but just better in most cases I've found.Other languages usually have built-in tools (npm for nodejs, and cargo for rust) or have 3rd party tools (yarn for nodejs) that manage this stuff for you.You can always just build a .venv yourself but you generally have to track package versions yourself and ensure compatibility.",

(I joke, I like Rust overall).Once you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).I much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \\*/& etc.) too.Rust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.There are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.TLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while. It can be used to write fast, robust native software. I use ripgrep, fd, every day.",

You can look into libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or even simple transformers for beginner chatbots. Robotics also leans on Python (with frameworks like ROS).My advice: Pick one area to focus on first (web or AI/robotics) so you don’t get overwhelmed. For videos:• FreeCodeCamp’s full-stack web tutorials (React + Node)• Sentdex’s Python/AI tutorials on YouTube• Corey Schafer for Python deep dives.You don’t have to “choose perfectly” right now — just follow what excites you most and you’ll naturally pick up skills that transfer across areas.",

Feel free to google those keywords yourself, but to start you could look at Vue.js for your frontend, Python’s Flask for your backend, and a NoSQL option like Firebase’s Firestore for your database.Alternatively, if you plan on running the website off of your computer, you could straight up just use file storage on your device as the database with CSV, JSON, or XML files.Explaining how all of these parts work together up front would turn this into an essay, but for reference I have not worked with web technology, HTML/CSS/JS, or Python in over a year and I have a solid prototype web app up and running after only a week (40hrs) of development time. All it takes is a lot of googling and some patience. You don’t need to know the entirety of each language to get this up and running, honestly just start developing and learn as you go.PS: please do not attempt to use AI to make this whole thing for you. It will make up functions that don’t exist and do many other incorrect things and the end result will be you bashing your head against a wall wondering why your website doesn’t work. Read docs, stack overflow, etc and attempt to figure out what is actually going on.",

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.First start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. After doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know. At that point you'll have some experience and you can look to helping out in larger and larger projects.It's not a fast process, but I've found it rewarding so far.",

For example, I didn't really \"get\" the quadratic equation until a teacher did a proof of it, so I could see how to get there from what I already knew.The other big way to connect new concepts to existing understanding is through analogy, but different people have different existing knowledge to connect to. For example, most math students wouldn't be helped if you said \"domain is the set of all valid arguments for a pure function, and range is the set of all valid return values\". In your case, though, that may be a useful analogy. So for the function: int.ToString(), the domain is all integers from - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and the range is the set of all strings that match the regex \"\\-?\\d{1,10}\"",

Even if the database in question uses some other query language (Neo4j uses a special language to query graphs called Cypher, Mongo uses a specially crafted JSONs, etc) the ideas for data selection and aggregation are often transferrable between them. So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.Another one such \"language\" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.Learning Shell scripting is my third recommendation. Learning how to combine programs together, build pipelines, learning SSH tunneling - all of this will be useful over decades, too.A large pert of programmer's work is spent outside of their primary language, so getting comfortable with the world besides `if`s and `for`s is always a good idea.",

These roles are always undervalued and under represented in big team projects in university and schools. Some people might partake in this role, but usually the team doesn’t take the role seriously. But that is usually the way it is with product managers - they have to make themselves useful, so that the team can see the purpose in the role.Even though you can’t code, I’m sure that’s a lot of things that you’ve caught on about - use that knowledge to support the team in every possible way. Communication is key - as it is in any successful endeavor.But you won’t learn enough in a month - it is simply not enough time.But if you do choose to study hard and try to make lost time, here’s a few suggestion for you:Stop focusing on fancy called examples or guides from people that tell you that this kind of projects will get you jobs - find something that is within your scope of capabilities; even if this means this is simply a small blogging website or a simple web crawler or even a calculator. Finish that project - and do not use AI tools to complete it.Don’t get me wrong. AI tools are extremely powerful and in the industry we use them daily. But at least where I come from we have a saying, that the AI is only as good as your own understanding - but understanding doesn’t come, unless you put down the groundwork.I’m sorry if this is harsh, but I truly wish you the very best in the future.",

That doesn't mean you need to use AI to do *everything*. Try breaking it down and then only use AI/the internet to figure out specific little details.My first decent sized Java project was an implementation of [SameGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame). It went roughly like this:* Shit* Game board is a 2D array holding red, green, or blue stones. I guess I need a Stone type.* Oh, entries can be Empty* How do I display this?* Wait, I need to display an *image** Google `how to draw gif on screen java`. Yes, I googled this* Google `how to load gif from file java`* Draw a gif that I found somewhere* Draw it 10x across and 5x down* Do I actually need an image or can I just draw circles? No! Circles is loser talk!* Stole animated gifs from another implementation of this program* Created 2D array, filled it with gifs. Displayed them* Break for lunch* Google `how to catch mouse clicks`* Click away happily for a few minutes* Use some advanced math (uh, division and modulo) to convert a point on the screen to an element of the 2D array* Change the code to say \"You clicked square x, y, which contains a blue blob\"* Use my advanced CS degree to do find all the blobs of the same color connected to this blob (flood fill)* etcI can go on for a lot longer, but I hope I've made the point. If I had asked AI to do the whole thing then I would have learned nothing. However, I did most of the work myself and only searched on the intertubes for the *specific* things I didn't know how to do.",

The best way to get out of that loop it is to accept that you will hate it, you will struggle, you will not enjoy the learning process all the time. But you have to accept it because it is part of learning. So, pick whatever technology you have to learn and stick with it. Do a tutorial, code with the tutorial, then try building something without the tutorial, if you get stuck research or go back to the tutorial and repeat. You will learn through projects and through doing, repetition and practice is what will help u not forget. Again, don't be scared of struggle.",

The \"learn → stuck → forget\" cycle is brutal and honestly super common, even for people who've been coding for years.Here's what I think might help break that cycle - you need to pick ONE language and stick with it for the full month. Don't jump between JS, Java, whatever. Pick Python or JavaScript and commit.But here's the key thing - instead of trying to build complete projects from scratch, start by modifying existing code. Find simple programs on GitHub, download them, and just... mess with them. Change variables, add print statements everywhere to see what's happening, break things on purpose. This way you're not hitting that \"how do I make a grid\" wall because the grid already exists.The AI thing is tricky. I actually built Writingmate partly because I saw people struggling with this exact issue. Instead of asking AI \"how do I make a grid\", try asking it to explain existing grid code line by line. Make it your tutor, not your coder.Also - and this might sound weird - try coding the same simple thing multiple times. Like, build a basic calculator 5 times over 5 days. By the 3rd time you'll start remembering the patterns, by the 5th it'll feel natural.One month is actually plenty of time if you focus. Pick Python, find 10 simple projects on GitHub, spend 3 days each just understanding and modifying them. You'll be way more prepared than you think.The forgetting part gets better once you have that foundation, trust me.",

On some platforms like macOS or Android you could write an app that's 99% C with a tiny bit of another language to set things up and write Pong. None of them would be the same.What msot C books or courses will teach you is stuff that's a little more abstract - just problem solving and data manipulation, rather than building a complete app. That reflects how C is used these days. It's the foundational language used behind the scenes of everything so it's really important to know - but it's not the main language used to build apps and the software people actually use.My advice would be to start with Harvard's CS50x.

Express and advanced JS concepts are honestly brutal for beginners, so don't feel bad about struggling with that stuff.For frontend, you're actually in a pretty good spot. Most companies will have designers who create mockups/wireframes for you to implement. You won't usually be designing from scratch unless you're at a tiny startup where everyone wears 10 hats. Your job would be taking those designs and turning them into actual working code.The fact that you've got CSS, HTML and most of JS down is solid. Frontend is way more forgiving when you're learning because you can actually see what you're building instead of staring at terminal outputs all day.At Metana we see students make this exact transition all the time. Backend concepts like databases, server architecture, APIs etc can be overwhelming at first but frontend lets you build confidence with visual feedback. Plus the job market for frontend is pretty decent right now.My advice would be to pick one path and stick with it for now instead of jumping around. If styling feels more natural than wrestling with Express, go frontend. You can always learn backend later once you're comfortable with one side of things. The whole \"full stack\" thing sounds cool but honestly most people end up specializing anyway.Also stop using Mimo and start building actual projects.

Trying to pull trig and algebra patterns out of your head to solve a calculus riddle is math I don't like. But doing reductions of digital logic circuits using math algorithms was fun for me, and I did better some some people good a traditional math. Solving computer science homework/exam problems was hard for everybody, and I had my moments, but you have to picture in your head where you want to go, write it down in pictures, then you can conjure up the code to get there. Well, at least for me. Sometimes my code was called \"brute force\", but I didn't care, it worked and computers are large and fast these days. Sometimes you have to take \"poetic license\" with the requirements of the problem to solve it. I once had a class problem involving recursion. It said each iteration had to spawn the next using the previous values. The entire class literally had the method spin off another thread, until the computer cried out for mercy. I just sent the values of the output back home to the main, made junk collection destroyed the method and recovered the resources, and created a new one, with the saved values. Yeah, sound obvious to you now. :) The rest of the class thought I cheated. The professor gave me a strange look, and said it was OK, probably because I had the only working solution. Just solve the problem. That means first map out how to get from here to there. The coding actually becomes a bit relaxing until you reach compile time, and moment of truth.",

Right now use a file, but what if I wanted to save to a SQL database?Speaking of SQL, expand your project, maybe drop in a simple DB like SQLite and try saving it in that format.Or maybe go learn an UI (Swing or FX) then build a simple little GUI for it beyond just CLI.",

I do not quite understand the issue with having string literals and how an enum will help, I guess I will look into it. I am also confused about how an interface will help with the write operations. How would this help? Does it make the tasks get written to a file instead?I also completely agree with your point on expanding my project by adding a more efficient way to store the tasks like in a SQL database or even building a UI. I am definitely going to look into the SQL database feature but I have been putting off making a UI on Swing or FX because I hear it is not very widely used.",

The error message helps.When it does work, I eyeball the result, to see what it pits out ( usually a hunk of JSON or something ).Next, I write a little test program in my target language to make sure I can hit the API and unpack the result. I start with the example, then refine the example to include my application’s data and credentials and other required information.This helps me cut through all the chaff in the docs. Gets me started. Then reading through the docs is easier, because I have focus.You can pipe JSON through `jq .` to pretty-print it, which helps understand it.",

        "body": "It depends on the scale of the project and the needs of the customer. Though very often there’s multiple phases and kinds of documentation. Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.Further I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.It sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture. However, a Jr. dev will likely be expected to write some unit documentation for the code they create, and may be expected to write user-facing documentation for the feature they implement.",

Like \"how to give someone perms\", \"how to recover from an outage\", type of stuff.

Instead of completely switching, maybe add React or Vue to your JS skills? That way you're building on what you know rather than starting over. PHP backends with modern JS frontends is a killer combo that lots of companies want.The Spring Boot frustration you felt is totally normal.. Java web dev has a steep learning curve compared to Laravel's elegance. Most Java courses do start way too basic which is annoying when you already know how to code.If you really want to explore Java, maybe try building a simple REST API first instead of jumping into Thymeleaf. But honestly? I'd probably spend that 6 months getting really good at Laravel and a modern JS framework. The ROI might be better and you're not starting from scratch.",

Yeah, the DSA question is mostly because it seems like you need them to pass the interviews. I’ve luckily not had any of these in my former jobs. Basically they were more interested in projects and more every day application than DSA. My BIL works in FANG, and said he could get me an interview, but PHP is not allowed to be used to interview. I could probably interview in JS, but then the stack they use is definitely Java, so I’m trying to interview in that. Trying to find the right balance, which was why I jumped into spring boot. I’ve used laravel and really like it, but haven’t done the deep dive. So, in a nutshell, just confused on if I should continue down the path I’m on, or start over. Thanks for your feedback!!",

Good times!It depends what interests you. I started with C++, which was good because it's one of the most popular and well-supported languages there is, but it's relatively hard to get into. That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.Today I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.You can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.Python I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.Definitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",

I recommend you check out https://chessprogramming.org it's one of the best resources for chess programming and has everything you need to know, most of the examples in there are in C, some disagree but i say C is one of the best first languages since you have to actually understand how things work, no import doThing from thingDoer but it takes way longer to actually get something cool you can look at, if you want to go with C raylib provides a great starting point for the more annoying things. The youtube channel \"Sebastian Lague\" has a small series about chess programming that is way more approachable than the wiki (but way less explanatory) that is also a great introduction, his code is in C# using the Unity game engine, unity has a lot of resources and is another great option, Godot is also an option. Python and javascript are the two most common \"starting languages\", i personally don't recommend starting from higher level languages as it's much easier to understand additional abstractions learning from low level languages than to unlearn them moving from high level languages, but there's plenty of resources for both, for python the best option would be probably pygame and js can just run directly in the browser. My recommendation would be to stick with lua that you already know, chess programming is not easy and adding learning a whole new language on top would make it way more difficult.",

Bear in mind that if you do things like wildcard queries, you will end up scanning the entire \"users\" table on every search.If you care about scaling to large numbers of users, then you'll want to use a full-text search engine that can use an index for efficient searching.I'm not familiar with Prisma, but it seems to be a wrapper around Postgres, and Postgres supports full-text search using the `tsvector` and `tsquery` types. This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.If you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr. This adds a lot of complexity because whenever the data in your DB changes, you have to synchronize those changes to your search index.",

A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.Resilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.What you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.Security is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.However, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",

Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the last we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskell etc I tend to use \\`deque\\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions faster than the List (possible premature by me?), then you can hand it back as a list() if you want later.[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)and I have added this: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\\_KEY value.Also, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \\`decouple.config()\\` quite a lot as well.So, that's what we do!",

The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.We had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.One guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?Yeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.Security is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.> I also see job postings that want experience designing \"performant\" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?Software is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",

For example, consider the illustration below—this is of course an extremely artificial example, but the issue it demonstrates is one that I discovered when it caused a production issue at a previous job. For context, like some other languages (I think C++?), PHP allows you to express Boolean operators *either* symbolically (`&&`, `||`, `^`) *or* verbosely (`and`, `or`, `not`). They correspond to the same *logical* operation; that is, both forms are operations on Boolean values, not bitwise operators, so you would naturally expect them to be equivalent. But this is PHP, so they are not. php > $foo=false; var_dump($foo = true || false ? 5 : 10); int(5) php > $foo=false; var_dump($foo = true or false ? 5 : 10); bool(true)Once you see why this happens, you may agree with me that whoever created this mess was *not* much of a language designer. And if that is not enough to convince you, consider all the different levels of overrides and flags around error handling. Or read [this classic](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/).(I’ve rarely touched PHP since I left that job well over a decade ago, so I don’t know how much subsequent development has improved the language. Though the abomination above still behaves just the same now as it did then…)",

        "body": "I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.I'd also disagree that the \"description of an object is called a CLASS\". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.# Classes and ObjectsFirstly, let's define what the word \"object\" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a \"thing\". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's \"old\" or \"blue\") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can \"drive\" or \"honk\"). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that \"thing\"), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. Now, instead of using the words \"adjective\", \"verb\", and \"kind\", let's replace those with more programmy words: - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't \"do\" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a \"key\" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key \"color\" and value \"blue\". - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!). - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as \"templates\" for objects. I want an object that fits the template \"car\" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.Here's an example of a class in JavaScript:```class Car { constructor(color, age){ //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about. this.color = color; this.age = age; } drive() { alert('vroooom!'); }}```And to use this class, I'd do something like this:```const myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');console.log(myCar.color);//'blue'```So why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives \"old\" and \"blue\" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. # WhyClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes: - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior - Can be \"extended\". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might \"extend\" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!The first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: ```const someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');someUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!```# TL;DR:You absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a \"default\".",

        "body": "In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype *** This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012. The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford. You should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak. This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales. A typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already. It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only. You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified. You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new. This is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history. I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title. With prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line. Yep, that's it. We are done.To truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***. In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle. However in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS. When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle. This is the standard method since ECMA6. However there is an older method using the keyword 'new\". With 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle. The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. Why does this matter? This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent. And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child. This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.*** You can use this for all sorts of purposes. It would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination. I do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere. In JS at least you can do it pretty easily. Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely. One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree. But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***Anyway, this is long enough.e: JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme. The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape. However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world. So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future. Obviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions. So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***. It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood. Yes, that's all it is. He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it. This was how he created JS in 3 days. And God took 7 days to create the Universe. Not too shabby.",

Add in your years of service, and you have more going for you than you think! Keep working hard in your courses and start working on some projects that showcase what you're learning, so you will have a portfolio to display your skills when you enter the job market.

For multiplayer, send the text to the server with a Server RPC on the PlayerController, validate length or profanity, then broadcast via the Gamestate or a Multicast so every client updates.To parse commands, check for a leading slash and split the string into a command and arguments, or enable the Regular Expressions plugin if you want pattern matching.Use a RichTextBlock with a DataTable to style names and system messages without custom code.Add simple rate limiting and escape markup so weird input cannot break the UI.If you need references, search for Unreal terms like UMG chat blueprint and replicated chat using PlayerController and GameState, which map directly to this setup hopefully",

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. That is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?**Alternate approach**Many others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following* Pick a project* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it* Learn enough about coding while doing the projectWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.However, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.To me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.When someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing. There are things they think are pretty easy, and it's incredibly difficult.However, you'll see more people posting \"do projects\" than the more academic approach.",

And imo, if you are past the very beginner stage, you should be getting used to researching and solving problems. Thats the main skill you need as a programmer anyway, so what are you truly getting out from a course you pay for? Not a lot to be honest. A degree or a certificate (a valid certificate like the cyber world has) is another thing that may make paying for a course worth it, but you arent getting that from Udemy or CodeAcademy.Seriously, go check out the thousands of playlists on youtube for free.

Using the knowledge you know to build something will teach you more than any course, because you get hands-on experience as to how something works and why it works.So, are paid courses worth it?

        "body": "ARM has a lot of documentation both in PDF and HTML form for AArch64, however modern architectures are completely different beasts compared to the 8086. For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.On macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.General purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)Documentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).Other resources:* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).Note that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5. If you go the Raspberry Pi route I also recommend getting the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, installing OpenOCD, and reading [this thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=362067) on the Raspberry Pi forums for the OpenOCD script.As for setting up the environment for native development on macOS, you don't really need much beyond Xcode's command-line tools, which you can install by typing: xcode-select --installAnd then following the on-screen instructions.---Edit: Added Xcode command-line suggestion.",

But, im not all too familiar with design compared to web dev. If you are trying to design AND build them, learn CSS very well, classic styling tool.As for web dev, you should get yourself familiar with the different components, such as frontend (what users see on the webpage), backend (logic for website components), and database (storing data related to website). Also look into different frameworks, which are just groupings of tools and languages for building. Some popular frameworks include react/node, laravel (php based), and spring boot is gaining attention recently i think. With web dev, you also pay attention to different layers such as optimization, memory consumption, so if you're into optimizing processes, this could be a good path for you too.Personally, I like web dev over web design, although it's nice to know a bit of both. For instance, if you're doing freelance work as a web dev, it's important to know ui/ux design to make your websites look sharp and user-friendly. You should pick which path you want to take based on where you find satisfaction. For me, I absolutely love building something and seeing the hard work I've poured into a project after it's done.Best of luck, and everything will be okay no matter what you choose!",

For instance, processing optimization would be c++, rust, go. Memory allocation/optimization would be c or c#. If you're trying to program AI or ML integration or data analysis, look into python. Python is easiest to learn in my opinion, but it is not as fast as c++.But then again, im not an expert, so I would strongly urge you to do your own research so that you can figure out what you think is best. I personally like C++ most and it was the lang I was taught at the beginning, but it really depends on what you want to do!Also, just a quick tip that with being a good programmer, on top of having a language you know in depth, its crucial that you know how to adapt to new languages quickly. But don't worry, focus on one language for now, and understand the fundamentals of programming like data structures, algorithms, etc., and programming will become a lot easier.Let me know if you want to know anything more :)",

When I first started learning web dev, I started from the very basics with react, and I got some good fundamental knowledge there. I would probably get a book, but only for very fundamental stuff like c++, javascript, or Java, although this is just a recommendation.Also, projects, projects, projects!! Practicing code in any way that is challenging yourself is probably one of the best ways to expand your skillset. Choose a simple project to work on that you have an interest for or would help you out in your own life. Just a fair warning that if you choose to use AI, try not to use it all the time, and use it wisely. I used to use chatgpt, copilot a lot when I first started out, and it's a trap, and it doesn't help you learn despite how fast you get things done. Really nail these concepts in by turning off copilot and learn how to read documentation too.Lastly, don't be afraid to fail. Failure is one of the best ways to learn. Don't be too concerned with what are the best practices for something at the very beginning. Programming is all about problem solving, so try to solve the problem yourself first, and then look into better practices afterwards. This way, you don't get overwhelmed by the varying different solutions to different problems.",

We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.It was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.After about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.After a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.After that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.That was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a \"solutions\" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.Two more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).A few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.If you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up. You can always teach yourself (as I did) but sometimes learning in a formal, structured setting has its benefits.",

You can go for careers that rely heavily on some kind of exam like law and finance.My gf for example worked as a teller at one bank then moved to the investment department at another. Now she is working as an assistant at a small law firm while trying to get her law clerk diploma. Her experience in the other jobs do help and that is a big factor in any market.I didn't have any internship experience and worked for shares at a small startup after graduation. Took me 1500 applications to land a decent job and even that was super lucky. Has a lot of projects which helped a lot along with retail experience and that software dev startup job. How you present yourself matters. Even retail sales associate experience helped me land a job since I tied it to personal development.Try in your field first, it's a numbers game, then look for stuff like law clerk, sales and all. Get some experience, any experience, but tie it well. Coding was not bad in school and uni but trust me the requirements and competition is crazy for jobs. Need to know so many different stacks and stuff keeps changing from job to job.",

Python only lead to me floundering for a while with not much feedback on how to get better.Its funny too when you talk about Haskell because in all cases it should be an obvious choice but you'll get people who have only done python for 10 years saying crazy myths. The point of software is to build something that works for a business or market problem, all these other languages sacrifice that correctness for being \"easy to learn\" while not admitting that most who learned that language stay stuck as a junior for a long time. So if you want to learn fast, you need fast feedback on what you are doing wrong, and so you want a language like Haskell thats gonna give you that fast feedback. Funny thing is, that once you get past these beginner exercises that you'll do in any language, its easy to move on to advanced haskell where you have 100s of features that dont exist at all in other languages",

And you can have lots of non-ASCII characters that are perfectly readable.It sounds like what you're looking for is a way to simplify a website to get it just the readable bits? If so then this is a great little project. Let me set some expectations for you though.There are different degrees of solving this because all websites are constructed differently. For simple websites this will be a good challenge for an introductory developer like yourself. As websites get more and more complex, and have multiple components and internal frames that get loaded, or use dynamic loading, this becomes more and more of a challenge. You could come back and revisit this problem for years to come as your skills grow. Some websites are almost designed to make what you are doing here next to impossible. So bottom line don't be surprised if what you build doesn't work for all sites at first, but it still will be a good exercise for your time, and possibly will make for an actual useful tool regardless. I'd recommend targeting Wikipedia at first as I believe its pages are constructed fairly simply.For a much more complex example, try extracting your receipts from Kroger or Costco. In both cases the nice viewable page you're presented with is constructed in your browser, in Kroger's case from multiple sources, and would be very hard to read the text of directly. But that can wait until much later.",

How do you know a candidate isn't just remembering what they've studied and going by memory? You can't know that's not what's happening, so now, candidates not only have the pressure of studying hundreds of problems and remembering how to apply them but they also have the pressure of trying to appear like they're the first person ever to come up with this solution in 30 minutes even though these solutions took academics years or decades to develop. Anyway, in other areas of life, I've had people suspect things about me that weren't true, but they just \"knew\" they were right and were completely wrong. If a candidate's not using AI is so important that the mere suspicion of their using without the actual confirmation of it is enough to get the candidate essentially black-listed, then companies should only test candidates in environments in which using AI is not an option.",

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.An area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I’d argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that’s as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar. And all of the software that runs this, as well as the apps people use to engage with it, require software devs.So they’re either doing that, or trying to pump out another meme coin. It’s a pretty harsh dichotomy imo.",

Decentralization is a complex problem to solve, and its difficult to figure out consensus with seemingly decentralized nodes in a network.Its why I got into block chain, because its just a cool computer science problem. I think the crypto hype is what has really killed it. And so it has made blockchain as a technology feel less legitimate. But its still fairly legit as a problem to solve. The issue is that its may not be solveable, or you can only have solutions with trade offs.I really see the same problem with AI adoptions. It also has some fundamental problems.

Sometimes it's by \"motivator/influencer\" who gives away list of email address to whoever attended their \"motivation\" program. Most of these are likely from 3rd countries(including my country, not dissing anyone) and since people are desperate, they are doing it. Meanwhile, their names are added to blacklist of companies, in contrast to the \"successful stories\" of those talkers. There were 3 or 4 people who get job by doing it, out of thousands, and these fuckers are misleading people to apply job in that way. 2. Targeted operation. Either rampant scam call centers, not properly prosecuted(or sometime outright negligent) from India or China(and remaining Southeast Asia bases. Fuck you CCP, cleanup your house properly) or just like in recent news of North Korean taking jobs in USA companies.",

I'll hit em back with a \"Aight, I'm tied up right now. Get started on debugging, I'll sync up with you later\". This then very explicitly creates the expectation that they need to take a stab at it before we sync up.I find more often than not, if I invent a little bit of space, people manage to figure out their issues by themselves, or at least get further along and try various things.Instant gratification, and spoonfeeding people answers, is what cultivates this kind of culture where at the first sign of any sort of issue you immediately go to Person X. And when you've cultivated a culture like that.... why wouldn't they? Why in the world would I read through logs, find the error, google that error, and spend time figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it? There's no need for me to do that if I can send a message to Person X and get an answer dropped in my lap.Not everyone is coachable that way, and that way isn't an instant-fix either. It takes a lot of time. Way more time than if I just kept doing it myself and sending them answers. But I have significantly improved my work life when I've landed on teams with people like this by slowly but surely coaching them to do things on their own without just abruptly telling them to pound sand.It makes a great story for interviews when asked about mentorship as well.",

Its impossible to estimate \"potential and problem-solving ability\" from a single interview. Companies were not hiring for specific tech stacks before because the demand outweighed the supply. Hiring juniors is always a bet and now companies have the luxury of choosing among a vast pool of them. Of course they will rather choose the guy who aligns somewhat with their tech stack rather than the guy whose only coding experience is C++ console programs. Risk is still there but at least the first guy wont need 2-3 months to start being productive.",

Go onto LinkedIn, filter by recently added, apply to pretty much anything relevant with under 100 applicants. The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. 2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. 3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. \"Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%\"). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.4. If a job requires a cover letter, it usually has less candidates. It sucks, but it's usually worth it. Don't use AI, just write about how your skills that are relevant to the position helped you deliver results.",

You might be given vague specifications (\"do thing that make profit!\") alongside very precise and bullshit instructions as to how you should implement something (\"using latest AI models!\"). You might have a coworker or boss whose approval you rely upon who is toxic. There are countless examples where your autonomy is stripped and you are put in an impossible position and you are pointedly told to deal and STFU.Burnout isn't limited to just tech, but I think it's more common in tech than most professions to have a few decisions made above you to render pointless the entirety of your work output while the expectations to \"perform\" remain.",

The very real risk of layoffs without warning.4. Being constantly individually measured and tracked in an overwhelming number of ways (most of which are divorced from actual productivity).5. As a developer, spending less than 10% of my time actually developing (and instead wearing mostly Ops and BA hats because the employer doesn't want to actually have Ops engineers or BAs).6. The bureaucracy - Agile in name only, sprawling meetings, seemingly random change moratoriums, sudden drastic changes in policies, etc.7. No control over fixing any of it.How am I breaking out?

I wouldn't even target tech -> focuse on retail, medical, defense, gov, etc every business needs swe after 50-100 apps batches you should have some feed back loop to itterate off where your hit rate is, each batch applications itterate until your hit rate is high enough get few interviews, and then follow similiar process once you get to interview stage if your not passing them.I see biggest thing is at eod lot of bottem barrel people are not doing enough volume, lack of itterating, and when you actually get to interview stage your problem going fail dozen or so and need to itterate/learn from pitfalls for your next interview.",

Reason being, your differentiating skills are going to be in things that are not as easily duplicated. An underrated feature of AI is the way that it's sort of locking in the current prevalent tech stacks, warts and all. But that also has the impact of putting a hard cap on what we can express well in these paradigms. My view is that differentiation will come through mastery of different topics, like logic programming, machine learning, etc. and knowing when/how to apply these intelligently. In the future, it doesn't matter much if you're a React developer or not. That's not where you'll find your value.",

You will be fine with being a jack of all trades. But keep in mind the market sucks, so don’t consider that a reason if you can’t get a job. Also, 33 isn’t that old - not old enough for fears of being left behind. I’m 2 years your senior and also had a less than normal background. I have a lot more depth in front end and react, but I can still muddle my way through other things. And my focused areas for depth of knowledge has changed as the industry does (nobody needs the depth of knowledge I do about CSS or mixins anymore lol), but that’s fine. Understanding data pipelines etc is something I believe is very valuable if that is what you’re interested in, and I’m always grateful to have other devs on the team with some understanding of what I do (React) because it means we can articulate needs ro one another easier (which is why breadth is so important)",

Your experience in other tech is cool, but not directly applicable to the needs.Conversely, if a job needs someone who can solve some microservices problems in Golang, TypeScript, C#, and Java, with occasional database management work in MySQL and MongoDB from their early startup days, then a jack of all trades is going to be nifty. Especially now that someone wants to add Python and R to the mix for data stuff, and you're experienced in picking up new things to get the ball rolling until an expert is needed.The real problem is proving you have any skills worth looking at in the first place.

Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.Instead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills.

I was able to learn a lot, but one harsh reality I've realized is that there is a lot of stuff that I did that doesn't fit in with current industry standards and best practices. I've only gotten about 5 interviews over the last few months, and I've been struggling with the technical interviews as well. It's been eye-opening for me to see my shortcomings. I've also questioned whether I'm still good enough to remain in this industry. For now, all I've been doing has been trying to better myself for what my role actually requires. I've been doing courses, studying up on terminology, and I've even been studying my resume to make sure I can fully explain anything I did that's on it.Every rejection is demoralizing, but for the interviews that I do get, I take it as a learning experience since it highlights another thing I need to work on.",

The broadness of the prep really messed with me too.I think I still would of been boned if I had to start over but know what I learned from this layoff.I know what you mean, I thought I was out of the industry too. Out of the 23 attempts I only got 2 offers, and one was laughably bad compared to what I used to have. For me specifically, even though every company was vastly different - I eventually kind of caught on there is overlap to an extent. Try to identify that, and leave the rest up to chance.The reality is you have to get 90-100% on the \"exams\" and your competition has to screw up at our YOE ( tie breakers will usually go to most YOE or whoever stood out more). I had more than one job give me feedback that I actually did really good during the interviews, but my competition would have triple my experience and have a similar performance. I lost twice for a 6 round top 2 finalist.. right before I started my job I nailed round 3/4 for a 130k remote job then ghosted. It's just unfair lol. The job I got my final competition was 20 yoe, 8 yoe, 15 yoe. I won at 3 yoe because I was the only one who solved the coding challenge, answered every question correct, AND they liked me / personality fit went well. It took 23 times to set up that scenario. That day was crazy. I had FIVE onsites in a week for 4 companies. I had TWO onsites the day I finally won one stupid job. Funny part is it was the one I thought I did bad on because their API challenge was absolutely stupid. They were like YOU HAVE 7 MINUTES TO MAKE A GET REQUEST API ON THIS CODEBASE HERES A LAPTOP.I was like ??. I survived being nearly interrogated by 3 men answering every question and had to completely switch gears. I've failed so many interviews due to stress and pressure. This particular time I think I was jaded that I had so many onsites in a week and had to go drive to my 2nd one literally right after this I took a breath and started. I talked out loud my thoughts, reiterating the REST pattern of controller implementation repostiory layers. I copied a different GET request in that file and started asking questions about the method and made the params or wrote comments what I wanted to do. I updated the same in the interface/model. I went into the repository layer and just copied how they're connecting to the DB and started making it. I ran out of time and couldn't make it run. Left going screw this place.Turns out I did the best and got further than the others... But the catch was it's a government job so it took 3 MONTHS to get a start date due to a lot of background checks.For me personally, I wasn't getting leetcode that often towards the end. I did lose at least 3 positions because of failing the leetcode, but most of them didn't have it. I lost 2 positions to system design. What I did get almost consistently was this \"tech trivia\" interviews in my market. Asking very specific concepts or language questions and building off off it. I used free tier LLM's to give me 20-30 questions and go in depth prompting and trying to understand all the concepts. I would use the mic feature to simulate interview questions 1 by 1 and get feedback. I found that greatly helped me pass that round even if it wasn't perfect.Turns out some companies were getting questions from the same bank as me, and I would occasionally get some verbatim things I studied. Like what is async and go into detail. What is a Singleton. How would you debug an expensive SQL query. I also found by simulating those questions I had a higher chance of coming up with at least a passable sounding answer.I still suck at it - but to work on the little debugging / API / leetcode easiest / fill in the methods.. I went and did leetcode easy problems and put a timer for 10 minutes. My goal was to talk out loud and explain everything, and make a solution, test, run. In those simulations I could still feel pressure even then. Being at 8-9 minutes and I missed an edgecase and scrambling to fix it. I think that was the right path to work on the pressure part. If you're struggling specifically with crud api's I'd use LLM's to help you make a simple crud in your stack and study it. You could time urself to make a stupid crud or analyze a piece of code it generated / something open source ( I didn't end up doing this)So in return, I basically was like my odds of passing are lower if I get Leetcode med or hard, system design, or something I haven't seen before. It's just too vast. You do want to work on it all but if I were to go again, id try to perfect a \"section\" of the interview during downtime, and cram like hell for whatever the current interview is gonna be.It still sucks, I don't know the answer. I still can't believe I went thru all that. My actual job a month in isn't easy but it's kinda laughable how much lower expectations are vs the interview I had there. I'm getting a month to build a GET request, make test cases, consume it on the front end. Not 7 minutes... LolI think if I had 6 more months to study I'd be closer to a top candidate but realistically I just need more resume experience for right now.",

Realizing that I could get a CS degree and never have to work minimum wage retail jobs again, though this was almost a decade ago so the market was much brighter for new grads.Your CS degree can still be a wonderful entry into a tech job that isn’t programming, but you need to figure out what that is. The easiest way to do that is probably getting a programming job, observing the various roles around it, and making a switch.RE your self doubt, you’re smart enough to get a degree in CS, you seem motivated to get some credentials, to me it seems like you have a strong skill set. You made a game and open sourced it, that takes skill.If you make a plan and present that to your parents, they will see it’s not your lack of initiative, it’s the fact that the rug (tech job market) has been pulled out so quickly from beneath you and there’s little to no support systems in place.Also +1 to stop searching for remote gigs. Execs want new grads in office, your search will be much harder if you are trying to avoid this. Additionally, the first couple years in office were so beneficial to my skills and career.",

They also pay for lots of certifications like SANS (extremely technical and hands on) and most US companies look favorably on veterans.

So, if your employer uses a proprietary language or framework they can reject \"other candidates\" because they don't meet said requirements. The corollary also applies. A college friend took nearly ten years to get LCA (labor certification the old process) because he had about the most generic Unix and Ingres job possible, and a moron lawyer who wouldn't know an LCA if it apparated in his office...The system is screwed as long as loopholes like these remain open.",

If after asking this question, they keep coming and asking the same questions.Some people feel stupidly superior to people who just start while they have a lot of experience with it. Why do they not compare themselves to developers with similar amount of experience? From what I see it is often that people who compare themselves with people who barely started are not that great to begin with. Compering with people who have similar amount of experience does not make them feel better.Or they are just insecure as they know they are not that great and comparing to people who have less experience than them is the only way to feel better about themselves.",

In those roles, you'll learn how to build and operate scalable software that interacts with a large number of other teams. Start-ups will allow you to wear lots of different kinds of hats, solving more open-ended problems.

Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.I think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4. I am very confident this process filters out 100% of the people who can't do the job. They verify all the skills needed to do the daily work that people apply every day. Perfect, imho. I don't get why it is so difficult for other companies to do the same.This process is applied by a tech unicorn, so it definitely works at scale too..",

Big companies have UX teams that come up with different user experiences and test them with users. They also watch how people use existing interfaces, for example, to see where they are stuck or confused. Then they run A/B tests to see if there are improvements. For smaller companies, UX oftentimes falls on frontend developers and/or product owners. Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution. Then hand that off to engineering to actually build it. Engineering then demos it to UX and product to verify it’s what is expected.",

About the only site I can think of that adheres to most of his principles still is jacobin.com (I’m not here preaching their politics fyi).  There’s also the issue that the people who’d build systems have a world view very different from the average user and can often assume people should just become experts. You may want to look at the writings of Alan Cooper, specifically “The Inmates are Running the Asylum”",

I see so many posts on here about people struggling and they’re ONLY looking for remote jobs or jobs in their small/medium metro area where no large companies reside. Of course that’s going to be difficult. I had friends who held out for remote roles as their first CS job experience and many of them were unemployed for double or triple the time of those who were willing to move to a new city. For context, I moved from LA/OC metro area to Austin TX. There were simply more software jobs here, and especially more openings for new grads compared to anywhere in LA.",

The people hiring you are also putting in a lot of hours for every person they interview. At a minimum 2-3hrs x 4+ employees spent on you alone. That's a minimum for like a small company, it only goes up from there. You are expensive and they don't owe you anything. The exchange _should_ be mutual, that's only fair.As someone who avoids giving people take-homes. We end up with a lot of obvious bad fit interviews and wasted time as a consequence. It would save us tens of thousands of dollars if we just had some sort of short basic skillset pre-screening. I can see why companies pick that option.",

The head of HR was biased against unemployed people, even though she herself had been laid off before. Another engineer felt they could lowball a specific candidate. Unless you’re an absolute rockstar, you don’t have much leverage without a current job or competing offers. I got laid off recently. I was making a very good base comp. Enough that I had a small case of golden handcuffs. When speaking to a recruiter, I decided to give a number a little lower than I had been making. The market is rough, and I didn’t want to price myself out. I got an offer. If I hadn’t been laid off, I could have asked for more money. i usually try to avoid saying my number first, but I didn’t in this case. I may have cost myself money by doing that. When I told them my number, they said it was very doable. So, they likely had more budget. I explained my situation to them. I ended up getting more than I originally asked for, as we had some more decisions around comp, but not what I was making previously. I’m OK with it for now. I'm of the mindset jobs are temporary, but I’d love to find a long-term place. Of course I wish I was making the same or more. FWIW, I was honest during my interview process. Most people seemed reasonable, and they did offer more than my original stated number. But who knows what they said on their own? And they didn’t give a lot more than I asked for.",

I know the standard answer is always therapy, but I do think you'd benefit from discussing this with a therapist because odds are this is the type of stuff where you kinda need to do some work. Like, you need a plan, you need someone to hold you accountable, etc. My wife also has OCD, and that has always been an issue for her - it's that feeling that if she doesn't do it, and then it doesn't get done right, that it's all her fault and the worst possible scenario will materialize. Like, she did a masters and had no less than 10 breakdowns where she thought she was going to fail a test and get kicked out of the program... she got straight As bro. For 2 straight years. So yeah, I know a lot of people here are jumping straight to \"IT'S THE COMPANY CULTURE\". It doesn't sound like it is, it sounds like it's literally just you not letting yourself believe that you can take the time off without everything falling apart.There are things you can do to help - like, you can put together a plan for when you're out, you can talk to your boss and tell them you have this irrational concern so that she can let you know that's not the case and you can totally go.But it might be trickier than that.",

In that moment, all we will have are our memories, which will either be of fulfillment or regret, no money, none of ypur coworkers or bosses to comfort you, none of your worldy possessions. If working genuinely makes you happy, and if that is how you wish to spend your life, then good. However, if this thought gives you anxiety, maybe you should rethink not taking PTO.",

Burnout is a VERY real thing, and it's a lot harder to come back from being burnt out than it is to take the time off so you won't hit that point to begin with. Constantly working without taking time for yourself or some self-care will eventually affect your focus, your motivation, and your ability to do your job as best you can.It sounds like your coworkers / managers /etc aren't pressuring you to not use it, which is great. If you genuinely feel like no one can do your job while you're away, that's a huge weakness for your team - no single dev should be load-bearing on a project. It also isn't great for your ability to be promoted if you're seen as the only person who can do your particular job. This would be a GREAT thing to talk to your supervisor about in your next one-on-one. \"I've found that I feel guilty taking PTO because I worry that things will break down while I'm gone. What can we do to make our team more flexible, so that our ability to function well doesn't depend on me specifically sitting in that chair?\" Maybe have some suggestions - more comprehensive documentation, perhaps some cross-training with others on your team so have more of a grasp of each other's particular roles? This could even be a great look for you if you can lead the charge in getting your team to a point where you're relying on process and not personnel.",

Employers have so much to choose from, they'll easily find someone who has experience with the stack they use and will be productive on day 1.Given that you are a recent grad, you have no previous job but you have your coursework, your projects, your interests. Try to find jobs that align with those.If you are going to keep contributing to OSS or building projects of your own, try to stick to a theme or domain. Using a particular language, or a specific stack. Or writing code that is used by a specific industry. Basically look at the kind of jobs you want to target and try to develop the skills they want and need.I am sorry you graduated in the middle of a downturn. This is literally night and day compared to most of the recent 25 years if you forget the dot com bust and the massive 2009 real estate crash.

This is my third one since I graduated and the odds are good I will get to enjoy a fourth before I leave this plane of existence.",

        "body": "Couple things on the resume. 1. You have far too much diverse experience. Add a career summary at the top of the resume that rounds out all of your experience and the skills that you picked up. I would then consolidate the skills section to just the important skills that are referenced in a job listing. 2. Leave out the career gap. They can infer that from gaps between one job to another. 3. I don't think the awards section is relevant personally. If you want to keep it for sentimental reasons then I'd suggest having it last. 4. You have far too much job experience to still warrant having projects in my opinion. I'd remove them. 5. Add more information on the jobs that you had. Simply listing the jobs is not enough. Explicitly mention the technologies and tools used and what projects you did. 6. Languages is not necessary in my opinion. Most applications ask for this before you input your resume. But it could be different for you, If so, then it can be kept. But I'd make it a single line.As for the job application, I prefer Indeed to LinkedIn personally and got my last job through there. Also I'd suggest applying on the company website whenever possible, companies have separate pipelines for applications and pay attention to the ones that come in through their website. I'd also say that don't just fire off the same resume hundreds of times. Tweak it slightly for every single job and ensure that it meets all of the minimum and most of the preferred qualifications. Also, I somewhat disagree with what another user on here said, the goal of your resume nowadays is to pass the ATS, not talk to a live person. Your resume should obviously be in human readable format but it should be jam packed with enough key words from the job description to get a high enough match and pass the ATS. After passing the ATS, you just have to convince a real human to hire you... which is far easier than some automated check that fails damn near everyone.",

A school like WGU or other online schools are under 5k a semester, which is pretty easy to swing if you don't have other obligations. Get in the habit of keeping your expenses low now while you have your first big job, and it'll make life a lot easier.If you intend to get it, try to get your degree before getting married and having a kid. :face_with_tears_of_joy: It gets a lot harder otherwise.If you want to chat and have another self taught contact, feel free to DM me.",

        "body": "I'll stick to answering your questions. PIPs are not a legal requirement. But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.By placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.As for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.Each one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.I can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.I'm sorry you are going through this. Hopefully you find yourself in a better job soon.ETA spelling out for the inexperienced that the boss from the job wouldn't be one to use as a reference if you waited out the PIP and got fired.",

We are used to direct critical feedback, even to people older/above us, they really aren’t. Anyways, don’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable. You can always communicate your boundaries and if they aren’t respected, you have your answer. You can always steer conversations back to professional, proactively would be something like “hey I want to learn more let’s stick to xyz”, or be very direct and say “hey i’m a little uncomfortable getting so personal can we stick to professional conversations just in discord?”In the future, don’t let relationships get more personal if you don’t want them to.

Hospitality for CERTAIN individuals especially towards foreigners can be overly kind and exagerated like this. Almost too gracious. My Uncle is an ESL teacher now experiences the same exact thing (he's white though) and families from both Korea and Japan invite him over and treat him, invite over to eat with their family etc. They pay for everything, give him expensive gifts, etc. I have experienced this as well in Korea living there for 5 years. The compliments were crazy like, Ah you're angel, you're so smart, you're so handsome, etc etc. It was a LOT from different people and honestly I felt like a celebrity there.Japan has a heiarchy of age and mentorship. Japanese call this like a Senpai-Kouhai relationship. Basically they view their job as an older person or mentor to guide you, treat you, and sort of mold you as best they can. It can be weird from a westerner perspective because work time is work time and there's no \"relationship\" besides training you. I personally wouldn't be alarmed by this behavior but I'd still maintain distance. A lot of these type of people are fascinated with having foreign friends. it's largely a selfish relationship for them. I often felt like a token foreigner friend and many girls wanted to date me just for being a foreigner. I sense this guy is the same. The other part of this is that a lot of these people use you as a way to feel some sort of acceptance outside their own culture. Like, oh I have a foreign friend that accepts me, I'm cool out of my own normal societal circumstance. Just be polite and keep saying I can't do X or Y. Japanese sometime will take the initial no as polite no. So you need to say no like 7 or 8 times until it goes through. Be persisent but gracious and you won't have any issues.",

If they explode and start ranting at you incoherently while you remain calm, collected and \\*extra\\* polite it will often go very badly for them afterwards.You have to be careful if they act like dr jekyll and mr jackass, because if he's an ass kisser to management while he shits you on you, management may well think that you're the problem.

Once everyone starts talking about a hot new job category it gets flooded with applicants and the entry-level folks end up holding the bag. You actually need enough skin in the game by that time to be able to move into more advanced roles. Because what is going to happen with trades is the same thing that happened to tech since 2022. When I graduated from high school in 2007 that hot profession to get into was Pharmacy, 3 years before that it was Biotech, etc. our education system is really bad a distributing folks into roles that need filling.",

If this is for senior+ level roles, then not having had many technically challenging projects with wider scope and ambiguous requirements that you need to drive discovery in addition to implementation for is legitimately something that will (and in all fairness should) work against you, because those are exactly the types of projects senior engineers are hired to work on, and companies want to see proof that you can successfully do that type of work.If you're interviewing more for entry to mid level roles, then I think you can make this type of project feel more impressive and impactful by talking about the business need that drove the work, any technical design decisions you made (however small - like researching and deciding to use some third party library), any collaborations you were involved in for the project (both engineering and cross functionally), how you tested and deployed your feature, and what the business impact was.For instance, maybe the technical piece you worked on was just calling some API endpoints to fetch data and building a dashboard in React - pretty straightforward project. In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard. Even if these things feel like standard process and not that interesting to you, talking about them shows that you understand what goes into the things you build at a higher level beyond just the code you are asked to write.",

He can do his work autonomously, but he doesn’t actually think about the business and what we can do to improve, he is technically strong. He takes something from the roadmap and kind of drives the execution, but he puts no effort into understanding why we are trying to do something or how something can be improved. He has to ask us for basic business context, which shows he is only focussed on a solution, he doesn’t actually care about the teams goals.

I've found oftentimes startups want to interview people who are ok with \"doing everything\" and are ok with absolutely 0 structure.

Bad - family reasons. Really bad - pay, growth, “opportunities”. Remember the hiring manager wants you working for him as long as possible. The only 100% acceptable time to willingly quit is when it does not impact him anymore (ex. reorganization).",

The best fix is practice: mock interviews, talking through your design process out loud, even recording yourself so it feels natural. For UI/UX, employers care less about perfect answers and more about how you think.Also, keep networking or visit co-working spaces in your area because many design jobs get filled before they’re posted. You already have the degree, portfolio, and CS background; now it’s about showing your thought process and getting more comfortable under interview pressure.",

Instead of focusing on every technical detail, think of the story. What problem you were solving, why you chose certain design or tech decisions, and what the outcome was. Hiring managers often care more about how you think than whether you explain every technical term perfectly. Mock interviews, even with a friend or through platforms like Pramp, can also help you get more comfortable.Blanking out happens when your brain is overloaded. Try breaking things into simple, clear steps in your answers, and don’t be afraid to pause for a second to collect your thoughts. Interviewers usually don’t mind a short pause if it leads to a clearer answer. Over time, with practice, that blanking moment will happen less and less. Also, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of tips like this. Breaking into tech, career advice, and handling interviews. You might find it helpful for staying motivated and sharpening your approach.",

Whatever feels empty inside will resolve itself if you just stop the chase. You already have everything you need you're just so blindsided by the thrill of doing that you can't see any of it. So just stop, not forever, just for a while. Take at least 6 months off, take it easy, eat better food, sleep for a while, do other things, answers will surface when the storm is cleared.

But from my experience, CS at UBC is pretty solid, and the program is renowned in Canada.I personally did a data science minor in addition to my CS degree, but you can also minor in statistics or math if you prefer to get some theory under your belt.TLDR: UBC isn't known for its ML curriculum, but the CS program is top-notch.",

If the work is satisfying to you and tickles your brain don't switch career paths to do something you don't enjoy, there's value in doing something you like. It's also difficult to find a career with this type of opportunity (even if you might struggle to find a job initially), you can work for a FAANG or F500 company without necessarily having to know the right people or live in the right place. Regarding your concern about actually finding a job, here's what I'll say:**You'll find a job**. If you're passionate and put in the work, you'll find a job.**Don't rely solely on your degree(s)**. Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. **Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn. If you're passionate about CS all of this won't feel like work and it will get you a job.",

        "body": "Context: Currently a mid level SDE working in big tech inCanada, have been for my entire career (6 years).First, idk if UBC is definitively 2nd in Canada lol but its definitely one of the universities competing for 2nd with McGill and UofT. I can't speak much for ML, but I work in a team with over 50% of the engineers being MLEs. Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. There are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. Downside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. That being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29. All this is to say that its going to be hard to break in, but its definitely still a good way of life. If you got any more questions I can answer for you just go ahead and shoot!",

I could go into the issues with advice subreddits in particular.... but I don't need to to make my point. Dont make major life decisions off anecdotes you read on *any* subreddits, doesn't matter which one.If you want to pursue CS, pursue CS.There are *plenty* of new grads that are lining up jobs just fine. You know where they are? Not on a CS Careers Questions subreddit. They're not here talking about how easy their job search was. They're enjoying their life.The unemployment rate for new CS grads is 6.1%. While that number is high, and puts us in the top 10 for highest unemployment rates by degree.... That still means 93.9% of CS new grads are employed.The underemployment rate for new CS grads is 16.5%. This is the number of people employed in a job that utilizes their college degree. So it filters out the people that gave up and went to McDonalds. *This* number for us puts us in the *bottom 5* for all degrees regarding underemployment. We're doing pretty damn well. Or I should say 83.5% of us are doing pretty damn well.The 6.1%? The 16.5%? Those are the people that make up the majority of an advice subreddit's demographic, *because they need advice.* The 93.9% and 83.5% aren't normally posting here. And when they do (hello, it's me), they often get downvoted because it hurts to hear that you're in the bottom 16.5% of the industry. I understand it hurts to hear that, that percentage translates into a lot of people, but it's something people need to hear.And people not in the industry at all, like you, shouldn't be blinded by those peoples experiences.",

And apply to roles where there is a coding round so those skills can shine through>I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber insteadYes, that's called opportunity cost. It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.The way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviewsI don't think you're being a negativity spreader.

You already have 2 years at big tech, that's actually gold for ML roles if you spin it right.Instead of going straight to a traditional masters, why not look into something more targeted? At Metana we've seen people make this exact transition without dropping 50k on a degree. The trick is building a portfolio that shows you can actually do the work, not just pass exams.Your research internship is clutch, lean into that hard. Start contributing to open source ML projects, build some models that solve real problems, document everything on github. Companies care way more about seeing you ship ML products than seeing another piece of paper.Also lol at \"computational biology being a one off\", that lab probably just follows the funding, which is how academia works. Don't take it personally.If you're dead set on the masters route, consider part time programs or even bootcamp-style intensive programs that focus specifically on ML/data science. Way cheaper, way more practical, and you keep earning while learning.But honestly? With your big tech experience, I'd bet you could transition internally at a different company before needing any additional schooling. The key is positioning your SWE skills as \"I understand production systems AND ML theory\" rather than \"I'm just another SWE who wants to do ML.\"The market sucks right now but ML roles are still out there, especially if you can show you understand both sides of the equation.",

They usually do these round more than once, sometimes in person (on last steps, when they are almost ready to give you the offer). Its relatively simple to prepare for it, you either grind leetcode (solve \\~100 mid problems, and you will be in a good shape), or use tools like [https://techscreen.app/](https://techscreen.app/) or interviewcoder \\- system/tech designs. For you most likely will be 1 round (and 2 for senior positions). If you've built any personal projects - you should be all set with this one, since they dont ask for that much. Examples from my experience - design autocomplete or url shortener. \\- Final round, on this one the company runs 1 more round of something they are not sure about you. Like algorithms, or system design, so, just be prepared for more than 1 round of any type of interview.You got this! Good luck",

Was it to see how well I would design a system or was it on whether I read a book?To see if you can regurgitate what you memorized on Youtube. And be a good talker. Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.This is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.\"We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.\"So ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.In the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways. And even at those big tech firms sql databases are used in many teams.As for what kind of databases I worked over so far: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, cassandraAlmost all companies using MongoDB are using MongoDB for no reason than \"it's webscale\" meme. It's tech debt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)Use case for Cassandra/DynamoDb is niche overall.Scale? Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\\^5 \\* 10\\^5 sec a day = 10\\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.Schemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.ACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.Biggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.Sharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up? Ya, nonissue.It's all a clownfest at this point with each databases trying to emulate parts of the other database as well.**System Design Interview crap made more sense back when hardware was limited. Nowadays, we can have Redis instance with over half a terrabyte RAM. Many times, we can just chug the entire useful parts of database to the whole Redis.** Now caching? Lol wait till you learn DynamoDB handles that for you if you are willing to pay extra. DynamoDB comes with caching by a click of a button so you don't need to handle a separate Redis instance. Just pay more money to AWS. All these \"scale problems\" you see in system design interviews are basically being all solved by Cloud providers. Cloud providers are not stupid. AWS needs to make more money. Why not just add more features to address all the known system design workarounds of the past?",

System Design interview prep alone can take months. Similar idea with Leetcode and so forth. And realistically years because you do this in sprints over your career as you level up.Basically say your job only involves taking sums (adding basic items). If you test the candidate all sorts of ideas like taking sum/division/multiplication/difference of real numbers (negative numbers, decimals, integers, irrational numbers, etc), imaginary numbers, symbols, etc. then you can feel somewhat assured the person can probably add basic numbers reliably. Is that correlation perfect? Nope. But I would find it hard pressed to find someone who can do a complex operation involving multiple paranthesis, imaginary number, negative number, multiplication, addition all nested together to struggle with basic additions consistently. It also helps you filter as much candidates as you want and make you feel \"I got the best candidate out of thousands\".",

I have 4-5 years of experience but all in service based companies. I am struggling extremely to switch to the top product based companies to the point that I don't even land interviews. I am thinking of taking a break for about a few months and acquiring new skills during the break including any certification which might allow me to at least land the interviews in product based companies.

        "body": "First thing I’d suggest is to pause the scattershot learning for a moment. It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.If you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.If you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog. And if you’d like more step by step advice, practical roadmaps, and career tips, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of that. It might help you stay focused and feel less alone while you rebuild.",

What matters isn’t whether they’re serious enterprise apps, but whether they show that you can solve problems, write clean code, and explain your thought process. Uploading them to GitHub is a solid move, especially if you add good README files that explain what the project is, why you built it, and what technologies you used. Think of it as showing employers how you think, not just what you’ve built. You could even take it a step further and combine the two worlds try hosting your game backend on AWS, or containerize it with Docker. That way, you’re not only showing coding skills but also practical cloud skills. It doesn’t have to be fancy, just demonstrating that you know how to deploy and manage something live in the cloud will help bridge that experience gap employers care about so much.",
