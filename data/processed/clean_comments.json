Data scientists usually need to spend more time conceptualizing the model and figure out what the problem is, what the model should do, how to engineer the data to accurately represent the business scenario, what are the biases in it, what are the limitations of the model, etc. These challenges take enough of their time and mental capacity that considering anything more will actually lead to compromising the model quality. They also tend(based on my own bias) to be non-coders, like statisticians, phds, analytics etc., and the technical aspects like package compatibility, resource limitations, pipeline and deployment don't really come to their mind. It's not that they are not bothered, it's just that they are not aware of the challenges engineers deploying the project face.I understand the challenges engineers face and it can be so frustrating. Awareness and communication between the two teams is important. Make them aware of the issues you face. Help them understand the importance of following coding standards. There are so many tools nowadays which can help with all these challenges, if the data scientists are aware of it, they will definitely use it to make your experience better and make the overall process faster and smoother.",

One guy made it his annual goal last year to \"increase AI use in our company by 50%\". He did not achieve that goal, in part because it's difficult to measure an increase when you have no real base data.They are using AI as a buzzword and a way to make themselves appear like they're \"with it\". It's easy to say \"I'm going to help facilitate AI infrastructure growth\" or \"expand AI use\", but then what?I think AI is oversaturated. We had several different teams working on projects that were supposed to integrate our company data with ChatGPT (i.e. allowing business users to query company data) and then ChatGPT came out with a \"Company Knowledge\" feature (like 2 weeks ago) and all those teams are now looking for new projects to work on, but they wasted what I can only assume is months of development hours that the company paid for. This is not an isolated incident at my company - there are tons of AI projects with no real end goal other than \"enabling AI across the organization\".It's just crazy to me how many people at my company are working on AI projects, but don't really have any demand for these projects (at my company specifically).",

But there’s data engineering in all industries, within the scientific space for research, in government, industrial and infrastructure, there are even companies who’s entire product they sell to others is datasets.

It works really well within brew, so we can make a short script within the repo that can work basically from a completely fresh OS and get someone up and running in 2 minutes.Having multiple dependency groups and swapping things in and out of cached dependencies is fast, and makes it easy to switch between \"I'm doing airflow now\" to \"I'm doing local execution\" to \"I'm doing managed spark execution\".It has helper commands to get a python environment up and running with the basic configuration components, so you don't have to guess at what is needed or useful.It has brought our development processes much closer to being seamless.",

You could buy books on KPIs and every software system was pretty much designed around implementing them.

Parts aging reports that track how old stock is, and help calculate reorder amounts for future stock based on how often they get sold, plus all kinds of discounting strategies. It was rad.Now you have hundreds of meaningless reports nobody runs or reads, client-side designers so they can \"make their own\" (but still can never work out, because data is complex), and the ultimate... just ask AI for a number and let it make something up.

We ended up somewhere else in the company and the project never went anywhere lol 2 - I spent a whole day manually excluding about 130 duplicate rows from a power BI report because of an upstream issue in our product dimension. Basically it didn't contain a flag that would have resolved it.I hit some limitation of some system because excluding any more matrix rows would break the visual. So, we had to go to DE to fix it upstream anyways :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: we were told they were mid migration and wouldn't do any new work. So I explained the situation and told them it's their call. I can't do the project without the fix. So I either delay it for months or they fix it lol",

That serves as some subset of a basis for downstream transformation, a storage to replay history, evidence for reconciliation if you need it, decoupling from the sources. This is called bronze in a medallion architecture - A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the \"single source of truth\" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools. This is what most users will ever see. In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.The 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.Besides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size. Again, some will disagree.",

While vendor-created terms and patterns are not inherently bad (the data lakehouse pattern is super useful), their purpose is to provide an \"onramp\" into understanding new ideas you want the market to adopt. I say that to not get too caught up on the terms, especially if that's the main sticking point for your org to adopt (this was my case).",

I was getting tons of interviews with companies who had a 5-10 person analytics team and it just hinted to me that there was a lot less options available up the ladder3. i found i was enjoying the riddles of the data/software more than the analytics or the business decision making. i didn't want to discuss 12 variations of a dashboard or if showing sales AND inventory counts was helping... i was more interested in writing spark jobs.",

Was and still am an introvert so I really hated talking to stakeholders and making presentations.What I would suggest is to stick to it for a while since you'll learn a lot of valuable lessons and insights on what business users/team really need for their data use-case. You'll learn better how to treat data as a product which will make you a better DE imo. At least, that's my experience.",

I think good DE is what most companies need but don't realize it because it's so back-end and a lot of leadership doesn't understand how it works. The people who do understand how it works have a hard time explaining it to them and they might not have the patience and humility to listen. Which brings me to my next point. In my experience, doing DE doesn't necessarily mean I don't have to deal with people, presentations, and politics. I deal with that stuff a lot. Maybe not every DE does, but I find myself constantly put in positions where I have to coordinate with cross-functional groups of people or make presentations about how stuff works or what problems we discovered. That said, I hated the kinds of \"people\" work I had to do before, but don't hate it as much as a DE. Part of it is because I have supportive leaders who want me to do this stuff, and the other part of it is that you usually know what you're going to get out of a DE project so it's easier to propose and explain.",

At the same time I really liked the engineering part of things as the focus of my study was always on the computational side of things. At some point back then I remember getting super interested in Spark and did a small project with it. It turns out that there is another team using it already and then I joined that team as a junior data engineer.

This was not the case at tech companies, but by the time I worked there, I was software engineering anyway (data engineering -> ML Ops deployments -> software engineering), so the line was blurred. Also I studied software engineering.For your case, I recommend focusing on the 'Python' part of those skills, and doing the areas that you enjoy like pipelines and process automation. Companies have inefficient processes and need people that can understand the underlying data and the business, as much as the tech. If you can keep doing great work in those areas, without losing sight of the business context, you will do great, and lots of opportunities will continue to open up for you!",

Learn about UDFs, parquets, partitioning, merges and SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) and merge statements. API ingestion patterns and different ways you can authenticate, paginate and any frameworks. If you ho with databricks, pick Delta Live Tables, Databricks asset bundles, streaming tables etc and almost certainly CI CD. DbT would be another thing to think off.

However, if that initial part is done properly, most of the work later on becomes analytical engineering (aka, translating business needs into sql queries).Learn Polars instead of Pandas. But in fact, if you want to seriously learn DE, focus more on SQL / relational databases (for the base) + distributed computing / operational vs analytical databases.Get the books \"Designing Data Intensive Applications\" (amazing, cant recommend enough. It will give you a great understanding on why certain tools exist and why they are relevant) and \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" (from Joe Reis. Quite basic book, but great if you are starting)",

        "body": "I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under \"control\" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever. Also, there are routine things, but most of the time we are thinking in new ideas, so we are free to be creative.If you have any questions I am glad to answer them!",

The concepts you learn building in Azure Data Factory (for example) will allow you much more easily learn something like Airflow versus if you were just learning it from scratch.Also, the vast majority of companies you apply to already use at least one of these and your audience becomes a lot bigger if you are an \"Azure expert\" vs. a \"Snowflake expert\" or a \"PySpark expert\". You can definitely learn any tool you want, but you also need to consider the market and what jobs will be available when you're ready....Almost all of the major tools like Data Factory, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Snowflake, XYZ123, etc. and so on will all be around in the next couple years, but if you focus on something like dbt, for example, you're going to only have a handful of companies that use that and only like 1%-20% will give you an interview - so just keep this in mind if you learn less popular tools.",

So if you have both in house now u can charge customers to use their postgres on the promise that they will integrate seamlessly in the environment. Now with pg_lake you can get ops SLAs on your data in your iceberg lakehouse using snowflake postgres with pg_lake ala citus db. Ppl realize they don’t need snowflake of they can get close to parity with an iceberg based s3 lakehouse. So snowflake now can bring it all together under one roof and make more money.

There will be reports, there will be dashboards, there will be analytics there will be god knows what.Whatever will be the next hype cycle in the world data, companies still need their infrastructure running. As the old joke goes, whenever a data scientist joins a company, the first question they ask is 'well do you have a data infrastructure running?' and the answer is mostly no.AI/ML is really interesting and there is space for innovation. DE work is less innovation, but more hands on problem solving. I liked working in both. You can still transit from DE to AI/ML easily, you'd have a very solid foundation.I'd vouch for DE with an AI/ML flavour. If the market shifts, then you can become DE with a something else flavour (e.g. bit of analytics on side. Dashboarding maybe?). You already have an ongoing experience with AI/ML, combine that with a solid expertise in DE and you have good chances ahead I think. I'm sure i'd be happy to have someone like that on my team.Some skillset i'd recommend overal: strong grip on SQL and Python is already given for you which is great. Add understanding PySpark on top (with Spark generally), add a good understanding of a cloud provider (Azure or AWS, some relevant resources) add a data platform skill on top (Databricks or Snowflake). Get a basic understanding of OOP, maybe implement a simple pipeline platform in OOP for an example project.The market will always change and shift and we always had to adapt. Learning never stops in either field, but i agree that AI/ML is currently steeper than DE. If you cant land a DE role, go for a Data Analyst with (and i cant emphasise this enough) heavy tech skills orientation. Many business views DA jobs business only and not IT. I started off with a DA job and I was an SQL monkey for a year. I actually quite liked it, then i transitioned into DE with a very strong SQL base knowledge.i hope i could be useful.",

We don't run distributed for processing, Polars + custom Rust UDF on 2 server with 4TB of RAM each goes really really far. \"scan don't read\". Some GPU compute nodes and some lower perf compute nodes when it doesn't matter. We also use Airflow, it's fine, not amazing, not awful either.No vendor lock-in is really nice, we can deploy a whole \"mini\" version of our whole stack using docker compose for dev. Dev flow is great.Our user facing serving APIs are not on prem tho. It's just a big Rust stateless modulith with Tonic gRPC, Axum for REST and the data queries/vector queries are using LanceDB/Datafusion + object storage + Redis. Docker Swarm and Docker stack for deployment. We hit around sub-70ms P95, trying to get it down to sub-50ms it's really awesome.Most people stack is wayy to complex and wayy to overengineered.Edit: Some of the compute for ETL (more ELT) is on VPS in the cloud tho, but it feeds the on-prem setup. Edit: We do use Runpod a bit for bigger GPUs too. Buying those GPU for on-prem compared to Runpod pricing doesn't really make that much sense.",

The budget cycle is annual, so if you miss it, you could be waiting a long time. At one point while I was there, the lead time to get new hardware capacity for the on prem data lake was more than a year. So that means, you have to be able to project your needs a couple years in advance, to be able to get what you need when you need it.Needless to say, that limits how quickly you can respond to the market and changing external circumstances. It is true that large enterprises are like a huge container ship - takes a long time and plenty of advance notice to steer the ship in a new direction.Tech-wise, it is similar. Behind on latest tech due to how long it takes to get them into the company. In the meantime, use older tech that is reliable and has been vetted.",

Data is mix between Postgres/small appdbs and lots of blob storage. 2 GPU for LLM 2 GPU for other work. Probably need a few more GPU nodes depending on how much more people want to GPU accelerate. Whole stack is open source and currently dreading about Bitnami pulling up the ladder on container maintenance/closed sourcing stuff. Current stack about $300k recurring costs for software about 1k/node/year(OS License). My time and sanity however are not tied to a dollar amount. On prem for Security/cost once yo u start getting into PB scale or higher in data those cloud ingress/out fees along with storage capacity add up if you want it hot you can play with the Azure/AWS storage calculator to see. Cloud storage is great for arctic/freeze data for backups or old data costwise if you can spare it so hot -> cold cloud was always a good discussion.Took us a long time to organically set this up from scratch and bare metal and learn from scratch but I was happy for the opportunity.

It's how I start most of my new projects these days.Ci/cd, IaC, branching strategies, feature flags, tdd, etc are also critical skill sets for any engineer.Terraform is a good investment if you work in the cloud.The rest of it is moving, shaping, analyzing, and orchestrating data which is all table stakes for a DE.

Build one real pipeline: ingest NYC Taxi or NOAA data with Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub, land in GCS, load to BigQuery, model in dbt, schedule with Airflow, and publish a small dashboard; write a short readme on tradeoffs and costs.Spark is nice to know, but on GCP I’d learn Apache Beam/Dataflow first; if you still want Spark, run it locally with Docker to practice partitioning and joins on a few GB. For quick APIs over curated tables, I’ve used Hasura and PostgREST; DreamFactory also helped when I needed secure REST endpoints for Snowflake/BigQuery-backed services.Focus on one cloud and ship end-to-end; that pays off fastest.",

So now not only do you not need to mess up your computer with a bunch of installs and conflicting versions to work on multiple projects locally, other folks working on the project will have the exact same local environment as you since the devcontainer config is part of the project. And I get it with kubernetes. It takes a little work to get your head wrapped around it, but it's worth the effort. Think of it like a giant server upon which you host your containers (called pods in k8s) plus all of the tooling to make them speak to each other as needed, or share secrets, or keep them alive if they fail, or scale them on demand, or a million other quality of life things.",

You can use multi asset decorator to deal with this quite well.AssetSelection for jobs can get annoying if you have a mix of dbt source + ref tables in them. There should be an ability to override skipped materializations so that they don’t cascade down the dag override downstream materializations. If I have 3 ingestion branches that are referenced in a downstream table, if one of those branches doesn’t have new or updated data, then I don’t want to churn the tables. I wish I could in that case mark specific assets with a “Skipped but successful” status so that if there was new data in the one of the other branches the final table rematerialized to include the new data. I know in this scenario the 3 ingestion branches could be separate jobs but that feels messy.",

With this you can simply connect your end DB directly to the iceberg catalog as the front and get a good performance as the majority of them have native iceberg connectors. However for any performance critical queries you might need to apply further optimizations based on your end DB.As an example on AWS, you can use the glue catalog and S3 as a storage layer.",

But I suppose it also depends what you're trying to do with the semi-structured data...I'm mostly thinking about analytics on top of it, for which Mongo/Postgres/etc are obviously not the right fit. As far as ETL goes, I don't think it makes a huge amount of difference as long as the downstream system is capable...other than e.g. JSON docs will be much larger to transport than, say, Arrow.",

Do you just think about that or do you try to add tables that won't be used in the code yet?\\> I get quite overwhelmed with the rabbit hole of trying to make the db perfect from the start.Yes, and you need a way to \"ground\" yourself so that you don't fall into rabbit holes.\\> Is it easy to just change my schema on the run?Mostly yes. The most complicated schema change IMO is usually changing the cardinality of the link (from 1:N to N:M or vice versa). If you're just adding elements (entities, links, attributes) then it would be easy, assuming that your database does not have too heavy traffic. But even then you could use things like side tables that are trivial to create without service interruption.\\> Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better?Depending on what you mean by \"putting more efforts\".\\> How should I know is my design is already fine?Uhm, I have an entire book that tries to answer your questions. Without trying to sell it directly, here is a 9000 words tutorial on designing a non-trivial application: [https://kb.databasedesignbook.com/posts/google-calendar/#how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka-idhow-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka](https://kb.databasedesignbook.com/posts/google-calendar/#how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka-idhow-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka)Specifically, the link points to \"How far ahead do you need to think?\" section.",

I can't find a way for that except just making a long list of notes on when they took a leave, and then adding back the number of sessions they took a leave. It is a mess. After all that mess, my manager still wanted me to also keep track of transactions in the monolithic spreadsheet. Well, that's the bell for me, I need to make this right. Haha.And then I also need to synchronize this excel sheet to an external spreadsheet for my sales team, and my company is a bit warry of google, so they don't want me to completely upload everything on there, I then need to manually select them, copy them, and make sure I don't copy the wrong stuff, and it's hard to synchronize the data if sales team managed to change some of it. Well, all and all, I also think this is a great opportunity for me to learn RDB, since I didn't have any hands-on experience with it, aside from vibe-coding a project using prisma etc, which I don't have any idea about anyway.",

Partner with a university, library, or NumFOCUS for venue/fiscal sponsorship to keep costs down; publish the budget, offer low-cost tickets and travel scholarships. Build a committee with folks from DE, analytics, SRE, and ML to review across stacks. Use Discord/Slack for comms and Sessionize or Sched for scheduling.For demos, think Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms, and DreamFactory for auto-generating secure REST APIs from databases when you need to expose curated tables.For OP in the US, near-term vendor-light options: Data Council (Austin/SF), QCon data tracks, PyData, and ODSC East/West if you pick the DE sessions.Start local with clear rules and you’ll have a real vendor-neutral data conference fast.",

I cannot answer precisely on business wins as I had less exposure to end business users.From my experience, I can tell that it works well when there is a consuming/business team driving MDM with proper requirements and goals. Slowly it can evolve and become an enterprise level golden data layer by onboarding other business groups. This becomes a single source for multiple departments and business teams within an organization, this in itself solved a lot of things and improves productivity and business insights.Examples I have seen,- better(faster) customer onboarding and handling with the Customer master.- Improved vendor insights using supplier mastering.- I have not done product master implementation but I have seen a lot of top companies doing that as well.Cons:- MDM projects might fail if an organization fails to involve a business rep (MDM requires a lot of business involvement to deliver)- MDM projects unnecessarily extend and fail to deliver if an organization has short term vision- Vendor lock might be a problem as MDM is offered as a Software product- Sometimes it can be too complex- Before bringing mdm it is important to educate clients on what value MDM can provide and what are the limitations of MDM. It might sound absurd but I have seen a couple of projects cancelled midway due to this.Please let me know if my answer is naive. I am improving as a MDM Engineer and the feedback will help me.",

When you actually try to match and master records, the golden record doesn’t just magically appear; it evolves over time. Usually, it starts with picking a key domain, like customers or products, getting your sources talking, and slowly cleaning duplicates and standardizing fields.The small wins are honestly the best part: fixing just one field or deduping a batch can save hours later. The bigger insight is that MDM isn’t just about tech; it’s as much about processes, rules, and deciding who owns what data. And expect surprises or things you thought wouldn’t matter often cause the biggest headaches.",

And without somewhere to reconcile them all to one customer record, every downstream instance suffers So the MDM team creates master data tables that are referenced in ETL flows created by the date engineering So the data engineering team extracts data from a source, reconciles it against master data, and drops it in the enterprise data warehouse It's not perfect. The teams are all spread thin and the company is still not there with process maturity overall But, being able to have one team just focus on defining what the \"truth\" is with the business is awesome",

Might just be because the manager is familiar with the other people and knows what they can do, but maybe more unfamiliar with you or doesn't feel like you have the skills right now? Eventually though the project will be done and you will have to work on the new platform as the old one will be shut down. So at that point you probably will start getting work. On the flip side though maybe they don't think you have the skills to adopt to the new platform and want to make a change at that point? Only you can get a feel for this.

(Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual. It's deeply structural.",

The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes. Unless the workload as a whole requires more simultaneous executions instead of individual query performance.",

RMS is S3 storage which you don't have access to and cannot tweak - if you use S3 directly you get the benefit of using different S3 storage classes which are cheaperRedshift is far superior for analytics than Athena because of how the technology was built.

        "body": ">use string functions to extract values then arightematic('arithmetic')Agreeing with the other reply - this would be the 'good' way to do it in a real-world business situation, in my opinion.In real-world situations you don't get the choice of what data is given to you, and you won't be getting informed when new data is added. So you want to choose approaches that work for the data as it is today AND will continue to work as the data changes in the future, without you ever examining the data again later.You should have a test somewhere that all the data conforms to a general pattern of \"number + text\", then extract the number part and convert it to a database numeric type (integer or decimal, as required). Separately extract the text part, to another next column. You will then need to hard code the SI prefixes to factors: K means x1000, m means x0.001, M means x1000000, and so on. But these are a universal system worldwide, and there are only so many possible values. You should capture these in a data table that you reference or join to, rather than in code.Then do arithmetic using the numeric part as you were thinking.Hard coding would break if the data changes later once this process is in production and you've moved into a different project. Just looking at the top 10 values is based on how the data is now: a different unit might be in the top 10 next month or next year. So again, it's a fragile approach. One of the best principles I've been given by a former boss: always design yourself out of the processes you build.",

        "body": "I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this. People usually either just give up on referential integrity, or limit the time window and select everything rather than random sample.",

        "body": "I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",

We have more people with the skills than customers willing to pay for those skills sadly...even though gdpr is a legal requirement. Gdpr has many facets and some are taken less serious than others and the serious ones are easy to implement with RLS and the likes.

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",

Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky. In some highly regulated organizations that are still immature, I have seen them hire data governance specialists before they even have data teams or a CDO. In those cases, the governance expert ends up sitting under legal or some other non data function. That is where it becomes ugly.",

You can use ADO.NET for C#, odbc drivers for most other languages (ex: pyodbc for Python), jdbc drivers for Java, and so on. You don't need an API integration for SSMS, you need one for the database itself (just like SSMS provides a human friendly integration with the database). Secondly, why are you using a long outdated version of SSMS? SSMS is free.Do you mean the database server itself is SQL Server 2014? If so, that's getting close to being out of Extended Security Updates availability too (mid 2027), but upgrading isn't free and takes effort, so it may be outside your control.",

        "body": "Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. They may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. But what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like \"Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does\" or \"explain line 149 to me.\" I've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. If AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like \"this class uses a singleton pattern to do x\" you can follow up with \"what the heck is a Singleton?\"If the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.Navigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it. Lastly, you might be getting to a point where you should learn about common architectural patterns like OOP, SOLID, Dependency Injection, Layered Architecture, Clean Code, etc. Not all at once, of course.",

        "body": "Most of my job these days is reading other peoples code, figuring out what it does, identifying potential issues, and documenting what I find. I rarely have documentation, and almost never have any sort of design document. My trick is to try to find a \"start\". In the language/environment I'm in, this is often an API Map or API router. Then I start drawing or creating a map of the code flow. I'll usually start with listing classes/methods (it works in my environment) and essentially making a class map, but for methods. What parameters, can I quickly guess what it does by the name or the code? What does it return? And then I get any methods or objects that method creates or calls. I work down that list. Essentially figuring out where I am in the web of function and method calls. As far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into \"make a PB&J sandwich steps\" like this:If my pseudocode looks like this: int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){ int[] retArr; for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){ retArr[i]=i+pAddToI; } return retArr; }I might write:**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object**Params:****Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.**Returns:** Integer array**Process**: 1) Creates a integer array for return2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. 3) Returns retArr---------If there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up. Look at documentation, ask co-workers. My language is not indexed well by any AI (proprietary language, most of the documentation is hidden behind paywalls), and sometimes I do have to talk to *gasp* real people or RTFM. But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.I usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom \"Calls\" and \"CalledBy\" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents. My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a \"model\" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). The benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code. Even reading single methods and writing them out, in \"make a pb&j sandwich steps\" will help in the long run. It's certainly time consuming, and reading code and writing it down like this helps you learn how to read code more quickly.",

I tried learning when I was younger but never really understood the concepts, or maybe I didn't have the drive to put in effort. If gured if I gave up then, I'd never come back. I'll say, learning now is 100x easier than I remember, probably because the Internet wasn't as much of a thing back then.I did some Ruby to start, because I thought I wanted to make websites and it seemed like a good entry language. About a month in, I decided I didn't really need a website for anything, so I had no motivation. Shortly after, I switched to c# and then learned Unity, so I could more easily see the results of my work. It's been very rewarding, and I'm having lots of fun. But don't get me wrong, there are some times where I search for a simple answer to a question, and I have to go read a lot of docs or ask other questions to even understand what the other answers meant. I haven't considered turning my codding hobby into a career, maybe one day, but for now it's been keeping my mind engaged. Fixing \"the players name reverses when they turn to the left\" is infinetly more interesting than \"the heat in this guy's living room doesn't work\"edit: Sorry of this isn't super relevant, I'm sick so my mind wanders, but I typed it all in so I hit send.",

Both are heavy on the math but that's what you want.Stanford CS229 is available free online with full lecture videos and notes. Andrew Ng teaches it properly with the linear algebra and calculus you'd expect. MIT also has open courseware for their AI courses. The key is following actual university syllabi rather than random YouTube channels. Look up what MIT, Stanford, or Berkeley require for their AI graduate programs and work through that material in order.For deep learning, Goodfellow's Deep Learning book is rigorous. Then pick a specific area and dive into papers. ArXiv is your friend. Start with foundational papers in whatever subfield interests you, read them with a notebook, derive the math yourself. Implement things from scratch in numpy or pure Python before touching frameworks. Most importantly, work through the exercises in the textbooks.

Because of the bug, the processor would return incorrect binary floating point results when dividing certain pairs of high-precision numbers. The bug was discovered in 1994 by Thomas R. Nicely, a professor of mathematics at Lynchburg College.[1] Missing values in a lookup table used by the FPU's floating-point division algorithm led to calculations acquiring small errors. In certain circumstances the errors can occur frequently and lead to significant deviations.[2]",

If you have a data center with ten thousand machines in it, there's a really good chance that one or more of those CPUs has a core that is slightly broken and might get one or two instructions wrong some percent of the time. This is basically not a thing worth thinking about for a normal, residential computer user, but for big scaled up data centers it's a very serious issue that needs to be planned for.As an example, the problem could be as specific as \"one in a thousand times, when using a specific register, when running on core 7, the rarely-used AESIMC instruction will produce a bad value.\"",

If you do any work with embedded development, and you get down to a low enough level to start reading MCU datasheets, you'll see that they often have an \"errata\" section explaining all the things that don't quite work how they're supposed to. Usually these bugs affect peripherals rather than the core CPU logic, and usually there are ways to work around the bugs.(For instance, the Raspberry Pi company, which started out just building boards using other companies' CPUs, recently started getting into designing their own chips for the Pico series. Their first chip, the RP2040, had a buggy analog-to-digital converter that \"skipped\" certain values instead of giving a nice clean linear output. The later RP2350 fixed that, but introduced a new bug where I/O pins drew way too much current in input mode for some applications.)Modern \"state of the art\" CPUs, like you might find in a laptop or a high-end phone/tablet, are manufactured using *very* expensive fabrication processes, which have enormously high setup costs. If they find a critical bug after the CPU has already gone into production, it might cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars to fix. So there's a huge incentive to test the design thoroughly beforehand. The big companies have really expensive proprietary simulators and supercomputers to do this.They also use so-called [\"formal methods\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) to try to mathematically *prove* that a design is correct, instead of relying solely on tests which might miss edge cases.And finally, nowadays some of the actual functionality of a CPU is controlled by [microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode) rather than pure hardware. Often, the microcode can be patched while the system is running, and it might be possible to fix or work around bugs that way.",

It would always resume at an even address, potentially skipping the first instruction after the HALT.The bug didn't occur with the chips manufactured by Mostek. We reported the bug to Zilog. It ended up included in an errata in their datasheet. We just dumped Zilog for the Mostek chips. This is a pretty obscure situation and probably wouldn't cause much bad behavior on most hardware. There was an easy workaround, too (add a NOP after the HALT).",

Later versions of the processor had it working properly.Virtually all processors have a published list of errata and recommended workarounds. This can be as simple as \"if you do X, always assert reset and then do Y\" to \"this is an engineering sample, feature A simply doesnt work, if you need it, wait for production samples\"Bugs in the ISA itself can often be fixed via a micro microcode update if the microprocessor supports updateable microcode.

Before I went to uni, I mostly knew C and C++, and a bit of Python; at uni, I picked up Java and a lot more Python (and did some hacking on the Python interpreter, which means C…and was briefly exposed to more languages like ARM assembly, Prolog, and others); an early job was in PHP, which I basically didn’t know at all until I started; and for the past number of years, I’ve done very well in my career with mostly Typescript. Plus of course bits and pieces of other things like bash scripts and what not.For the most part, programming is programming and the specific language doesn’t matter so much. Until you get into ‘weird’ languages (in different directions: assembly, Scheme, Haskell…), *most* of the skills will transfer. Most of the skills have to do with problem-solving and structural aspects that don’t depend all that much on language.All of which is to say that you can’t go too far wrong. C++ is fine. Java is fine. Python is fine. Typescript is fine. Rust and Go are fine. In your career, you’ll probably use it—and then go many years without even seeing it.Do make sure to pick up SQL somewhere along the way, though. Regardless of the main language used in a system, there’s a pretty good chance that *something* at your job will require you to interact with databases using SQL, which is a *very* different experience from imperative languages with Algol-family syntax, and initially not very intuitive. (There are many dialects of SQL, so whatever you learn at first, you’ll have to learn more nuances later; but the basics are consistent across tons and tons of DB systems.)",

Thus, my first glass is in operating systems and I'm learning a ton through the projects, including client-server programming in C, IPC (shared memory and message queues), operating system design, and so much more. Note that I am doing this while I work a full-time job as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. So I'm learning from multiple angles. My focus in my program is to learn several computer science fundamentals that I missed and some new ones, and then transitioning to some more AI/ML related topics and applications in robotics, computer vision, etc.Do I think that an official masters degree in name is worth it alone? No. Don't get the masters if it's just about getting the degree. Do I think that an official masters degree is worth it for the structured learning and content? Definitely yes. I've only been in the program for 3 months and I've already learned so much. I'll take some classes on things I'm not familiar with and some new cutting edge features in computer science. Now there are some careers I'm interested in that start with having an advanced degree, but it's more of a convenience that I'll get that requirement than it is a motivating factor.Will it help your job outlook? Maybe, but it depends on what you take from it. If you have a masters or undergrad in computer science, but can't program anything or speak on certain subjects, you likely won't get the job. Believe it or not, this is a common thing that happens. This is the reason why cheating and similar is discouraged. Not just because it is dishonest, but because you won't learn anything by researching documentation and spending hours trying different things out. That's where the learning happens.The masters program I am in is Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). From what I understand, this program is very welcoming to non-CS undergrads, but you need to be able to speak on your abilities to accept the intense CS workload. If you don't know a single thing about computer science or programming, you won't succeed. Luckily, there are plenty of programs out there to get up to speed and demonstrate some basic (non-exhaustive) requirements before entering the program.Good luck, hope this helps.",

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse. The only thing I know is that I won't stop anymore and maybe it will lead to somewhere, maybe it won't but even if not then it will stay a lifelong hobby for me that I do in my freetime like I do now.",

I am definitely not confident that I will make it through my studies, I've literally spent days ans weeks spending tops 30-60min basically just reading. I find thinking about code really tricky, I give up easily or stop thinking. But granted, my studies are very fast paced and, I would argue, not suited to beginners. If I want to get good I know that I have to keep coding, writing code, understanding and structuring logic consistently. I'm very impressed by people who find ways to continue working on a problem when they get stuck, or who move on to another problem, or who, perhaps even more accurately, know which questions to ask themselves to allow themselves to actually consider the problem at hand.",

You would typically use a compiler and HLL unless you wanted to do something very hardware-specific that you couldn't get at via a HLL like C. E.g. setting up hardware via registers (like a bootloader or OS would), using very specific features directly (e.g. hand-rolling SIMD like in ffmpeg codec impls) etc.The applications of reading it are wider, e.g. performance (where it matters at this level), verifying compiler output e.g. did you hit some UB and give the compiler carte blanche to \"optimise\" your code in an unintended way? etc.It's also not that difficult to pick up the basics if you already know how a computer works, so a skill well worth having if you're interested enough. You probably won't write anything in it at work outside of specific job roles.Edit to say: ARMv8 (and ARM in general) has slightly less historical weirdness and is easier to learn that amd64 IMO, if you want to buy a cheap arm SoC or you have a Mac with apple silicon.

Hence I would personally avoid it unless you really like Data Science.* Any regrets or \"wish-I-knew\" advice before committing to one path? * I wish I studied Operating Systems in school.To be quite frank though, do what you like. All these fields are fine if you are willing to put in the hours and keep learning. I'm a web dev today. And it seems for web dev world, it's now expected with LLMs that Backend Engineers do fullstack. Note I said Backend doing full stack, not Frontend.When I look at job requirements today, a lot of employees are looking for one/two of: full stack (who is backend main - typescript + java/python), Go, C++/Rust.It does feel C++ is more futureproof though as the language forces one to actually understand how memory, pointers, etc works under the hood. And realistically most students will run away from actually learning C++ in life.",

I have separate projects for different parts.* Main program - UI / API (+web) * Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional. Then I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.I then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each \"domain\". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",

At the next juncture I decided to pick a window manager technology, so I picked KDE driven by Cmake, so then:* Make a Window class to wrangle all of the above* Build in some virtual controls for more parameters to tweak* Build an ADSR class because I totally forgot that* Lay out full suite of controls (ADSR for both filter and amplitude, LFOs, filter controls, etc)It's really just a matter of figuring out what the boundaries are between components and developing them in a piecemeal fashion.I also have a space sim engine that I'm working on if you're interested in hearing how I got from zero to \"fly around in a single ship in an empty universe\".",

That type of thing I found is more helpful just to help skip through the arbitrary setup so you can focus on the meat of the project in your own time.If you are learning purely from youtube tutorials. I would pair it with exercises and make sure there is some sort of comprehensive structure to the videos, I'm sure there are fairly thorough tutorial series available.

Are you going to want to learn to be a* front-end developer* back-end developer* mobile developer* data science* User Testing* Desktop developer* Cloud developer* API developer* Embedded systems developer* legacy developerIf you don't know where you want to aim at, it's hard to tell you what to learn. However, some places to start are basic programming language topics like variables, control structures, and data structures. Each of these will exist within pretty much every programming language. You should learn multiple languages. You should learn problem-solving skills. You should learn debugging skills, version control, and be familiar with at least one developer tool(IDE). You should also have communication skills because gone are the days of the nerd locked away in the steam tunnel. You have to be able to communicate and explain technical concepts to both technical and nontechnical audiences. You should learn how to document both your code and possibly write technical documentation. You should understand how to collaborate with other developers so that you can integrate code. Also know that everything you learn now will likely become slowly obsolete. So, expect a lifetime of constantly learning new tools, languages, and technologies.Good luck",

LLMs don’t rank pages like Google does; they interpret them.From what I’ve seen while experimenting on a few AI-integrated projects, models tend to favor sites that are semantically clean, have clear headings, simple hierarchy, and minimal clutter. They don’t care about backlinks or meta tags; they care about context clarity.Think of it like this: instead of keyword density, LLMs look for meaning density. The cleaner the structure, like H1 → H2 → lists → short paragraph, the easier it is to turn into embeddings that make sense during retrieval.It’s a mix of HTML parsing + embedding similarity. The model doesn’t want to guess what the content means; it wants to know with high confidence before it recommends it.I’ve noticed smaller sites win here because they’re often simpler: fewer pop-ups, less CSS noise, and more direct semantic HTML. Basically, the easier it is for a model to read like a human, the more likely it is to surface that content.",

When the model only has access to the static surface of the page, anything that depends on heavy JavaScript or dynamic rendering tends to get lost. It basically reduces the site to whatever is easily tokenizable.I also noticed the same complexity effect you mentioned. Once a site has too many layers, widgets, modals, marketing blocks, or “creative” layout choices, the core meaning gets buried. The model can’t reliably extract one clean representation of what the business does, so it defaults to safer, simpler sources.And you’re right about agents. They can technically navigate and interpret more, but the cost and latency make them impractical for widespread retrieval. So most LLM-powered answers still depend on very plain, parseable structure.It’s interesting to see how that pushes the web back toward clarity. It’s almost like the simpler the website, the more visible it becomes to AI.If you'd like, I can show you what I’ve been working on around [this](https://aioscop.com).",

I think it'd be your best way in the market. Hires in ERP sector are on the rise. If any of systems you worked on have public api's just build couple of extensions and push them to github before you start applying. if you dont feel entirely uncomfortable hit for mid roles. ive seen many \"seniors\" and \"mids\" that barley had skills of juniors. Or people who call themselves senior just because their on 5th year, but their knowledge is same as after one year.And remember:\\- points \"skills wanted\" are just wish list, every recruiter will tell you that, you dont need to know everything from such requirements, just be honest about it\\- on every interview say that you like to learn new things, this works great as long as you really do\\- LinkedIn is best for jobs (at least in my experience)\\- If you want to get your 'feet wet' you could go to upwork or something, but competition is massive and to get first reviews you'd need to do pretty low rates which sucks, but maybe its smaller (competition) on jobs with certain erps? not sure about that",

If you learn one language, you would nearly know all of them, with just the syntax being different.Areas:* Full Stack Development* AI* Cybersecurity* Hardware Programming* Game Development* Windows Application* Web Development* Mobile DevelopmentPick an area and then find out which language would be a better start. When you learn that language, you can create two pet projects, which will solidify your understanding of the language and also build your portfolio. In the end, upload it to GitHub.",

Also, just getting libraries to work can be a pain although package managers like vcpkg are a godsend in Windows, and with Linux, well, everything is just \\`apt install\\`.Java... well, I know it's a decent language but my experiences with it have been annoyance over the IDE Eclipse and settings things up like Gradle and Maven. So much documentation to wade through. Although, LLMs can probably help with these things nowadays.I'm a C# person myself, and I love the language and the environment, I am most productive with it. I occasionally work with Python for scripting and Javascript / Typescript is a must when working with frontend stuff. I have used C++ rarely when doing embedded stuff (Raspberry Pi) and some other things like emulators, but getting things like graphics and libraries and UI was a hindrance to me being able to do what I wanted to do.C# jobs were plenty, but now it can be difficult to get into among the sea of applicants.",

        "body": "Well I don't know what things are like now or will be like two years from now... I'll say that I learned both C++ and Java in college and nobody ever paid me to code in either of them, instead, all of my jobs were in languages that weren't taught in my colleges at all. While I can't see the future and advice is a dangerous thing, there's a good chance that you could learn C++ now and get a job in Java later or learn Java now and get a job in C++ later. Or learn both now and get a job using some other language later. Or learn both now and get a job using both later.Again, though, I learned those languages a quarter of a century ago and I don't know what things are like today. It was fun to learn both of them.Another thing I will say from my own experience... without actually doing a specific type of coding as a job it was hard for me to predict what I would or wouldn't like. Most coding I found enjoyable even if I assumed I wouldn't before-hand. So perhaps you would love being a backend engineer. For me, it was very hard to predict. I had to work on real projects with real people to actually know what I liked. I'm not sure if that will be the same experience for you or not or how common that is with others.I do get that there's jobs that will have requirements like \"Minimum years experience with \" and I can get why one would want to pick the \"right\" language as a result. I don't really agree with these requirements as a good C++ programmer should be able to be productive in Java in a week and rather proficient in a month and (mostly) vice-versa. I don't feel like you're ever really more than a couple months behind if you pick the \"wrong\" stuff to learn with.So, those are my thoughts. If you are enjoying C++, I really can't make an argument for you to not learn C++. Or just learn both at the same time. Personally, I feel like I got more out of learning Java than C++. This is because I already knew C and so learning low-level stuff wasn't as crucial for me, and I felt like the types of software-engineering challenges I personally like revolve more around managing domain complexity in which case a higher-level language lets me be a bit more focused on the stuff I like. But you could be the opposite. Only you can really know.I will also say... and maybe I'm wrong about this expectation... but I feel like university students, at least by the 2nd year, should probably be able to learn any language necessary on their own quickly without it being the main focus of a course (maybe I'm wrong about this, though.) Meaning, at that point, the language is irrelevant and not what the teacher is actually trying to teach. It's just a vessel for teaching the real lessons. I think one has to get past the language-learning part and into the deeper software-engineering challenges and other concepts at play. Not the syntax/mechanics of a specific programming language. I think learning programming languages themselves is something you should just be able to do rather quickly as-needed/desired. Along those lines, if the question is... I can take a CS course taught by teacher A using language X, or the same exact course but by teacher B using language Y, I really don't think it matters that much to be honest. If X and Y are Java and C++ then just pick C++ if you predict it will make the class more enjoyable. Whether teacher A is better at teaching than teacher B is probably more important, actually. But, I think there's a good chance you might learn the actual lessons of the course better using Java than C++ so if you really can't make up your mind I suppose I would recommend Java for that reason but my suspicion is that I don't think it will matter much in the grand scheme of things and that it's not as crucial of a decision as it seems to be at the moment.Not sure if good advice but that's my experience with this stuff.",

You can run some variants on your machine, e.g. minikube or kind, but you're immediately inundated with a bunch of object types, verbs and architecture questions. For that I'd recommend _some course_, but having learned on the job nearly a decade ago (yes, client actually started using kubernetes 1.0, before I joined), I don't know what's a good current thing to recommend.",

Docker was just a small part of it. All docker does is containerize individual processes. You can use either your own docker “images” or install them from docker.io or other registry. Images are basically just scripts to run the application. Kubernetes is a lot more complicated to understand but it gets pretty easy once you get to the heart of it. Services are what matter in kubernetes. They take the containerized application and assign an id to them. Since kubernetes deals with multiple ports if you were to handle it traditionally you would have to manually allocate ports to reroute traffic, however services work to reroute the traffic automatically to the assigned port of your application. If you want to practice you could probably use virtualbox to create a few vms and try to connect them.",

Your job prospects would be very different.Generally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.Computer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. Since it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.To go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things. Keep in mind the job market for CS grads is fucked right now but that applies to data science too so given your age you might want to reconsider. I’m not trying to discourage you from CS, I’m a CS student myself, you just have less time to wait around for that six figure job. CS is no longer finish the degree and get that six figure offer right out of uni, it takes time and extracurricular experience now just like any other degree.In your position I’d look at r/cscareerquestions and decide if that’s something you’d be willing to deal with (it’s the worst of the worst scenarios but you get the point). Then I would say do a CS degree with a minor in data science. That opens all the doors: CS as a new grad, data analysis type roles, and grad school for either discipline should you want to do that.So yeah that’s my ted talk.Edit: I also unfortunately should say that with the job market getting a degree from a random community college or even a random state school won’t cut it anymore, prestige really matters now which sucks.",

In a CS degree you'll have the chance to make it more data heavy if you want but you may not get the opportunity to do the same thing the other way round. I don't think your job prospects will be very different. They'd probably be better with straight CS since it's more general but I also don't think a company hiring for a CS position would reject someone for doing AI and DS instead. They're close enough and you're probably taking enough shared classes between them that it won't make much difference.",

So to take your factorial number, what is 7! ? It’s 7 * 6!. n! = n * (n-1)! So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)def factorial(int n):return n * factorial(n-1)Now, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block. TLDR, when writing a recursive function, act as if you already have the function working",

        "body": "A lot of the time, I find refactoring a solution really valuable. By either eliminating distractions or drilling down into the details, I can often cross the intuition gap.Using recursion as an example, let's say that I've seen the code```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```So, let's analyze: I can see exactly what happens when `$n == 1` and `$n == 2`. The default case, however, recurses, and it's not clear what that means. I can do a refactoring, making the code worse in order to look at it in more detail. For example, I can add the `$n == 3` case explicitly:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```Since I've already determined what `fib(1)` and `fib(2)` are, I now know exactly what happens with `fib(3)`.And I can keep doing this, substituting the value of subexpressions into cases to see how the expansion would work. By the time I'm at `fib(6)`, that expansion looks like this:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } when 4 { return (fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2) } # fib(3) + fib(2) when 5 { return ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1)) } # fib(4) + fib(3) when 6 { return (((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))) + ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) } # fib(5) + fib(4) default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```By making what each recursive call does explicit, I can see the relationship between the last line and the lines before it. And I can see that in every case, the subexpressions are simpler than the overall expression and lead inevitably to the base cases.Anyway. That's one technique. Might work for you, might not. But it's how I do.",

Once you've solved a few of these problems, you've solved them all (for the most part).You can turn recursive problems into none recursive problems by pushing arguments into a list, and using a for loop instead, which is pretty much what is happening when you make recursive calls. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/159590/convert-recursion-to-iterationIn general the more you know, the more you make links to things you already know, and the quicker you can learn more - the hump at the start just takes persistence and putting in the hours, to get a basis of knowledge to build out from.

Most CPUs within the same family are backwards compatible, but the instruction set (assembly language) across architecture is different. It's not just the language is different, but the registers and addresses are different as well. So different architecture requires a different binaries i.e. you need to compile for architecture. OS has the same problem, but on the other side. Your applications needs to interface with the OS, and different OS has its own quirks. For example, Linux vs windows uses foward-slash / double back-slash for paths; Windows adds a carriage return to the end of line, and Linux doesn't. There are a lot of other difference in permissions, networking, filesystem, etc. i.e. you need to compile for OS. The OS doesn't do the work for you. The OS runs on top of the processor, and can only ask the processor to do work that the processor already do eg. execute this binary. It's the same as how a mobile app is not actually doing the work but is instead asking the phone to do it. So in the same way, you have Android apps, and you have Apple apps i.e. compiled to different OS.",

Those opcode, operand instructions use the instruction set of their target processor. The opcodes are literally switch settings that direct the operands to the physical hardware gates in the cpu. Your OS is not going to do any final compilation of your program. It’s going to load machine code into an isolated virtual memory space and control physical memory storage, swap space, and cpu time vs other managed processes. It will also provide mediated access to hardware via OS calls. You still have to compile for the right cpu architecture and OS. Virtual machines like the Java JRE let you start with a semi-cpu agnostic median build that is JITted into machine code at runtime. The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard. Ultimately recompiling for x64, arm, and ppc is not actually a huge imposition.",

        "body": "I am not a REST evangelist, but the STANDARD approach to REST is that an endpoint set should refer to a RESOURCE, and a good litmus test for that is \"can I assign an ID to it without it getting weird\". And then you spread CRUD operations (create read update delete) across the verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for that resource. If you're more familiar with SQL, thinking about how you'd normalize the tables and what gets a primary key can kind of give you an idea what a \"resource\" or \"entity\", etc. would be.In your case, I'd probably have something more like1. POST /api/cart - CREATE a new CART2. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId} - Update metadata about the CART {cartId} (not necessarily its sub objects)3. POST /api/cart/{cartId}/item - CREATE a new item in cart {cartId}4. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId}/item/{itemId} - UPDATE an existing item in cart {cartId} with the id {itemId}. Your quantity update would go here.For the item model I'd probably have something like (BASIC) itemId // the id of the CART item productId // the id of the product in your catalog quantityNote I dont put things like PRICE, etc. in there: the PRODUCT linkage should let you get the price of the product in your catalog and do the math to present price information. You don't want to put things like that in your cart model, because it gives attackers a target to EDIT something they shouldn't, and suddenly they can update something in the cart to give it a price of $0. There are like a half dozen different suggestions about proper security design that go along with that, and I know you didn't ask about that, so I'm not going deeper.Also note that endpoint split is a little obvious for REST stuff, but there's others that aren't as obvious: like do you have an endpoint for SHIPPING information, OR is shipping information just part of a CART update call? ie:1. POST api/cart/{cartId}/shipping - \"create\" a shipping record for cart {cartId}?2. PUT api/cart/{cartId} - or just update the shipping information on the cart record itself?These judgement calls can be driven by LOTS of things. I might want to split shipping info updates to its own endpoint because the UI segregation of that operation vs other cart update operations kinda suggests it. Or because my DB design says that \"ShippingInfo\" is a 1:1 record with a Cart, and I want to adhere a bit to my data structure case, or dozens of other reasons.Another fun one, what type of endpoint would you use for a SEARCH endpoint? By REST standards its conceptually a GET, but robust search often becomes a POST out of necessity of supporting larger POST bodies. Plenty of GETs in a larger ecosystem migrate to POSTs to support request bodies too, because REST doesn't really deal with that, and you absolutely will hit a point where you have to send a body on a GET at some point because URLs can't support the size. Be pragmatic when its called for.Hell you don't HAVE to use PUT for updates. I've seen plenty of people only use POST as just \"POST is an upsert\" instead of dealing with PUTs at all, or reserving PUTs for PATCH operations and using POSTs for full object updates. REST purists will get all up in arms about that but... you should really ignore them. Almost no one does the pure thing in reality.",

In actual development, which framework or language to use is usually dictated by the situation. For example, if the client’s system is in JavaScript, you can’t just use Python. If they want React, you gotta learn it and use it right away. So, there’s no framework that’s definitely worth learning or should be ignored. It’s just about using the right tool to solve specific problems.My advice is, if you really like Django but don’t have a project for it right now, why not come up with your own project? Build it and keep improving it. You’ll discover a lot of cool things about the framework along the way.But if you’re not super into Django, feel free to check out other languages and frameworks. There are tons of them out there. You might find one that you really love someday.I used to mainly work with Django and Flask until I started using React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS. I can’t say this setup is the best, but I just like it. So whenever I get the chance, I stick with this combo to get the job done.",

It's very opinionated, and whereas most other platforms allow you to make important architectural and code design decisions from scratch,  Django feels like a cage.Then again,  you have already invested a big deal of time on it, so make the best out of it. If I were you, I'd probably shift to Flask, and at the same time explore NodeJs (just pick a framework.. I suggest to keep your dependencies to a minimum,  and focus on clean architecture), and possibly NextJs or NuxtJs, as they seem to be dominating the job market right now",

In the specific case of `gcc`, `-l[library]` is literally just searching a pre-configured (or specified on the command line) list of directories for a file named `lib[library].a` or `lib[library].so`. So as long as you know what your library files are named, you know what name to give to GCC. And if you don't know what your library files are named, the documentation for the library you're trying to link will almost certainly tell you.Reading the documentation is *huge* in programming, so get used to starting there when you want to know how to do something.",

Instead, build systems such as [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) or [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) are used, which can take care of this for you.

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.To reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.The linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. In order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for. You see, in their infinite wisdom, the people who created this concept forgot that it would probably have been a good idea to either keep the name of the necessary library files *in the header file* somewhere. Instead, you have to read the documentation to figure these things out yourself.",

He covers this dilemma, among other things, but one of the core principles of learning something deeply is to learn it directly. In other words, you should try to learn something in as close as its real-world application (whatever that means for you) as possible. What that looks like in real life is tackling that problem/project/assignment much earlier than when you feel ready. When you hit the concepts that you don't know is a signal to drill down *JUST ENOUGH* to overcome the hurdle in what you are currently doing. This means you will spend a lot of time in that uncomfortable space but what is often left unsaid is that is the exact space that learning solidifies. In fact a lot of the times the comfortable space is a lie; we trick ourselves into believing because we read and/or took notes on something we understand it, but the truth is if that knowledge is not applied it will decay extremely quickly.",

This is safer and less stressful than trying to update everything at once. For example, many times when updating a library or framework, there will be some deprecated functions - like version 9 of some library contained theOldWay and theNewWay, and either one worked. Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changesOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",

        "body": "You start by having a very good test suite at all levels (unit, functional, integration, e2e).Then you decide where you want to land with the refactor, and you plot out step by step how you're going to get there. The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.Then you execute.Sometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.You also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",

Later I refactored the apps to use next-intl.I did the page router to app router conversion twice.Updating react-native on the other hand... Sometimes you just have to create a new project and copy the src folder over, else no chance of getting it to work.Again: Read documentation.

Computers, to begin with, have no concept of \"line\" and even less of \"curve\". They only have pixels - grid coordinates and even these don't mean anything to computers. Even if they had the concepts of \"line\" or \"curve\" and the math built in, they would still need to interpolate through several algorithms to produce the output on their natural display grid.If you were to hand draw your line, your hands intrinsically and sub consciously do very complex calculations similar to what computers do, plus, contrary to computers, you have your visual feedback loop. Try drawing a curved line in pitch dark as this is basically what a computer can see - nothing. Have you ever tried to draw a curved line on an \"Etch-A-Sketch\"? Similar problem. Or, get a CAD program to precisely draw your curved line. Or, get a 3D printer or a CNC machine to follow your curved path. All these are far from simple.Curves in general are no trivial math, no matter what algorithms or what curve systems you use. Every trigonometry or math professor will tell you that.What we humans classify as \"simple\" doesn't mean it is really \"simple\" in an objective manner.Computers are generally very dumb devices that are only good in one thing: calculatingYou have to tell them every single minuscule step that they have to perform.Once you accept that computers are extremely dumb and that you have to tell them every minuscule step you are on the right track to becoming a programmer. Stop assuming things, stop classifying things. Nothing ever is as \"simple\" as we humans see it. On the other hand, a task that might be impossible for you, like calculating with huge numbers, is trivial for a computer. Human classifications are worth nothing.",

None of that is what makes skateboarding fun or interesting to most people. Barely anyone actually use a skateboard to move up and down the street but getting started will involve a lot of just going up and down the street.The same is true with coding. Almost no-one will write code to draw a curved line. But in order to get to the point where you don't need to do that yourself you have to get through the basics. The \"struggle\" you describe is part of how you learn. Everything is difficult until it isn't. Try to find accomplishment in getting something \"simple\" to work. Because while it might be simple to a more experienced coder it wasn't simple for you.",

They only care about crunching data in the Fetch, Decode, Execute pipeline. Your computer only sees machine language. Programmers model people’s problems into computer memory and give the computer the calculations they want ran in that data and then tell the computer how they want they processed data returned. The language you do this in almost never matters and generally just comes down to personal preference or industry standard. Learn how to solve problems, read technical manuals and understand basic computer science concepts and choose languages that best help you personally model, process, and serve the results of that data the way they you want.

I, for example, would much rather write system plumbing than mess around with web browser JavaScript. Neither of them is more \"real\" programming than the other.Now, let's talk about software engineering, which might be what you're thinking of when you say \"programming\". It's a different discipline that **involves** programming but is mostly defined by turning programs that work well enough that they solve **your** problem into products that can solve the problem for more people. It very well might be that you would not like doing that. I do: I like figuring out how to make people's lives easier, which usually starts with helping them understand what is making their lives hard. I like a perfectly-tuned deployment that is memorialized by nothing but a line in a changelog somewhere.

It really doesn't matter, except that scripting is sometimes associated with people who lack comprehensive programming skills and often just copy and paste code without truly understanding why it works. Programming is more associated with the capability to write a full program from scratch and understand every bit of it. Also, sometimes scripting is the label when you are required to code more in short bursts, like attaching a little bit of code to some object like an event. It gets more into ego, and personal preference usually. What matters is that you are effectively writing code not really so much what you'd like it called.",

Does something need adjustment?* And every time you implement a box, try to think of the caller as something that can never now about the innerworkings of the box. This forces you to have clearly defined borders.* Now repeat this all the way down.

Probably not - I would say most students have these. In that case, constructors without these parameters seem rather pointless. Does it make sense for a student to exist with no classes taken? Potentially, yes, especially if they're just enrolling. In that case, perhaps you could have a constructor overload with that parameter missing, making it optional.Don't cover every conceivable case. Cover every *sensible* case. What makes sense to be optional? What makes sense to be mandatory?",

You kind of design your classes with constructors and methods, while thinking: \"Oh, and it would be nice if I could just write code like ...\"Example:If you want your student-admin system to be able to be written like: Student student1 = new Student(\"John\", 13, 7); // John is 13 years old in grade 7. student1.takeClasses(\"English\", \"Maths\", \"P.E\", \"Home Economics);Then you need a constructor that takes just the name, age and grade, as well as a method for taking a number of classes.If you also want to be able to write something like: Student student2 = new Student(\"Jane\"); student2.setAge(14); student2.takeClass(\"English Litt.\"); student2.takeClass(\"Woodworking\");Then you also need a constructor that only takes the name - as well as a method for taking a single (additional) class and add to the list of classes.So there are rarely any right or wrong answers - you simply build your classes so you make it as easy as possible to write the rest of the code the way you want!",

You can tweak parameters but not diagnose why something works or fails. You’re using black boxes inside black boxes.When things go wrong (vanishing gradients, exploding losses, convergence stalls), you’re stuck Googling fixes instead of reasoning from first principles.

More difficult subjects will need more breaks, easier ones, less.Even though I'm not really a fan of it, I'll suggest the *Pomodoro Technique* here to start. You can always extend the intervals later.Also, it is far more important to stay consistent and do something every day, even if it is just a short time. Studying for 8 hours straight today and then not doing anything for several days will not help. Doing 1-2 hours per day consistently is far more efficient.Don't focus too much on theory.

It doesn't tell me WHICH shift has changed so I have to look at EVERYTHING. If I pick up a shift from the open ones, it doesn't notify my manager that that shift has now been filled - this is \\*basic\\* stuff. And there's more ... It is the shittiest most awful app and is in fairly common use, I can't imagine why :/",

So communication wise I think I’m solid, I’m not afraid to ask questions or anything like that. I guess not waiting to be told is probably a big one, but I’m assuming that may be slightly attuned to after getting the role? They realize they made a solid choice on the jr hire when he’s wanting to take initiative within bounds and really understand what’s going on and stuff. I really haven’t had much experience doing that. But, during those projects I’d have tons of people doing the opposite of that; people on their phones, sleeping, or just doing nothing. The majority worked, but it was a pain getting the ones who didn’t care to be there to do anything.",

Who's gonna be better, a guy who uses AI only or a guy who actually knows what the hell hes doing but is using AI to do the bits hes too lazy to do?The thing is, theres a fundamental flaw in these LLMs. Im not educated enough to know if this can ever change, but the fact is, they dont produce the absolutely 100% correct answer. They produce the most common answerAnd most people are not that good, thats what average means. The average person is average. Roughly half are below average roughly half above, but onky the top 10/20/30% are considered actually good at things. Thats why we have \"AI slop\". The code it produces, unless its ridiculously common boilerplate code i.e. set up code for projects, it tends to be pretty much useless. At my job currently ive had two solve two problems, offline mode, and push notifications to progressive web apps. Theyre basically largely untouched areas. Theres few apps or codebases that deal with either of those, compared to a lot of other bits of code. I tried turning to AI and it was literally, no exaggerartion, useless for the infrastructure and logic side of things. What it has been helpful for is instead of having to sift through 100 websites and/or documentation and/or books and/or youtube/video tutorials for foundational things, i can use chatgpt and claude. And even then the free models are utterly useless. Ive had to pay for a monthly subscription because it takes about 10-20 attempts for it to give mr what I need.",

Then once you download and install the game engine, usually within the main interface, there's an icon with a link to their online manual. Bookmark that manual and start reading it as fast as you can. Then I'd see if that game engine has a YouTube channel or somewhere where they're posting free engine learning content, possibly their own website, and I'd pick a couple of their 'how to make game x' or 'how to make game y' series (usually varies by genre), and watch it about 3.5 times-5.7 times. If you have photographic memory, you may only need to watch the series 1.1-2.3 times, and I'm so jealous by the way. I don't have photographic memory. Then start making your game.",

It really forced you to try and understand and reason about what each step of the \"code\" was supposed to do and its effects, instead of just sitting with an editor doing pure trial and error, changing random values and variables when stuff doesn't go your way.I think the best way of learning, is to try to be as conscious and intentional about every decision you make along the way, and when it goes wrong, try to understand what in your reasoning process went wrong, rather than \"just\" be happy that u could fix it.",

You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential informationYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.But don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.> while also avoiding wasting too much timeThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, \"wasting time\" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",

Make one project not more than 2hrs from YouTube, don't try to make the entire software now. 3. Now you have intuition from the video how react is used in a project. Now build a simple login page or very small functionality using question-driven development. 4. Now do the same with any backend framework. I would recommend you go with Node js or express js as you don't need to learn another language. 5. We have other frameworks for Java, Python as well. 6. Why use framework. They make development easier. You just have to build the functionality. Everything else will be handled by a framework, you can think of them as template which you can use to create functionality.Every thing like routing, modeling layer will be defined in a framework(If you are not able to understand routing, modeling layer, middleware etc) don't worry you will learn with time.DO GOOGLE ABOUT JIT(JUST IN TIME LEARNING) OR QUESTION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT.

So what testing do you lack? Some questions to help you move forward:* Are those business functionality tests using an actual db or an in memory mocked db? If not using an actual DB, you could do simple CRUD actions via the DB layer, and make sure the DB you're using has the same schema as what's used in production.* What does the code coverage for the DB layer look like? Using that as a template, try to get high code coverage (5-10% of your DB code will be exception handling that is hard to reproduce).",

For instance, that the data returned is what I expect it to be after applying filters, JOINs, etc. Data modification actually takes places, and so on.This is also interesting for me because the library itself is rapidly changing, and breaking changes could be introduced at some points.The data that I used for the business logic is not in a database. They are fixtures that I reuse across the tests. I cannot use alternatives such as SQLite instances for the tests, testcontainers, etc due to the ORM. Also I cannot change the connection String to point the mocked DB because the ORM and the DB are tightly coupled together.",

Haskell has lazy eval, is functional, has great support for ADTs, interesting ad-hoc polymorphism system with type-classes etc. lot of those are things which you can realistically never have any experience with from JS/TS and it will enrich you to learn them.C is basically lingua franca of systems programming, everything has to interact with C ABI at some point so it’s worth knowing it. You can also learn about manual memory management that way. It can also teach you lot about parallelism if you start doing multiple processes and multiple threads. Again those are things which you won’t have any experience with from TS and it can help a ton to learn them.Beyond that learning a bit of assembly is always worth just because it can demystify bunch of stuff. Scheme and C++ are both very interesting if you want to learn what cool stuff you can do with compile time meta programming, since they these languages are kinda kings of that. Erlang and co can be interesting because of the OTP and in general CSP/Actor style concurrency. Learning prolog can be pretty interesting educational experiment since the whole highly declarative style of programming is very unlike anything you might see elsewhere. Elm is also really interesting take on declarative UI programming. Idris is amazing take on dependent type systems. Rust is obviously pretty cool and popular take on affine types etc. There is abundance of cool languages which can teach you a lot.The holy trinity of corporate languages (Java, C#, Go) are not particularly interesting, nor can you gain a bunch of great insights from learning them… Sure maybe some things about parallelism can be learned, and Java and Go are both decent enough takes on the whole CSP concurrency model, but mostly they are kinda boring, which is kinda the whole point of languages like that. Just ALGOLs with a coat of paint on (in C#’s case very ugly and bloated coat of paint).",

Both are really interesting once you get something initial on the screen. Use whatever programming language you want for it. But since you're after a new programming language AND want to branch out from the web dev side, try C# or C++. Or if you want to get wild, try creating something on Arduino board. There it should also be easy to test how to write stuff in Assembly language.Any of those will teach you a lot about how computers work on lower level, and how to get things running in realtime. Lots of fun! :)If none of that tickles your pickle, then try Go.",

        "body": "Here is a recent comment I made on Assembly, with some book suggestions. Tldr: \"Programming From The Ground Up\" is a good starter assembly book imo.Assembly is very useful if you have a need to craft custom executables without trying to wrangle a compiler. Having control to the byte level of an executable can be handy.For example, I have written x86 assembly in recent years to solve 2 problems.1: I wanted to make a hobby OS that can run on BIOS based computers, and to get that going, I needed a MBR (master boot record). So I wrote a 512 byte MBR in x86 assembly, since an MBR needs to be exactly 512 bytes, with a signature at byte 512. No idea how I could have done that in C or any other language.2: I wanted my Python program to export executables for vintage computing platforms. Think MS-DOS, C64, etc. I did not want my program to rely on cross-compiler packages or any of that crap. So, I used assembly to craft some executable code that would look for video data at the end of the file. I assembled that into a machine code blob, and have my program encode video data and append it to the blob when I want to export an executable. Now my program can spit out custom DOS and C64 programs, with 0 dependencies for the user.I found the book \"Programming From The Ground Up\" quite useful for getting my feet wet with assembly. After that, the books \"Advanced MS-DOS,\" \"EGA/VGA: A Programmer's Reference\" and \"Zen of Assembly Language\" became useful.Other obvious modern uses for assembly language are writing compilers, language virtual machines, reverse engineering, writing exploits.If you are writing for a microcontroller and need to use as few bytes as possible, assembly is the best way to optimize for space.As far as I know, hardware IO ports (x86 only?) are only accessible through assembly. C functions that do this wrap assembly code. This is necessary for writing some hardware drivers where memory-mapped I/O is not an option.If you want to try 6502 Commodore 64 assembly, this site has some great resources: https://codebase64.c64.org/",

You would then need to inform the players with the IP and port to connect to.Slightly harder. Use a tool like ngrok to create the network forwarding connection, just means that you need to run both the server and the ngrok client on the same machine really. You would then need to inform the players of the ngrok endpoint to connect to.Next level up, run the server on some cloud hosting providers like AWS, GCP, IBM, Heroku, or the many others. The easiest would be a containerized deployment. A Binary install would also be possible. Many providers have a trial or free compute tier you could use for a period of time. You could then have the clients connect to that and be able to discover the server and the game.There are plenty more options available all at increasing technical understanding requirements and cost.",

Don't do encryption at first; just get it working.- Can you open a server and talk to it from a client on the same computer?- Can you talk to the server from multiple clients on the same computer?- Can you open a server and talk to it from another client on the same LAN? (Maybe ask a friend / family member to loan you their laptop for testing if you only own one PC, or get a cheap old PC / Raspberry Pi / whatever for a second system)The next big jump is talking to a client in another location. I recommend trying the \"traditional\" process first:- Set the host machine to have a fixed LAN IP address- Set your router to forward connections to that port from the Internet to that machine- Figure out your public IP address (e.g. whatismyip.com )- Connect from outside (e.g. rent a VPS for testing, or take your laptop to a coffee shop)The point of this exercise is that you, personally, understand how to open a port on your PC.Now you have to make a choice:- If your target users are fairly technical, you can just tell them \"You have to open port 5123 (or change it in the config file if you want a different port)\". That's perfectly fine; technically knowledgeable people expect any server software to listen on a port, and understand how to expose ports to the world.- If you want to target non-technical users, you have to look into firewall hole-punching using technologies like UPnP or STUN. I'm not super familiar with the details; you'll have to do some research.Honestly, if you're targeting non-technical users, it's probably easier to simply rent a VPS and have users connect to it.If you rent a VPS and register a domain name, you can set up a standard HTTPS cert with Let's Encrypt, then use an nginx reverse proxy to do the actual encryption. There are plenty of tutorials of how to do this on the Internet, and LLM's understand how it works, so you can ask them questions about the details.If you don't have a domain, or for self-hosted servers, [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77510803/how-to-make-a-simple-https-server-in-p) is how to get started doing HTTPS in Python (as opposed to using nginx). Note, you have to generate a key / cert on the server, and then you have to somehow get the server's certificate to the client.",

THANK YOU for posting this here. I think a lot of people get really depressed, attack themselves, and really start going through personal stuff when all along it's a matter of timing. I see a lot of you with fantastic skills wondering why you're not able to get an interview. I'm rooting for everyone of course but hopefully info like this helps with some much needed self-esteem and confidence.",

Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.Why the \"layoff\"? - to improve the Q3 numbers. The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated. Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.It got so bad that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.The whole place just sucks. Everyone is now only about making their numbers. No help. No camaraderie. No extra anything. It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it. You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.Senior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping. Guru guy quietly says that management can't be trusted and will probably lay off again the when the Q1 slack hits. He thinks it will probably be him as he still makes more than most. But nobody knows.No one raises any issues at meeting. The life has drained out of the place. It was a fun an exciting job. The call will come just before your shift starts.Management lies at every call. They talk about the heavy forecast and how much work is coming. - Exactly like they were before the layoffs. They are probably just saying it to convince the people above them. Its such an obvious act now that you know to look for it.Keep your head down. Shut up, do you work. Spend your free time studying and looking for a better job. Don't make any large purchases and save every penny. Canned?

That's tough, man, it's going to be hard. At the very least you need a strong backend-side.* Speaking of strong backend, I just don't see it anywhere. your CV looks very mid, a lot of the projects that you listed or the work that you did looks like something that could be a basic class. How about a 20k LOC Golang + AWS + Fullstack project?* I don't think your CV is the worst, it's very mid, but that just doesn't cut it in this market, what did you do for almost 5 years? Your CV comes off as stuff people learn in a bootcamp in 6 months* Look at what companies are looking for in the area you are looking at. I know that AWS + Golang should be a strong combo, can you tailor your resume to that? Maybe some projects related to that? Again, highly dependant on your local area",

The little service an engineer wrote in 3-4 months now has a billion lines of code (slight exaggeration), supports tens of millions of customers, has 150 API options for various business lines, etc.It's just complex. The interconnected everything. You can't understand until you're looking at some small catalog system for some small product, and realize that little baby thing is probably 10x more complicated than anything you've looked at ever.The scale is just intense.",

I broke it by violating some pretty basic React rules, so if you know React you should be able to fix it.For the backend I chose a hackerrank test from the list of available tests. Mostly everyone who has taken it has at least done decently.Only a few people have taken it so far, so I’m really only getting initial data here. About 1/3 of the people have been able to fix the sorting in React. It’s only two files, it’s a fairly small code snippet, and you have about an hour to do the test.The interesting thing is the backend test I chose from hackerrank. It’s a beginner level question, our project is pretty frontend heavy and we are moving a lot of logic to the backend. We need someone strong in frontend who is at least somewhat competent on backend.Since it is an easy question, it tells you to create a class, what to name the methods, and what they need to accept as arguments… then it flags everyone’s answers as plagiarism because they are all exactly the same.",

It leads to these weird, tone-deaf, or even offensive interviews that test nothing about actual engineering.I’ve had interviewers throw trivia-style questions or ask me to debug something they themselves didn’t understand. The frustrating part is that it feels like they just want to flex rather than collaborate. Good companies use interviews to measure how you think and communicate, not how well you memorize obscure stuff.At this point I treat interviews like noise, one bad experience doesn’t mean you’re not good enough, it just means you hit a broken process. I practiced and interviewed using StealthCoder to focus on explaining my reasoning clearly instead of chasing random trivia. It gives hidden hints and structured solutions so you can focus on communication and problem solving, which is actually what real interviews should value.You’re right, these companies need to fix their process. A lot of great engineers are getting filtered out for nonsense questions while the best hires are the ones who can actually reason and work with others.",

I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. Sorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path.",

Maybe there’s a path to grow within your current company and reach the salary range you’re aiming for; if not, I’d still keep your resume fresh and casually apply for better-paying opportunities on the side. You could also try the strategy that developer used to land *remote* roles — the steps are here: [remote](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/). Another angle is building a profile on Fiverr or Upwork and quietly taking on small projects for a few months; it could realistically provide some helpful extra income. Staying alert and getting involved in different projects whenever possible is probably the smartest move right now. A lot of folks here make it sound like everyone should have a six-figure job out of the gate, but that’s just not reality. Keeping this job for a bit, building your resume, and reassessing in a year or two can set you up for something much better. Having any experience on your resume at all is already a huge advantage in this market.",

If by the time I can get a suture, the issue is manageable, I am probably just going to stick with what I already have.All that to say that the popular product isn't always the best one, it is the familiar one, and familiarity comes from time. People don't always seek the best, they just care that their needs are met.or tdlr: get me something now and fix it later",

Might get a handful of people trying to weasel through on a VPN, but it would at least create a barrier, and I’m sure the HR folks that review the resumes and stuff would appreciate not having to sift through 90 resumes of ineligible applicants just to find the handful of eligible ones interspersed throughout.",

I mean, I totally understand what you're saying, but what you say to them sounds dismissive of the teams time, because they don't leave early, and it's scheduled on your calendar. You essentially just told them, \"I can leave when I feel like it.\"Think about the context - 'how would you handle situations where people argue'I think they want to hear about a situation where you actually handled it, because that's the person that they want to hire - someone who was able to manage the situationSo, if anything, now that you know that question can (and probably will) come up in a future interview, i'd prob be prepared with a diff story. If that's just what you do normally and don't really have a story that applies, then that's just how it is, should you make something up?Now that I think of it, a similar question that i've been asked is like, 'how do u handle a difficult coworker, or disagreement with a coworker'. Fortunately, in my career, those moments are few and far between. And that's what I express - but i still have to come up with something, i just have to tap into some really really old examples. My response is usually \"you know, i've actually been fortunate enough to work with engineers that collaborate very well together and so i can't tell you a definitive situation recently where our disagreement on xyz was so strong.\" And so i give maybe an old story and how i generally work it out, and really if things escalate to where it gets out of hand, that's what our manager is there for.",

Worried about good development practices, but don't even know how to connect your current task to the billions of design architectures out there? Toss out an overview of your current goal as a prompt asking for suitable design considerations and see what usable suggestions there are, then look into those directly.

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week. Being a good communicator is critical here (as in many big techs).PIPs do happen but you should give yourself some credit - passing the interviews and getting an offer is not trivial and it means that you have a good shot at succeeding.It opens doors for you career-wise in tangible ways (learning new skills) and intangible ways (brand recogniziton, relocation opportunities to the US, that kind of thing). Depending on your goals and lifestyle values you might find that it's a smart move. Good luck!",

For Atlassian, do you at least still get hired into a craft (BE/FE/FS) or did they get rid of that? They have plenty of fully-BE and platform work (mostly Java/Kotlin or Go), but I don't know whether as a new grad you'd be able to steer you assignment towards it under the new system.TBH, I'd probably go for Bloomberg between those two because if you're willing to commute from Queens or a non-hipster part of Brooklyn. As long as you're not trying to get an apartment Manhattan or a total spillover area, you can live a LOT better on $190k in NYC than you can for $175k in the Bay Area - SF and Manhattan are both ridiculously expensive, but rents in livable parts of NYC fall off in price a lot quicker than the Bay Area does, and you don't need to have the expense of a car.Edit to add: what is the Bloomberg comp breakdown? Atlassian will be cash + stock + bonus (for new grads, both end-of-year and starting) while Bloomberg is not public. That means Bloomberg is a more cash-heavy than Atlassian, right? That can be a good or a bad thing depending on how much you see the upside in equity comp. Personally, I'd choose the cash.",

I barely write any code, the occasional automation, but it’s mostly yaml config type stuff. Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school. As others have said, it’s something people usually choose to get into later in their career, it assumes a lot of underlying knowledge, it’s high stakes, and it’s not the type of work everybody enjoys or excels at. I know the job market is hard and you take what you can get, but I’d definitely try to get on a different team, or take the job and immediately continue looking for something new before you get pigeon holed. Don’t let what happened to me happen to you.",

Not sure what kind of startups you guys are joining, but I’ve worked at startups in pre series A funding, series B funding, and I’m about to join one at series E. The companies in the earlier rounds were an absolute goldmine for learning opportunities. At smaller startups, you typically have to wear many hats, if you can’t do a little bit of everything and be flexible in your work then you’re not as valuable. They’re also a fun, exciting, and different work environment than large companies. There are a lot of desirable reasons to work at a startup. I’ve also worked at large companies (30,000+ employees) and my experiences there were largely terrible in comparison to the startup life. I always really enjoy going into work at startups, you make really close connections and you build cool stuff. It’s very fulfilling and rewarding and you don’t feel like a cog in the machine. That being said, I’ve been laid off twice due to companies going under. There are many reasons to join a startup - stability is not one of them. Just my 2c.",

They proceeded to do a few more funding rounds that changed our valuation of $8B -> $9B -> $17B -> $24B -> $39B in the course of about a year due to the pandemic. Then they hired a few finance people that would help us IPO and we started to realize what our actual valuation was as we did 409a’s (I think that’s what they were called? Idk, someone correct me…) which were basically outside companies estimating valuations. Our value went on the path of $39B -> $35B -> $29B -> …. All the way down to $8B. Then we IPO’d at $10B and by the time we could sell shares it was around $9B.When I joined I got a promotion (SWE -> Senior SWE), then got promoted to their Senior SWE II, then promoted to manager. I ended up making roughly market value for the Bay Area which felt crazy considering I joined a company that went public and at the time of IPO I had been at the company longer than like 75% of the company. Happy to have reached a liquidity event, but would have made more money if I had joined big tech. Also I got taxed at a higher rate because my 3.5 years of stock got taxed as if I made it in one year.It was way more fun than big tech though. Our companies Blind account was sooooo entertaining.

They needed me! I would do things like come right in to work after a red eye flight. Cut short holidays with family. But she even discouraged me from taking a week of PTO for a once in a lifetime professional opportunity. (I don’t want to dox myself, but I was part of a professional organization in my spare time, who provided the opportunity. So it was “personal” and not directly job-related, but job-adjacent, and would have been a unique experience that probably less than 1,000 people in the country have had. I wasn’t in CS at the time). I deeply regret not pushing it. It’s honestly one of my biggest life regrets.I’ll never work a job again where there is any response to a PTO request other than “yes”. Obviously, I give adequate notice and am ok with working together to ensure there’s coverage over holidays etc. But this whole attitude toward PTO is a huge red flag for me.Maybe you’re a bit stuck for the moment, but I’d be looking to leave ASAP.",

There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/There are also tech roles that are don’t require coding. But those are also very competitive, partially driven by a lower number of positions.",

Building things with words and watching the computer spring to life to do your bidding is magical, in a sense. Not enjoying that basic part early on says your tolerance for it might be too low for an industry that prides itself on burnout.However! There are a lot of cushy, well paying jobs in literally every field. And, in most of these jobs, you will find that having a working knowledge of scripting, data manipulation, and basic structures can give you a MASSIVE advantage.My advice: find something you want to do. You’re 26. I’m sure you at least have interests that could point you toward something career wise.Love travel? Become a photographer or something that lets you utilize it. Use scripting to manage your catalogs more efficiently, making your website and portfolio presence stand out more with some web development, etc.I started out loving coding.Then, over the years, I started loving it less.Then it went to apathy.Now I actively dislike it.This was only after ten years. I wish I had gotten my creative writing degree and done what I wanted with my life instead of chasing money.TL;DR: the industry sucks right now. It’s not the slam dunk it was five years ago. If you already don’t like it, maybe give it another six months to a year, but just bail. Do something else. Get a degree in something you want to do, or even a business degree and start your own company doing what you want to do. So many options. CS is not always the best.",

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it. Otherwise you’re in danger of coming up with tests that are meaningless but pass and create false coverage.",

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

For that 4 months I wasn’t interviewing, I would cancel interviews last minute because I was too scared. I didn’t tell anyone about that situation and would pretend to go to work in the morning. Thinking back now I was probably depressed. I forgot what changed but all of sudden I would start talking to recruiters and after a few interviews, landed a job that would pay me over twice as much as I was getting at my previous job.

Once when the whole 5 man engineering team spent a week trying to find a memory leak and I found it for example.My proudest, though, was when I worked in Germany. I was just a junior and my company was sending a guy from the German head office to the SF office to solve their performance issues. They sent me and one other guy, because he was their top guy, and I was a native English speaker. I was basically there as his assistant. But I actually identified and fixed the problem, 3 days into the week visit.

I'd originally planned to have it do bar graphs, pie graphs and line graphs but ran out of space on my floppy disk and had to make a copy of the project and do the pie graphs on another floppy. I wrote some rather cheesy input routines to input the data and drew the graphs using the Apple Pascal Turtle Graphics library that came on the floppy disk. By the time I was done I was bumping up on memory limits so badly I had to swap the keyboard routines out to disk. So every time you hit a key, the floppy drive would flash briefly.Only good thing about that year in school, the project probably kept me from going insane. Everyone was quite impressed with it -- most of the rest of the class opted to do something like Tic Tac Toe in Basic or Fortran. I'd opted to take a couple of programming classes over the summer by that point and could see the difference that they made. Wish I'd kept a print-out of the source, I'd probably get a laugh out of how bad my code was back then. But you know, we all start from pretty much the same place, so I wouldn't be ashamed of it. It'd just make me realize just how far I've come.",

You'll just have to try it.Betting on \"a field\" to keep you safe - is a direct line to mediocrity (which isn't a safe place).\\> I just want to understand the realityThere's a lot of people who are just right out of high school and have no real life experience looking for some \"sure bet\" - in a world they know very little about. They need to just explore and live life and find their path. That's what college is for. Then there's a lot of jaded people. The angry people are always the loudest. So, if you want to know the reality - get your hands dirty. Be real. Figure it out - and stop listening to the hordes of people generalizing everything. Get together with some humans and talk about the field and the career and see if it's a direction you're willing to spend some serious time exploring - or pick something else.",

I'm not sure why people think software engineering would be any different.>I just want to understand the reality of things before I startHere's my free advice for you: start teaching yourself how to code first. Do it as much as you can. See if you like it. If you think it's cool and you enjoy it (despite it being confusing and difficult at first), then enroll in some CS courses and see if you like the coursework. If you do, then jump into a full-time CS degree program, and try to do at least one internship while you're enrolled. Once you graduate, based on how well you did in school and the quality of your resume, you just might end up with a job after graduation.On the other hand, if the *only* thing drawing you to this field is the potential payday, then things might not look as good for you. The sheer competitiveness means people who enjoy this stuff are going to have a leg up since they're more likely to excel and stand out.",

Base salary increase is nice, but make sure there are stock options available for you at the new place because that is your incentive to make the place a success.Bottom line, the major advantage of an established company over a startup is that established companies can offer more stability (less likely to miss payroll, less likely to close up shop entirely, etc).

Azure is _more_ than thriving.Second, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",

Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more \"efficient\", which actually means \"overwork the shit out of people\"3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market.

If you are stuck, reach out to people. Say it in stand up why you are stuck. Make questiosn and investigate while you wait for help so you dont waste the older engineers times. If you are pressed odds are they are even more pressed. \\- Show your work, this is key. WHen you finish a task, ask for 10 minutes post stand up and show a video or show your work.

If you’re having trouble finding another job, but you have the flexibility in your current position, starting looking into creating bigger projects for yourself. You can either discuss this with your team or manager or you can look into any other tools/integrations that you can introduce to help boost your company’s business. Your contributions will help make you stand in today’s tough job market.",

        "body": "Did this about a year ago. SA / sales-adjacent roles were not on my radar at all, I had 8YOE as a SWE. I just thought the role sounded interesting and applied. In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet. I have zero regrets about the transition in because of what I gained financially. I may try to transfer into a SWE role once I’m able to though.",

They're likely going to want end the interview feeling that you can competently architect and implement solutions on Azure. And if you've done this on AWS, chances are you won't struggle with Azure. But you'll need to sell the interviewers on this.Differences in the major services across AWS/Azure seems reasonable. S3 vs Blob / EC2 vs Azure VMs (and all of the sysops stuff orbiting both) / Glue vs Fabric -- you get the picture. So you can confidently address things like \"well, we did it this way with Glue at current employer for these reasons, but my understanding is Fabric handles X Y Z differently, so we would adjust the approach in A B C ways for D E F reasons if we were to reimplement\".> Postgres * MVCC * Complex and composite data types * JSONB * Object relationsIn my experience this is all pretty surface-level stuff that practically any RDBMS would force you to learn if you're building anything moderately complex with it.

It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\\_job\\_search\\_2\\_month\\_long\\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs. So you do get screwed in job searches as a pure generalist.Keep in mind specialist in some outdated garbage is the worst of all worlds.",

That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it. I want the experience that comes with it. Diversity of experience is very good.Long story short, I vote for doubling-down, but occasionally pivoting.",

They may understand what the code is doing, but never understand why AI decided on its approach. So if asked how to solve the same problem, even at a high level, these people generally cant come up with an answer.This results in a lot of suboptimal code as the developer settles for \"it works\" because they dont know how good code should look like. Right now AI is decently good, but in my experience, the more you have to keep re-prompting for changes, the worse and worse it gets. So not having a clear direction for what something should look like before engaging AI can sometimes lead to horrible code as you don't know how to course correct because you dont even know what the course is.As a new junior developer, your work is probably very simple and things that AI can handle really really well. But as you progress in your career and tackle more complex issues that AI just isnt good enough at yet, you will need to have critical thinking and problem solving skills that I think you are not developing because you are so reliant on AI.This ended up being a bit of a soap box for me, but tldr: solve the problem on your own and use AI as a faster typing interface so you can develop your problem solving skills better.",

A little harmful to readability, but most compilers will disregard these anyway.One recent example I've seen, is enforcing \"code deletions and additions must have test coverage\" on a large legacy/enterprise codebase. Effectively, what this means is that you either need a lead to sign-off on an exception (pretty easy to get), or that when you change the legacy functions, you must add enough test coverage to \"prove\" that it works.Otherwise, the scanners because just another step to the compiler. Probably okay to add in the beginning stages of a project, but quite burdensome to carte blanche add after a few years.",

I’m only saying that because it sounds like you wouldn’t be able to work on off hours for on call work or deployments that would happen at night. I’m also guessing that you would require remote work? Those are the most competitive jobs on the market outside of AI companies. Additonally, sometimes requirements change closer to a deadline requiring significantly more work towards a release date. You have a hard restriction that would go against this. SWEtype work is salary for a reason, and that it’s because hours are not always the same week by week.Maybe you can find a smaller non profit/hostpital?",

It doesnt get you the job but it might get you in the door.\\- in your current job take as many roles as you can. I became scrum master of my team within a year and. i put that in my resume. Not sure if it did anything but it shows that i could \"lead meetings\". FAANG expects you to lead meetings, have difficult conversation, etc. \\- Understand what you are doing.

I have worked with consultants who were smart and have gone on to work for big tech so it depends on each individual career trajectory. But most end up being master of none as they move between projects. It takes years to develop expertise in any tech stack working on a specific problems, say develop a delivery app. Increase the $$$ to attract the right candidate and filter accordingly.",

Prob a company thing. Do you mean this is all that HR is letting through their filters? They need to give you/your team more agency, let more through that aren't from these outfits. They are probably applying binary keyword searches instead of understanding the job requirements and how to read a developer resume.

Unfortunately, consulting has a lot of people that faked it till they made it because the repercussions of not doing well for certain clients actually aren't that harsh. What happens is they place you with clients that are \"easier\" and can be satisfied by a consultant consistently missing deadlines or one that isn't acclimated to being on the bleeding edge of technology. Because of this there's a sorta schism in the talent pool for consulting. My advice is to really read into their resume and figure out if it's fluff (it usually is). During the first round, be sure to pay close attention to how they talk about previous work. This won't solve all of your problems, but I do hope it provides some clarity to the quality of candidates you get.",

Every economic crash siren is blaring at full volume from tech companies trying to hide how much they're spending on AI with creative accounting, vendor financing where Nvidia invests in Open AI who invests in Oracle who buys chips from Nvidia, increasing bankruptcies across all businesses, growing sub-prime auto loans this time, a whole bunch of private credit happening outside of the regulated bank environment... The future looks really bleak for the economy generally. 30+ years of basically \"endless\" growth propped up by a government printing money any time the market tried to correct itself. AI is scary sure, but I'm more scared of the AI bubble popping taking down the rest of the economy with it.Best thing you can do in your position is do the best with the information you have. If you truly love software, stay in it. That will show through. It'll be tough to get seen, but once you do your passion will stand out. First step is be employed, and from there just do your best to minimize debt and build an emergency fund. It would also be a great time to find someone you can tolerate to split expenses with.",

(Stating your opinion that things could be better is a form of criticism, and is unlikely to be well-received coming from a newcomer who isn't informed on the history or reasoning behind the thing they're judging.)It's kind of part of being a responsible person in general... Taking care of things that need to be taken care of without being asked to.In the professional setting you would need to use your judgement about what kind of things would be ok to do without first asking for approval and what kind of things you should clear with your manager before taking action on.
