        "body": "Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s. I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:First and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. **Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. Second, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. Third, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. IMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",

Im being serious this is a \"pub\" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.This industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. When I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.Compute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.With this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.It does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.Modelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.Id love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?Anyway... your not alone...Do you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive. So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.They *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity. And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason. But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult. So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.But that doesn't mean nobody is. It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff. While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions. This is not as much a concern now. \\- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design. 'Just get er done'....minimum viable product thinking which created tech debt that doesn't get addressed.

        "body": "As a DW professional with two decades in the domain, I’ve lived through the transition data modeling and data architecture have gone through during those times. When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!Nowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. I guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. I’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).Edit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",

And over engineer it if needed just to get used to the tools.And unless you're working at a large or mid size company with an established engineering team, I find data engineering is generally a catch all term. Like at meta you might be strictly building and optimizing pipelines but at a home office you'd be doing everything from traditional data engineering, to bi engineering to ml engineering.

You need experience as the end consumer of a data stack (or lack thereof), have some comfort with software engineering as opposed to simply \"knowing how to code\", and put in the work to learn how to build and maintain the plumbing that enables data to make its journey from source to business value. This last part takes years of work.The most common story I see (and mine is more or less the same): STEM major works as DS/DA/BI analytics/similar position. Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build. From this point you become a DE in a few months, by definition.I suggest you *don't* look for DE positions. Look for any other job as a data practitioner, and try to slowly move upstream on the data stack from there. It really does take years.",

You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an \"expert\". You also gain broader experience and it's a place where being a jack of all trades and self learner is greatly appreciated, which is kinda rare in UK companies.",

Also sign up for a free trial on Snowflake and mess around with it. Learn how you can get data in and query it.

And the latter is sometimes difficult because although every manager loves the idea of pay-per-use, they soon find out they actually have to pay for what they use, while in the old system they did not have that dynamic. Given the amount of overhead of running something yourself, I would definitely not rule out Snowflake. It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.What I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer. We are eying that currently, and I think we will save around 50% on our Snowflake bill.",

I'm a huge fan of it, even considering the hands on experience I have with alternatives.Cost wise, it really is pay for use. Basic common sense applies.Cost monitoring should be a priority. Dashboards that autorefresh frequently when they don't need to must be hunted down and shot.People who use SELECT * need reeducating again....and again. It is possible to block its use with a row policy but that can cause more problems than it is worth .One thing that shocks me with clients is that if they have budgetted X, with a bit of leeway, then they don't care if it costs significantly less.

        "body": "This is the wrong way to think about this.Snowflake is a consumption based pricing model. It's not really about the size of your data at all. It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.They give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.It scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.BUTthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \\*and\\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.It's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.So the math is simple:DIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (\"Free!\\*\\*\\*\") + a lot of opex (\"pay people to manage it\") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)PaaS/SaaS is higher capex (\"Snowflake is expensive!\") + very little opex (\"this thing runs itself\") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.So in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.When my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: \"When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.\"PS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price. Don't think of it as \"needlessly\" expensive - think of it as \"am I going to use it in a way to deliver the value I'm trying to pay for?\"",

BigQuery gives 10GB of storage and 1TiB of query data processed per month for free. Not just that, in BigQuery you can partition your data on various field and time, which optimizes your query processing to use less resources and manage costs. Big Query's Active storage costs $0.02 per GB which you will be charged around $20 each TB after 1 TB coz first 1TB each month is free. In snowflake it's around $40 and no free storage.And as long as Postgres is concerned, you can use a hybrid in which you can use it for smaller transactional data which you might not want to store for longer period, like logs, sessions, and sometimes historical data, you can use it for quick processing for your SaaS and use Data Warehouse for analytical use cases because as your data will grow Postgres will start to slow down in processing, but data warehouse will be great for processing big data, using this approach will significantly optimize your cost and boost your use case.",

One task that extracts, one that loads and one that transforms. Of course this is highly dependent and it helps to be pragmatic. In some instances you'll need to break these patterns. For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.For example:- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).Then on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).We'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",

Their day to day KPI and process jargon. You need to translate your insight into something they understand on *their* terms, not yours. Basically put yourself into their shoes and rewrite every slide deck you have to depending on the audience. You need to get used to the idea that these are different languages or dialects you have to learn to speak. There's no real short cut except practice and exposure. Know when you can afford to geek out and when you need to dumb down and what your goal is when you are presenting. When you've mastered that slide deck presentation, you can also apply that principle to your emails, learning to write differently when addressing the emails to different stakeholders to get what you want.",

We're encouraged to use these to understand different aspects of the company. When you understand what they do, how they're talking with their counterparts you get a better feel for what they need communicated. Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.- Talking with people directly, asking: \"hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?\"- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.Maybe \"Storytelling with data\" is helpful for some situations?- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. - Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.Generally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",

Orchestration: airflow or simply try CRON. Airflow is great but deploying can bring some difficulties. And use version 2.xx. Version 3 has been realised in this year and as I know need few updates to work correctly. I think it will be easier to start with version 2.xx.BI: Python Stremlit - very easy to build nice looking chartsVersion control: git of course, and github with github actions. And my recommendation for future is to buy computer for homelab and try proxmox to create different VM and set different services on each.On local computer is easier because everything works on localhost so you don't have to worried about networks.I suggest to use docker. It much easier and I guess you want to focus on data processing instead of devops thing.",

I am not a big graphdb person so I don't know, but have built semantic models the other way and had mixed results with AI.In the end though the challenge for me was more about semantics and synonyms than anything else. In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business. I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question. I could make it work if you ask it things in exactly the right way, but that's not the point of a conversational tool like an LLM.",

What you need to do is understand that trust is the important thing there is. It is your main job to build trust in your products. This is more important than anything else you do. It is FAR more important than your speed to delivery. You need to reframe your whole approach and prioritize building trust.

To me what sets candidates apart is to talk about where dbt can go wrong in a project and what are the best practices, alerts, and team education you can put in place to help manage dbt complexity.For example, people often complain about dbt’s spaghetti DAGs where model lineage is impossible to trace. I would ask a candidate 1) what is the software engineering concept not being followed that is causing this mess (my answer: lack of DRY models and not having one purpose per model) 2) How would you go about fixing this? (my answer: start with a model used for BI consumption, understand its source tables and columns, check column level lineage for each column, come up with a plan to consolidate intermediate models after understanding each column calculation) 3) How do you prevent this in the future? (My answer: create a strong culture of preplanning and peer review, alerting based on some measure of DAG messiness in the CI pipeline)Going from “I just know general dbt concepts and execute them” to “I can make your data ecosystem stronger with my dbt skills and promote of a culture of engineering excellence” will take you way further.",

The advanced ones are pricy and I don't have a company paying for me to take them. I haven't been asked about dbt/databricks yet. Even the positions that require a basic knowledge of these seem to require at least 3 years of experience with that. I've got over 20 in other data pipeline tools, but I've been too timid about applying to roles that require multiple years, or when I have inquired if experience is required / can I learn this tool on the job, I get passed over because there are hundreds of other candidates that do have experience with them. I'll download dbt core and start building something out there. I do like dbt cloud, but I did burn my free credits just learning it.",

When you are ready, you will know you are. Data Engineering is like getting a Ph.D in random intertwined data problem solving. It's not entry level, and it's certainly not something you can do with a class or two. Start with analytics, dashboards, learn where the pipelines go, and then start moving up. Once you understand the processes going on, find the next process in line. Keep doing this until you can look at data and understand the whole business use case and story behind the data you're looking at. This takes a long time.",

If you are planning to shift to DE externally after a year or so, I would recommend you position your CV in a way that is conveys you were more into the DE part of the job and less on the analyst. Data titles may be 1 Dimensional, but the roles we do within the organization are usually an intersection of Analyst/Science/ Engineer. So it boils down to how you word your experience in the resume when it comes to applying for jobs.",

For example the NFL starts next week, you could scrape fantasy football rankings from multiple sites and calculate each player's average rank (or some other analysis). Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).Then it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.Sports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time. This sort of thing is a common use case for a simple but non-trivial data pipeline.",

The worst offender I have seen is college basketball with 360+ teams and they (different APIs) ALL use different team names/abv/date formats and timezones. Or doubleheaders in baseball can be a beotch between systems as well, just to consolidate properly. Thats an excellent sample of real world messy data, and even then for the most part its \"clean\" as far as data entry goes, but the ids and matching can be a fucking nightmare, especially with more than 2 lol, matching 360 abbreviations between 3 sources is a nightmare, we have about 8 ncaab apis consumed lol, none of them overlap that well",

In terms of naming/partitioning, it’s going to depend on how you plan on referencing that data. Is the raw data layer the only place you’re going to store the data while using a data lake query engine for analytics? Will you transform read and write it to your next layer? If the former, you probably want to consider a meaningful partitioning strategy based on query patterns to help with predicate push down/partition pruning. If you’re going to move it to another system (like synapse) or file (parquet based file store) then id recommend using an ingestion time partition strategy.I usually like to do something like: source_name/object_name/ingestion_date=/.jsonAlso, bronze is usually synonymous with raw, but at the end of the day these terms are just trying to bucket specific concepts into language so nothing is perfect.",

My guess is spark looked at the code submitted and calculated that it's more efficient to run it with a smaller number of workers rather than scaling out (maybe because the data isnt huge so it's faster to do it all on one node?). Spark may be wrong about this since you're using gzip files so maybe try converting/saving to parquet first and then running your data processing on the parquet files and see what happens. Gzip typically takes more time to decompress so breaking the job into two parts (decompressing in part 1 and transforming data in part 2) could help triage the issue better. Do you see performance gains when using more nodes? UDFs typically aren't great for performance, what does the UDF do specifically? I've found the built in functions are pretty good at doing what you want if you're a little creative, plus they're going to be faster. Also if you're using >30 withColumn statements that could be slowing down performance a bit since i believe each one makes spark recalculate the logical plan, so you could try using withColumns instead.",

It supports both comma/semicolon/tab/etc separated files and files with fixed width columns.The plugin can automatically detect the columns and datatypes, and after that you can do several thing with the data. Like sort, select/rearrange columns, count unique values, validate the data etc. The data validation can check for technical errors, like text value too long, incorrect datetime/decimal formats, date out of range, missing quotes, incorrect coded values etc.",

Sit down with key business people and find the most important questions they want answering.Then, find what data sources you'll need to answer those questions. In the beginning, this is typically financial reporting / sales related. How much money are we making, etc.2. Focus on delivering these core information sets at first, before doing ANYTHING more fancy. Give the business the ability to answer their super basic, but essential questions.3. Data stack:Azure is fine, but i'd personally reccomend AWS or GCP.Similar with Databricks - it's fine and will work, but they specialise in data science, you're probably better off with BigQuery or Snowflake if the focus is analytics.I'd avoid PowerBI and use Tableau. Or, if you can afford it, Looker.Open source tooling is great. I'd highly reccomend dbt for the data transformation layer. And airflow for orchestration.Data ingestion, as you've mentioned, as a one person team. managed pipelines are a good place to start: airbyte, fivetran or stitch. Just be conscious of costs here as they can rack up, versus custom implementations (using lambdas, ECS etc).Feel free to dm me any questions!",

Let's say TBL A has 100m rows for same prim\\_key you are joining on, and TBL B has let's say 1000 rows for the same prim\\_key, now when you are doing joins, the result is 100m \\* 1000 rows in single core/executor. Now let's say you introduced a new key with salt factor of 100 for eg. You pick the smaller table and do cross join and create 1000 \\* 100 rows for TBL B, you add a new col in TBL A and 100m will be divided by 100 for each salt key resulting in 1m rows per each salt key. Now when you perform join, your executor is effectively processing still 1000 from B, 1m rows from TBL A --> final count per core / executor --> 1000 \\* 1m.You can do the math for two large tbls, the only consideration is the table which is going to have smaller rows should be choosen for cross join candidate, and your executor should have enough memory to handle this data skew in the first place. I'll let others pitchin for above two large tbl joins.",

Here is the short excerpt from it:If you just need to know whether your cron jobs or data scripts ran and succeeded (plus error details for debugging), PulseHook is way simpler and cloud-agnostic. It’s built for developers who want fast setup and easy alerts. AWS CloudWatch is much more powerful but focused on deep infrastructure/app monitoring for everything in AWS—great for big teams, but overkill if you just want lightweight job status alerts.

This way if the ETL didn't finish in time for automated analytics emails etc, then those emails will just send with the day-old data and models will wait until the next day (or manually refreshes when I check on it).",

Dagster is asset based so it might work for you, I’m still pretty new to it but I believe it should allow you to set dependencies so that if a specific table is refreshed all of the upstream data is also refreshed.Another way to solve situation 1 would be to create a YAML config file where you store a basic config for each data model and then add a field like depends_on or something.If you’re refreshing all of your models at once you can do a topological sort to sort through the dependencies. If a specific data model is being refreshed then recursively traverse through the depends_on field until each path ends, then sort them. You can also group data models together by a tag and filter to that tag.I’ve used this in other contexts, but never actually for managing data models, so you should consider the maintenance considerations and whether it would work within your context.",

I myself played in a band for a decade or so. You have a tall mountain to climb. My best advice is to treat SQL like a religion, set up some local persistent database file (duckdb) with a robust data set and learn how to write good SQL. Read kimball modeling practices and write SQL to make good data models. Get a job as an analyst. Get tight with the people feeding you the data and step into their world. Good luck",

If you are a hard worker and self learner, and you start out by building a project and find your you like it a lot then there is no reason you can’t succeed. All the info and more exists on the web for free. The best thing to do is to think of a personal problem you want to solve (my first project was a web scraper that found upcoming shows for artists I like in my area, I still maintain it 8 years later) — and make it fullish stack. Some backend DB, like Postgres, some python data wrangling, some analytical processes using duck db, and then a UI of some sort for fun like a UI to trigger jobs or view reports. I would suggest pasting the above snippet to chat gpt and asking for a real breakdown starter project template — but then refraining from asking it to do anymore. Use documentation or old school blogs to debug and learn throughout the process",

I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. Myself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. For a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. I learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",

Or can I just, lets say, write a json to represent the order and send it directly to the pipeline, keeping the production schema only with `customers` and `products` tables? Would that be too far from what actually happens in real scenarios? I'm afraid I may be oversimplifying things.I'm guessing that, in the \"real world\", an e-commerce needs to write the customer orders first in its production database to keep track of stuff similar to what I described in the last paragraph of my post. Should I take that into account for my project? If yes, for how long the data is kept in production?

For datastore, if you want the most flexible analytical layer, Snowflake or BigQuery are still the safer bets Redshift is convenient inside AWS, but less forgiving long term.On the consistency side: some teams solve this by using platforms that sync DynamoDB into relational stores in near real-time while handling conflicts automatically.

This is actually a recommended approach when you need to split data from a single collection into multiple destination tables.Here's how it works:1. First, you need to define logical partitions in your collection by specifying one or more fields as partition keys:```collections:  acmeCo/user-sessions:    schema: session.schema.yaml    key: [/user/id, /timestamp]    projections:      country:        location: /country        partition: true      device:        location: /agent/type        partition: true      network:        location: /agent/network        partition: true```2. Then, in your materialization, you can use partition selectors to direct specific partitions to different tables:```materializations:  acmeCo/example/database-views:    endpoint: ...    bindings:      - source:          name: acmeCo/anvil/orders          partitions:            include:              customer: [Coyote]        resource: { table: coyote_orders }```",

Much more memory efficient, and the API is much nicer to work with. Read the Polars user guide, but maybe start this part first: https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/migration/pandas/PS: Don't depend on external software, if possible.

Well, it depends ;-)Writing data to tempdb is a physical operation, which is costly if you do it for a lot of data. If you already have data in an indexed table that's optimized for your workload, it would be a poor decision to write it to a temp table.If you can subset a (relatively) small amount of data from your big, indexed table, and put it in a temp table, it may be worth it. Especially if what comes next is a long and complex query that would otherwise be hard for the optimizer to build a proper plan for, if it were to run on a big table.Generally, write operations are slow and resource-heavy. That includes writes to tempdb. You should avoid them, unless later performance gain outweight the cost of writing the data.",

I let the data analysts roam free in silver, they can create views, that can become new tables when the view is too slow.When they want / need performance because the data is too large to load in PowerBI, we build new silver tables or dim/fact tables as needed. Incremental process. I’ve seen too many projects fail because too much emphasis in Gold, they don’t need an entire kitchen if only kitchen sink is needed.

Which means you could easily have several candidate tables to compute Revenue for exemple. On the gold layer in contrary, everything is pre-cleaned, pre-aggregated, and non-ambiguous. There's literally a table named \"Revenue\" with a column \"Revenue\" and no other. So it's easy for business people to find the source of truth.As a data team, yes it's a pain to go in this kind of complexity.

You really just need to expose data for it to be self serve, and it need not be cleaned or layered at all. I think you’re actually arguing for scalability, but that’s still conditionally true. Regardless, I get the impression OP is arguing against the significance of layer naming. OP did mention how it depends on the limitations of your layers, which insinuates that OP understands the significance lies in how you use the layers—not what they’re named. How you ought to use the layers depends on what attributes you’ve assigned to them.You may argue that one pattern is more optimal than another, but what you’re arguing for here is the standards of governance applied to each tier in the hierarchy, not the names of each tier. And again, your pattern would be more or less optimal conditional to pretext that comes from even further upstream. For example, what if your limited data sources come in a manner that the business already regards as “clean?” Would you just copy the data redundantly through a 3-tier+ structure?",

I'm not sure what exactly *the* small files problem is or what *your* problem is in particular, but if you're looking to, say, keep only the latest values based on some key across multiple files, you have a few options.One option is as I described: compaction. Go across your files and grab only the most recent data you want/need, merge into a new file, discard the old ones. Whether you want to implement this and how kinda depends on your exact data needs, so it's hard to say. At the very latest, I'd do this before archiving any data.The other is to just track all changes in the data in your silver layer and grab the latest value. It's not really solving the small files problem though. Worst case scenario is just appending the files into a large file and keeping track of the file from which it came (or timestamp, whichever is more important).",

If you can try to sway them one of thode wats way (or simply bring in a MS/Databricks representative to do it for you).Make sure you know that DBT will not work in Synapse on `spark SQL`. You need to use the Microsoft SQL flavor, which differs quite a lot (it gets weird) & can get quite expensive. On Databricks (and I believe also Fabric) spark SQL does work.

Yeah, I've suggested it before in a prior thread and am happy to put the OP in touch, or anyone else in this predicament. And I have provided some known best practices things where our newer offerings don't support footguns that prior offerings had to keep supporting for compatibility (e.g. Entra Auth is more secure than SQL Auth, Fabric doesn't support SQL Auth as a result) to make it easier to migrate if they do have to go down that path. Fabric wasn't available in GCC yet last I checked, so depending on the country / government organization in question and the project, might not be an option yet. We're working on it. And yeah, Fabric Warehouse and SQL endpoint added Spatial support, which Synapse Dedicated etc did not have:https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/exploring-spatial-functionalities-in-fabric-data-warehouse?ft=All",

After a POC, if you decide the inbuilt orchestration of Synapse then moving to Airflow is reasonable although starting with Airflow is begging for this to be a much more arduous project than it needs to be. If you know 100% you are going to be using Airflow in the future then sure use Airflow.Spark pools will do this for you. I'd avoid data flow where possible and use native spark because data flows are quite literally double the cost of straight spark. People absolutely hate it on Reddit although I use notebooks as they can be instantly inserted into Synapse pipelines with the very string caveat that all spark code in notebooks within a pipeline has to be written as if it's regular code i.e. No bollocks.",

No WordPress, no backend, just HTML, CSS, and JS for some device queries, button actions and session storage for language preferences. The end result is a website that is more photo-heavy, has more features and runs faster and better in both desktop and mobile applications than the Wordpress websites our competitors use. I even did the SEO.I am now writing them a SaaS CRM system in Python. Mainly so I don't have to webadmin the page and do all the watermarking and resizing. They can just log in and upload the images and the enter the data into forms. And later I can add image and data export to aggregate sites and even APIs to connect to accounting software. Even if it works for one company only, I will still have learned a lot, not only about Python and Django but also about webhosting, setting up and running a server, Linux, Docker, automated testing, logging, security and backups. Might even end up setting up my own CI/CD pipeline for pushing updates. But it might also become and actual product, I could sell to other small and medium-sized real estate brokerages who cannot afford the subscription fees of the big CRMs, never mind developing their own custom solution.",

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.* Make debugging cheap. Seed data easily, add local tracing, keep a scratch REPL file, enable frontend debug toggles, dump full state with diffs, and add helpers to jump the UI into target states.* On a team, ask questions early. Do the five minute search first, then get unblocked fast.* Protect shipping cadence. Aim for quick deploys, low bug rates, fast cross-team handoffs, reusable patterns, and lean process. Cut the 10 percent of a feature that eats 50 percent of the time. * Treat slow shipping as a problem to root cause.* Learn to code review. a code review is an invitation for feedback and to get another pair of eyes on your work. To catch issues before it goes to QA.",

In my experience, finding client or server side code hard depends mostly on your familiarity with both the technologies being used, and the codebase. Once you become more familiar, they become less hard, whether frontend or backend. The complexity of backends can relate largerly to the distribution of services and their interaction with one another. This requires the ability to store a large, and complex mental model, which can be difficult. Frontends can contain complex physics based animations, or complex state interactions, which also involve having a clear mental model. Either one requires familiarity with the concepts and the codebase. If you are finding backend code harder to understanding, you'll get there. You just need to spend time reading the code, reading the docs, and learning about the technologies, and things will become clearer. Whenever I am learning new code, I imagine it like a foggy room where everything is hard to read, and over time the fog starts to disappear, and it gradually becomes clearer and clearer.

        "body": "It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:When someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their \"first\" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the \"21st\" century even though the year begins with \"20\" and not \"21\". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').In many buildings throughout the world, the \"1\" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's \"nice\" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is \"0\" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.(Side note: This \"number of floors offset from the ground\" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).Here is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a \"0\" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a \"1\" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.It might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \\* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the \"group index\" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.The above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \\[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.I'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",

That would be 0b00000000, 0b00000001, and 0b00000010. There's a natural progression there. I think it just made sense to the people making compilers for various programming languages to start with the first available byte value, which is all zeros, which comes out to a decimal zero. I also suspect this is related to the limitations of early systems. Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought \"Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.\" I think starting from the first available byte value, instead of skipping it, appeals to that tradition as much as it's just natural to do.",

Programming isn’t a justifiable reason to jump to Linux. Of course, Linux is better suited for a tech person, and a lot of programming tools come with better compatibility for Linux, but these specific examples are so few and far in between, and with WSL working well enough, hopping on to Linux isn’t a question of “can I program better in it”. Instead, it’s a question of having and maintaining a whole OS mostly on your own- which doesn’t have much to do with programming.",

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.It's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.Lastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up. If you dislike maths I'd have a good think about whether you dislike actually puzzling over it or whether your education system has constantly thrown you challenges beyond your comfort level and never given you the chance and support to address your weaker spots.Some actual learning advice / resources:On the maths front, Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud is my top pick for a zero to hero maths book if it's of interest as it really starts from the fundamentals.If you like Python, automate the boring stuff with python is a fantastic resource, available as a website, courses on Udemy, a book, whatever floats your boat.Outside of that, honestly just do some coding puzzles online. Codingbat, codingames, codewars and loads more. Leetcode is there too but is probably best left for later once you're feeling up to it.3 months to do some well directed self study is gold. Take it steady and I'm sure you'll see some real progress.",

Key is to stay consistent, build logic-> stay practical for good understanding, note- If u feel stuck, go online look for the code no problem but the thing is you have to ask why why did person use this instead of this.eg: we can print this\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* simply as print(\\*); but for easy and quick we row 5;for i in range(1, rows + 1):print(\"\\*\" \\* i)",

I went the opposite route and learned the programming first and then had to go back and learn all the theory (don’t recommend this route). I wouldn’t stress it tbh, and if you’re dead set on starting to learn a language then probably start with Python as it’ll be easier to at least read and comprehend while learning the basics. The nice thing about programming languages is once you understand programming and know a language well, picking up other ones is a lot less daunting and is generally just a matter of learning syntax and any language specific things (this varies by language). There plenty of free courses on YouTube through free code camp. But again I wouldn’t stress, they’re not going to expect you to be a coding genius stepping into class or there’d be no reason to even have a CS program.",

That's fine, because if you're a programmer you understand that the position you're in right now is exactly where a seasoned senior developer is, but from a different vantage point.

Also, another piece of advice, find a language and stick with it for awhile. When I first learned programming, I kept agonizing on which specific language to learn, but the reality is that really doesn't matter all that much. Most of the concepts you master in one language will translate to another.Oh and 17 is not late to start coding, I didn't start to learn how to code more than a tiny bit until I was in my late 20s. I'd say you're doing quite well :)Edit: One other thing to note. You might find in college you might grow to like math more btw. When I was in high school, I also hated math a lot. What I realized later on, was that a lot of that was how it was taught in my high school. A lot of my math classes in high school were just straight memorization of formulas and I despised every moment of it. Once I got to college though, I actually learned how to think mathematically, how those formulas are derived and proven, and learned that math is actually quite beautiful.

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The OS is not **written** in binary code. But because it is **compiled** to binary code, which the CPU directly understands, there doesn't need to be any other layer \"underneath\" it.The compiler, too, can be written in a high-level language which is compiled to machine code.> Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer? Yes, this is basically it. You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.For instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.Then you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.Once you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [\"self-hosting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).But remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were \"bootstrapped\" over the last 70 years or so. Once you have a self-hosting compiler, you no longer need all of the previous layers of bootstrapping.",

        "body": "Higher level languages get converted into machine code. Everything gets converted to machine code whether it's an OS or not. It's what the CPU understands, by definition.Generally the process goes something like this:1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.Introductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is \"compiled\" or \"interpreted\" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's \"interpreted\" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.A lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about \"free-standing\" versus \"hosted\" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.But the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be \"undefined\" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.Also you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the \"OS\" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it. IIRC Android 13 was the first version to be less than 50% C and C++. (Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)The point is it's all machine code in the end. The only question is if the language is accustomed to letting you do practically everything the machine code will allow, or whether you would be fighting the language's built-in assumptions to implement the OS's most basic functionality for yourself.",

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.In this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.When you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says \"run the machine code at this address.\" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.The operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.Even the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask \"well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?\" and that would be a great question. The answer is a system called \"bootstrapping\" in which, yes, somebody had to actually write out some machine code by hand at the very start of all this.",

But people don’t actually write in it because it’s impossible to read and understand. Assembly is a human readable, near one-to-one translation of binary which gives programmers direct control over every bit of data and where it goes. It’s not the same as a programming language, because you’re not programming instructions, but manipulating data. Compiled programming languages like C, C++, and Java take a different approach, where instead of directly manipulating the data programmers are given access to more abstracted tools, like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and nodes. Complied languages like C still give you more control over the hardware then interpreted languages like Python, but there’s still more abstraction then you’d find in Assembly. But in the end, it’s all complied down into machine code. For clarity, compiled languages are not a step above Assembly in the sense that complied languages are complied into Assembly which is then complied into Machine Code. They’re two different branches of programming with different levels of abstraction, but both lead back to the same root. Now compilers are generally written through a technique known as bootstrapping, where the first version of a compiler is written in one language, and then the second version is rewritten in the language it’s meant to compile.For example, the first C compiler was written in Assembly, but all subsequent versions were written in C. So version x of a programing language is compiled on version x.1 of its compiler.",

The C code will get complied down into machine code and run fine.That's broadly correct.One of the nice parts about C is that the language grammar is completely divorced from the standard library. This is not true for C++, but it's not that difficult to replace the portions of the language grammar that are linked to to the standard library (eg, the *new* keyword).It is entirely possible to implement some of the C standard library functions in format that is suitable for use in kernel space. For example, most kernels will have memory allocators similar to malloc (Linux has kmalloc()) and print to a kernel console.>But if OSes don't need to be written in Assembly or even binary, what does? Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The C programming language was designed to allow the Unix operating system to be easily ported to many different machine architectures. Unix Version 7 was the first version of Unix that was easily portable. It was ported from PDP-11 to Motorola 68K, x86, VAX, and more. Approximately 98% of the operating system kernel was written in C, the remaining 2% was platform specific assembly. One of the nice parts about C is that it easily integrates with assembly.>Are compilers written in machine code?Sometimes, but not always.C is an evolution of B. B is a stripped down and modified version of BCPL.The first C compiler was written in B. Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.The first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS? Some fundamental code on the processor itself?Processor microcode. That's a different beast all to itself that programmers rarely ever need to worry about.BIOS is just a name for the startup routine and machine interface used by IBM PCs. It's usually specific to a particular motherboard and has the ultimate objective of finding and loading an operating system bootloader. BIOS has been depreciated in favor of UEFI. All modern operating systems generally shutdown firmware services and make little use of them, preferring their own drivers instead.>Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer?C code that is compiled as a part of an operating system kernel and C code that is compiled as a part of a userspace application are no different. instructions are instructions.",

        "body": "A couple notes about system calls and machine code since self hosting compilers were already explained.OSes don’t use system calls because they are the subject of system calls. They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you’re doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.On machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it’s a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It’s more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It’s the only thing the cpu actually understands.Also, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there’s a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you’re using is the standard “gcc -o2 [whatever]” that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you’d like to see it, you can. Btw, I know this because I had a friend who told me that if I really wanted to learn Linux I’d do this. He was wrong about that.",

But you did know what a URL, HTTP, and fetch in this context means to your program. Now you sought out how to actually perform it, and in the future you can recall this instead of searching again. It might take a few reps before it becomes muscle memory.You can't magically obtain all the knowledge without searching for it. Even during the days of Assembly there were instruction books. Similarly for C there is the C Programming book. A valuable part of SWE is being able to go forward with what you know until you reach a point of unknown, do research, and then return.Use Google, use LLMs (avoid copy paste and over reliance here), use the official docs, use books, use everything at your disposal to fill in these gaps.If it helps you, how I program is to write down comments before I write code. I will then look at what I can do versus can't do, and then fill in the gaps as I go.",

We all looked it up the first time. In fact, most devs (even seniors) still Google syntax or check Stack Overflow or use ChatGPT. That’s not a sign of weakness, it’s a sign you’re working smart.So what are you lacking?You’re not lacking intelligence or ability, you're just missing exposure and practice with real-world problems, that’s it.Before, you didn't know what to google, now you do, and that’s growth.How to get better:Build small projects from scratch, even if you use AI or Google to help.A web scraperA to-do appA CLI tool that renames filesAfter you finish a project, try re-building it without the tutorial or chatGPT, just from your understanding. That’s where the real learning kicks in.Read code, look at open-source projects on GitHub and try to understand how other people structure and write their code.Write code every day, even if it’s 30 minutes as Momentum beats motivation.Accept that discomfort is normal, feeling lost is part of the process, every dev has gone through this.And no, you’re not useless because you used GPT, you’re resourceful! The goal isn’t to memorize everything, it’s to solve problems, and you did that... that’s being a developer!Stick with it, you’ve already come this far, this is just the next step in the journey.You can absolutely improve with effort, just keep showing up, you’ve definitely got this!",

Yes, it's cumbersome and annoying, but it pays off.Most importantly: Code. No matter what. If you ain't got nothing else write a hello world program. Change the code, experiment with it. Yes, I read that you're a CSE grad, but you need the experience and especially the feeling and confidence that comes with it.And then learn to read documentation and references instead of googling. Your code looks like Python. So go ahead and read through the whole Python reference. You don't need to memorize it, and you can skip through stuff, but make sure you read all the function names and at least a little bit of what they do, and it will help you a lot to get some confidence and a starting point if you're looking for something. After that, pick some \"most used libraries\" (feel free to google it) and read a few examples for each, or the reference docs if you can afford to.There's no easy way, you have to go ahead and invest the time and brain cells. Again, it's not about memorizing everything, but having read stuff at least once will give you a better feeling for a language, what to find where, where to start, and some confidence.Good luck, I think the thing you're most lacking right now is confidence, and there ain't no better way to establish that than knowing that you worked hard.",

The difference is just what you need it for. The biggest thing you need to get comfortable doing is breaking things down into smaller steps. Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of. The trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up \"JS how to add 3 + 5\", look up \"JS how to add two numbers.\" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs? You'll always have to look those up. Not because you won't understand them, but because the specifics are always unique to whatever you're doing.",

They are really not that helpful at the stage I am at. Normally I go through the following, roughly in order: 1. Libraries. Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. 2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and \"first steps\", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. 3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later. Another important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. And the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need. There will never be a stage where you know all of this by heart, the best thing you can do is make sure you keep access to it, even without the internet, and you should know where the information you need is located.",

Now my project is way beyond that initial tutorial, but it helped to see what that person did to implement the things I wanted to do also.\\- With new things like MCP, Agentic AI, those I google a lot more because AI tends to not get those right and reading the docs is a better way I find. Or with obscure things, I need to google because there are no tutorials.In that sense, my first instinct is to sit down and think about what I'm doing, current skill level, how I learn things best, and go from there.",

[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) is also a great starting point. 0.1. All areas are hiring, but they’re all receiving extremely high number of applicants. It’s a “pick your poison” type of thing. I’d advise staying clear of any niche areas like AI/ML/Computer Vision/Cybersecurity/Data Science/etc. These will require either advanced degrees, or way more *relevant* years of experience than it would take you to go back for an advanced degree.1. Don’t count on finding a remote opportunity right out of the gate. These exist, even for junior role, but you might be sitting on the bench indefinitely if these are the only roles you’re applying to.2. Building on the previous point, apply to in-office roles, hybrid roles, local roles, those that may need relocation, and those that aren’t “programming” jobs but are relevant enough to let you make a transition into a “programming” job. Who cares if you don’t have the money to relocate or if your local job market pays peanuts, experience is more important than money for your early career, as long as you have a signed offer, make whatever financial decisions you have to do to make it work.3. If you have a legit disability preventing you from working in-office, then I don’t have any advice, I’m unfamiliar with that process4. Get a CS degree, if you already have a bachelor’s in something else, get a post bacc or preferably a Master’s.",

It's impractical for learning things IMO.I like videos to either ELI5 something I don't know but I want to try to understand without making that a real learning subject (like video from electroboom, or veritasium). But that's more entertainment. I'm not really learning. Or to be very specific in a domain I already know very well (so I can accept the pace of the video and still have critical thinking).Learning is doing. And watching a video while doing it is impractical because: you should look at one thing at a time and you should define the rhythm of your learning. Unfortunately, videos are imposing their rhythm. Using a text doc allows you to scan fast the content and move around the doc. Focusing on your code, switching when you need. Finding the right information and avoiding the sugar coating that takes ages of your time.When learning coding, you should be doing things. Not watching someone else do something. The solution presented always looks logical. And you feel you learnt something. But you actually just jump over a whole lot of questions in your brain that you don't even know you need to answer. Doing is the way to uncover those questions and fill the gap in your brain. Practice, find doc about what you are practicing, use videos only when you can't find another source that is text.You don't learn to run by watching video of Olympic runners.",

Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.In 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.I'd add:\\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",

Yes, controlling your side effects are important, but unless you're working in a functional language, things like printing and logging can be ignored 99% of the time, and the better visibility you gain into how your code functions is well worth it. If you're working in object oriented, sometimes you need a void method that operates via side effects, and that's okay. Not everything makes sense to have an output.

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.Sure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc. For example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.For example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different. In async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity. Limiting stuff like this requires a bit more thought when creating the system, but saves a lot of time on maintaining, debugging, and refactoring later.",

Also, half the point of OOP is that systems are dynamic, so having all inputs passed as parameters might be shooting oneself in the foot. I would slightly amend that to say “minimal global parameters.” Otherwise I agree, though. I like being able to match what goes in with what goes out, not having to guess which method or global parameter caused an exception because, idk, wrong type or something. I used to get so frustrated as a beginner with divide by zero exceptions and be like HOW??? WHERE? It would often be something external, and cleaning up doesn’t hurt anything. But you also sacrifice functionality. I just don’t like documentation/commenting, but you can solve a lot of problems like nan exceptions when comments draw your attention to the workflow. I honestly (besides commenting) don’t understand why I don’t have more exceptions than I do other than just building some good habits over time.Absolutely agree on unnecessary side effects. I do keep a lot of stdout printing at first so I can focus attention on the flow, but if it works, it works, and I delete all that stuff. You need it for debugging. IDE’s catch exceptions. But just because something doesn’t return an error doesn’t mean it does what you want it to do. But if it works, it works, and you don’t need a lot of side effects beyond that.Overall, this is a great list! I’m gonna copy this and keep it handy.",

It all depends on whether you do OO programming. If so, you might make each object have a single purpose and each method in the object be rather simple, but the interaction of all the objects might be complex.As far as side effects, well, sometimes you can't help it. You want logging, don't you? This approach to writing functions is more from a functional programming language view where functions should be side-effect free, but honestly, it's a pain to accomplish that.You can strive for it, but many don't seem to care about side effects. The ones you hear more are avoiding the use of global variables (passing stuff through parameters).It would be nice if certain languages could return tuples instead of single values.

Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique.

Your priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.Also, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.So, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.My advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.You can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.There's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.For example, I encountered something similar to the following: code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30Let's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.It would read better as boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) { return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 || taxCode == 30; }Even if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.The other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.If you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.There are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",

You're a lot more likely in that case to want small scripts to pull data from different sources and present it to you in a more usable fashion, or maybe do your own calculations, things like that, I'm guessing? Or do you mean you want to write software for the finance industry? Java isn't glamorous but it's widely used. There's not really a roadmap of languages to learn though.

It's not exactly the same as making the thing yourself from scratch, but there's a lot less guidance and you have to figure a lot of stuff on your own.I'm trying not to glaze the site too much so ppl wouldn't call me a shill, but it gave me a lot more confidence in my real world coding abilities, plus a bunch of github green squares and a project that looks impressive on the resume",

Personally, I would start by knowing those 335 repositories as they are the top ones. In addition, if I am stuck using a particular programming language, I would know the top GitHub repositories for that programming language. For example, if I am stuck with C++, I would do \"Written in this language: C++\" and then \"Repositories options: With this many stars: >10000\". That yields 241 repositories. Personally, if I were working on a C++ project, I would know those 241 repositories as they are the top C++ ones. In addition, the Apache Foundation projects are big, especially in the Java world.

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don’t waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?I don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.My advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.For another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.Usually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.Just as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

        "body": "These are great questions to be pondering, and your observations are good.1. Generally, substitution model vs machine model. If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.Edit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

They just need to specify those fields and will get a predictable response.If your function additionally relies on implicit, mutable state, e.g. certain fields being a certain value at certain times that can be updated by anything anywhere, including randomly or by the mere passage of time, then it's way more difficult to use the function correctly because you don't control the inputs directly.No one's saying \"never have state\".

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.Statefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.OOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.Statelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.At least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

        "body": "2 first: Objects are *data and their operations*. State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.1 and 3: Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.Let us back up a little: Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data. At all scales, this is what a program is. From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output. The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part. This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected: Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.This is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance. They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.Now, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches. This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example: In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*. If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).It is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.Some programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state. With a resulting large amount of bugs. It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).The graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs. Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all. But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way. It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.That minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.So, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program. OOP is by definition state and operations.BUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully. And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.Ed: I forgot to address the side-effects problem. State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state. That's the entire point of functions on persistent state. Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

One piece of code might set an indicator for a notification. This is a duplication of the information held in the code for the notification system. It’s very easy to forget that you need to update both states whenever you make a change to the code.

If you're so passionate about software you can't imagine doing anything else, got get a 4 year CS degree, an internship, push hard and I'm sure you'll be successful. But if it is the potential of better pay and work from home...well, better pay only happens if you can actually get a job, which is hard right now, and remote work is becoming more of a rarity again.",

There is mostly \"better\" or \"worse\", where \"worse\" is still far better than nothing.If you just worry about \"wrong\", you won't get very far. Be curious. Experiment. Try things. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how you could optimize it, once you've got it working and if you see that there is room for optimization.A good approach is that whenever you learn some major subjects (e.g. arrays -> lists -> dictionaries/maps) you revisit your old code and see if you could use any of the new found knowledge there.

That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.Now why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots of copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.But there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).And you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo that input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.And even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing. No copy and paste, no shortcuts.Using that process you will be learning to write code and learning to read code. Add to that reading a good book on your programming language and you'll be well on your way to becoming a good programmer.",

I rarely go below 200.Jokes aside: I do keep a document on my pc that is called \"what-i-dont-understand.txt\", which is a giant list of interesting stuff I found online with references. The things I swear will read later - and mostly also do, albeit with latency measured in years.For actual working I've come to organise my tabs into discrete windows. One per project (and I happen to split my professional time between them), and in that window only stuff relevant to that project is allowed.But most importantly - nothing of that has anything to do with VsCode yelling about 200 errors. 200 errors means you're not coding, you're throwing shit blindly without even knowing where the wall is to stick things to. You _need_ to get into the habit of producing small increments that compile, committing them to git, and then iterating from there. Code that doesn't compile might as well be bird droppings. And if copilot and cursor can't even produce compiling code - then throw them out too.And in addition to that: disable notifications and pings and the other commenter said.",

If you are high up enough in the project (as in someone people depend on) then arrange specific windows (2 hours in the morning, 2 hours end of day, for instance) that you are available for questions. the rest of the time only switch it on when you have questions to other people. Take time to read documentation. Like literally block a few hours and do the reading. It's work just like typing code is work. Close your AI tabs. Writing code, especially code that you know the structure of, is a restful activity that lets your mind go through the project. letting something generate your code makes it harder to know what is going on in the project and it pushes you into constant \"debug someone elses mess\" territory. ownership of code starts with having written it. And since it takes time, this time you can spend on thinking how you would like to fit this into the project.Also don't feel bad about starting code over after having tried something out. I keep separate browser windows open, each with their own tabs. one window has all my testing work (pages where I try out the application, pages where I have data I need to enter like test creditcards and the like, or the jira issue I am currently working on. (open in new tab is essential when you use jira, the new interface is a laggy POS))And focus on the one task. If someone comes to you with an extra problem / a new problem: that is unfortunate for them that they have this problem. It is however, not your problem. Don't context switch until you are finished with what you are working on. If something is important enough to drop everything then it is simply a matter for the person interrupting you to talk to your manager __and__ the person whose ticket you are working on. They can arrange with them that you drop their task. Often this is enough of a roadblock that they are willing to wait. I've picked this one up from another ADHD colleague who was really good at this.",

Research on your own and start somewhere. For your level and usecase it should be something cheap/free without the possibility of draining your life savings if you make a mistake. Look into a VPS and docker \\- Scaling? A lot of the things in the cloud these days autoscale in their own ways. But don't worry about this at all atm. You won't build anything that needs serious scaling for a long time probably. \\- Security? This one is kinda the odd one out. Security is a CORE part of any app, not just an afterthought. Another reason why you are not \"fairly proficient\". This needs to be understood and studied on a core level. \\- Architecture? This can mean anything \\- How to choose a tech stack?

You start with something small and manageable. You can then incrementally add to that. So for example you build a simple application, then host it, extend it to use authentication and integrate with something like google. Add something like accessing a database and learn how to deploy the database. This is just an example of how to build out what started as a simple application.The first time you do something, it may not be the best, but you will learn. The next time you can try changing things to compare until you find a method that works for you. There is no magic formula; there are good practices and standards which you will pick up as you explore, but ultimately, you need to develop what works for you.",

The cool thing about the tech field is that if you find yourself asking \"surely there's a better way to do this?\", the answer is yes 99.95% of the time. Stumbling into friction, problems, and headaches makes it incredibly easy to ask more specific questions and search for a deeper understanding, as opposed to just following a guide. A great way to write programs is to solve problems you run into.For instance, I work at a printer dealership. The software we use for tracking service tickets is 26 years old, takes several minutes to boot up, is insanely expensive, and is unintuitive and generally clunky. Maybe I'm audacious, but I became convinced I could do better. So now I'm writing a tool that does it better. It's been months and I'm nowhere near done, because I keep learning and refactoring and learning and refactoring... which is how I hit my stride. I write something, I go \"man, this sucks. maybe there's an easier way...\" and then I find an easier way. That's how you learn.Only exception here is security.

You can incorporate these into the next little push you make.I keep a TODO file in the root with every crazy thought I have as I work, roughly split by difficulty and area.

The first is to write a test harness that, once it passes, then you know the task is done.Like today I was stuck trying to build this new user story and ended up just making a really long cypress test that setup the environment to where the feature was relevant and walked through all the necessary steps. It failed (of course) but it failed quickly and showed the exact spot where it was failing so I could keep changing something, run the test, change something, run the test until it could run all the way through.I think that solves one cause of this which is constantly trying to remember how to get to the spot where the thing you’re working on pops up.Another cause is when I have to make something that involves several layers of abstraction. For that I like starting on one end and just sprinkling assert statements with detailed messages as I go. That way I don’t end up with a spaghetti mess of code that I’m trying to fix across several files.Hope that helps :)",

        "body": "Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one). The best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project. The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit. Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound. We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else. The key is the input. What a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground). This is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code). The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***. A library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox. It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks. A good example of this in JS is JQuery. They are typically very specific uses and very tiny. You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine. SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer. A game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic. Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware. In general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them. They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic. Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer. You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)Frameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end \"the angular way\" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",

I don’t know, but you and your students probably do.Then, with your students, meet the unmet need.

When they are working on a modern, interesting project, they mostly use nail guns and framing screws for finish work.They have a hammer as a back up, but it never really gets touched, because it’s widely accepted that it is no longer an efficient or thoughtful use of time and energy.So my thought has always been to not be afraid to scrap projects or leave them behind for the time being. Just, keep your tools, and do whatever you can to keep them intact. Cheers.",

You've failed tons of things before. You'll fail tons of things in the future. Some of them you'll fail multiple times.Life is about learning, picking yourself up, learning, and moving on with the experience you learned. If you dont feel you learned anything, you're being hard on yourself.Once you've got a can-do attitude. Work out your goal, and break it into steps.E.g.I need to show a 3d relationship graph between nodes.This is hugely daunting for someone new.What's step one?I need to read the file with my data.Okay, ill google how to read the fileThen ill try to show one of the numbers from the fileThen ill try to show one of the numbers from the file in a graphics windowThen ill try to show a few numbers and maybe a line",

C++ is a really difficult language compared to Python. It's interesting how fears demotivate some people. Why are you scared? I know it can be difficult to convince yourself otherwise. You probably have some pride. You *should* be able to figure this out. It *should * be quicker. And when it isn't, you feel bad.Maybe tell yourself, I may be dumb, but I'll work hard and figure it out in my own good time. I won't worry what others (or what *I* think others) think of me.

However, you're just stuck when you try to write a program on your own. It means you lack practice so can't advance because you can't get started to begin with.Alright, try this...First step: exercises.1. Go to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)2. Pick the language of your choice3. Finish all exercises. At least try to make 75% progress. By the time you hit that, you should have built some mild muscle memory as well as some creativity and rigor. Believe me you're gonna need all that when you tackle the second step.Second step: \"build your own X\"The FREE way:1. Go to [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)2. Pick an interesting stuff to build (e.g. Emulator > C > \"Writing a game boy emulator\")3. Follow and complete the introductory tutorial and try to expand with more featuresThe paid way:1. Create an account on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)2. Pick a challenge (e.g. \"Build an interpreter from scratch\")3. Pick a language (e.g. C)4. Follow the instructionsIt's 30$ per month though, so you gotta be committed asf and make the most of it: don't just blindly complete the challenges or worse: slack off. Read docs, engage in the community, get your project reviewed by someone, make sure you thoroughly understand the tool you just built (beyond the source code that you write).Third step: personal projectsSurely there are plenty of things you want to do... If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.After all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love. Maybe during your learning journey, you spotted a nice game engine project and you want to participate in its development. The entire world is yours to discover at this point!",

You can do all the exercises correctly and gradually as you need, it will definitely help you in the spot, but there's a huge gap between physical ability and ability to apply it right when needed. Even if we take a sport where you don't face the opponent directly, there is still a lot to learn besides building strength.I don't think people gradually grow from solving puzzles into building projects. It is a different mindset. It isn't a rocket science either. If OP google: \"how to learn building projects\", there will be many ways to handle it. Problems is that people were told that writing code will build that skill automatically.",

For most devs, DSA stuff is really just for interviews a way to weed out people that don't know how to code and expose some other traits like how you handle problems. For prestigious companies, it's the same, only more competitive so you need to practice to give better answers than your competitors.

The token douchebag classmate is not a credible outlet.

And you gotta trust me on this one. Whatever you do, find a leader you trust to talk to.Then you can add in some sort of counseling or vent-based release protocol for handling the *feeling of not feeling worthy or competent* because that is a whole different introspective beast.If and when you do have this talk, compartmentalize. Minimize the “I feel” statements. Focus on objective problems that you are having.I’m sure you’re aware of most of this, but take it from someone who has struggled immensely at multiple levels and has had substantial technical and research success in spite of that.Talk to your people. And when you’re done, make changes, and talk again.Cheers",

It sounds like the course you're doing focuses on giving you solid fundamentals(although it is a bit weird that git/version control isn't a part of that), and you're supposed to build upon those fundamentals yourself. Realistically, just following a course and not doing any extra curricular learning yourself isn't good enough nowadays, if you want to get hired.The good news is that you can change this. Ask yourself why you do programming? Is there a particular field you're drawn to? A passion you want to cultivate? Then prove it to yourself by actually studying and creating projects in that area in your spare time.If you're not sure what you're passionate about, then at least try something and see what sticks.As a personal example I never thought I would be interested in learning the really low level stuff until I came across a certain resource and then I just fell down a rabbit hole and allowed it to consume me.Good luck",

        "body": "Current CS major here who is still learning and finding cool resources outside of school:Looks like your programming skills are not a problem just a lack of familiarity with common tools. That is okay but you just need to play catch up. I suggest watching videos or following tutorials and actually practice using these tools like Git, Git Hub, Docker, etc as you mentioned but with a guide so you do not get lost. These seem hard but once you use them for a bit it gets easier. Even I struggle to understand new topics and tools but you got to push through and enjoy the grind.Resources:1. After reading your post I feel this is the best resource as per the gaps in knowledge you state you want to fill. It looks like you want to get familiar with command line interfaces(CLI), Git and Git Hub(which are different things), and how node.js and Java Script programs work. I **highly recommend** [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) course(free/asynchronous) to get familiar with all these tools(Git, Git Hub, Java Script, node.js, HTML, CSS, not docker though). It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings. 1. I was also confused about Git and Git Hub less than a year ago but using The Odin Project made me understand it a lot better and why it is so useful. BTW heres an extra resource to practice Git commands after you get familiar with using it: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en\\_US](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)2. You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills. It is also free and asynchronous but it has less focus on tools and more on thinking and problem solving which will only help you. They are lecture style with additional shorter videos and problem sets to solve.3. I see you also are a bit interested in game dev, if so follow tutorials for games on the Godot engine or even Unity or Game Maker. Anything really and do not feel bad about doing so especially if you have never used it. Of course do not just copy and paste from the video and try to take make it your own. Brackey's could be a good start but there are other great You Tube videos for game dev.I am not an expert but I would say you do not have to know everything but you have to get familiar with general tools. Of course when you get put into a project or land a job you may have to learn a new tool but if you get a sense of the generally popular tools needed for a specific project that will help you adapt.All in all do no give up just keep going, acknowledge your lack of experience but build upon what you know and do not know.",

An LLM is basically your own personal stackoverflow that responds instantly and won't call you names no matter how stupid your questions are. You can probably even ask it to generate you exercises appropriate for your level and grade them. They are also good at debugging (especially cryptic errors) and solving technical issues. You can't really rely on college to teach you those fundamentals, since a lot of courses are kinda awful even when you aren't cheating through them. Back when I was in college, most people who didn't start learning programming before college struggled.

Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.This is what you do every morning when you plan out your day. If you have a meeting at 10:00, and it takes you 20 minutes to get there, you need to leave at 9:40. But if you have to stop by the post office on the way, and it will take 5 minutes you need to include that in your time. But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.So, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don’t go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.Have other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.It may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.It is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.Decompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there. Start at the top and keep breaking things down until you can solve the immediate problem, then work back up to the big problem.",

Just like many small rivers form an ocean, many small solutions build the whole system.For me, programming has become a true passion. Logic isn’t something you’re born with—it’s something you develop over time through practice. After 30 years, I can hold hundreds of thousands of lines of code in my head.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.At the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.I examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing, select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base. Everything was coded in Fortran, however I was coding in other platforms and languages as needed.",

The bigger picture is developing the skill of coding. You can develop that skill with any framework. Once you're good at coding (which takes years), you'll be able to learn a new framework quickly.So stop worrying about picking the wrong one. In fact, all of the time you're worrying is time you're not building the skill, which is the only important part.I don't think there's ever a single thing I've regretted learning. I wouldn't worry that you're wasting time by learning the wrong thing. There is no wrong thing if you're learning and writing code.Here's the only recipe you need: (1) think of something you want to build, then (2) figure out everything you'd need to learn to build that, and then (3) learn those things. Then keep doing that until the things you're building are the kinds of things employers want.Much, much later, when your skills are good and you can build things successfully, you can start looking for what specific things employers are asking for and filling in gaps. But that comes later.",

So, some people may seem as they are progressing faster and all that but usually its just a pay-off for earlier work they have put in. Whether it was conscious or not.I have also struggled with comparing too much against others and not focusing on how much I have actually improved compared to the past me. Looking at other people for inspiration is always good, but can also be tricky mentally since you can feel worse about your skill etc.",

I still get that imposter syndrome sometimes. Anyway- becoming \"Senior\" takes years and no amount of tutorials will get you there. It's about building, shipping, maintaining. Experiences that only come with time. In many ways it is more about learning \"what not to do\" than what \"to do.\"I also tell my team that being a Senior Engineer is more about the \"business\" of software development than it is about just writing code.Having a mentor is key too so hit me up if you're interested.

Speaking from personal experience, I think it’s easy to over prepare. To keep knocking out frameworks, courses, whatever, without ever getting the confidence to dive in and start building. You probably have the requisite knowledge, training, and ability to go off-piste and stop just checking boxes to check them. I’m not saying don’t learn React or whatever thoroughly if it is applicable, but I am saying you are at the point where you may have more success if you start deciding for yourself what is applicable and what isn’t. And, no, it’s not supposed to feel easy and most people don’t feel confident at first :)",

In this way, it is its own documentation; whenever you're unsure how your system would behave for a given set of inputs, your unit tests should clue you in, either through static analysis or by failing/succeeding.As you point out, having tests gives you a level of security knowing that new changes don't introduce unexpected behaviors.What you say with regards to losing your \"feel\" for the code, that can happen and arguably is a \"feature\" of having excellent test coverage and architecture. If you're soloing a project by yourself, you might not see the immediate benefit. But if you work on an incredibly complex code base with multiple contributors, it's actually a great thing for you not to just rely on your feel. In the \"real world\", imagine you're pulled off a project and someone else takes your place. This person will have no \"feel\" and will rely on test coverage to ensure they're not breaking anything.And finally, from my experience, relying on tests hasn't necessarily diminished my feel for the code. I still know what it does and where it does it, but I have the extra validation that I have the test coverage needed to make changes.",

That's the only sort of extension / tool that I can think of but those won't necessarily point out things like tight coupling. I think some of them point out large numbers of imports, but for things like sonar, they just have limits on them like \"no more than x imports\". I don't know of a tool that will actively fix them for you though. Some of these scanners have code duplication detection as well, that might be a good indicator of where you can combine things or reorganize.EDIT: after some quick googling, Ndepend and DGML apparently are good tools for scanning.\\>Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thingNot sure I know what you mean here without an example. My initial thought is you could have some base class which does all the common stuff and implement it differently with the variations.

Having the path and following it are two completely different things.Also, being around computers is something most people do now. Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming. To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.What's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.So, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?I'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)You could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).Then, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).CS50w covers some backend stuff.You could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.Of course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build. But that's kind of a big \"if\" (to find a project you'll be interested in that isn't impossibly difficult).Anyway, good luck. You'll have to sift through a lot of advice and decide what to do.",

Freelancing and entrepreneurial efforts are, I believe, the best route for new developers in 2025. It's a slightly different path than the old Node and React route. Those are good tools, but they're better for teams than solo developers. I recommend using The Odin Project, especially if your interest is primarily in back end development. Try their Ruby on Rails path. Rails has been in decline for several years, but it's still a viable platform for solo development, and, more importantly, it will teach you how the back end works. Routing, models, controllers, services, ORMs,.etc. That should serve as a solid foundation for you going forward. Python and Django, for example, will make a lot more sense if you have a Rails background. So will many opinionated frameworks. But you're going to hear a lot of opinions based on your question.

Then I go back and read more carefully (doing exercises, exploring different options, breaking things, trying different solutions). I also keep a \"dev-diary\" of things that have been of interest during the day (or small notes of things that I may need the next day, as a reminder, really useful on Monday mornings, specially usefull when working with multiple projects).",

To a lot of us, the \"everyone else knows more and are better than me, how can I hope to keep up\" is just something our brain does that feels real but isn't, just like visual illusions and lots of other mistakes brains make. The feeling might even be mutual!1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests \"ordinary\" programming. Similarly, I find some languages like JS very hard to reason about because they're so … sloppy, and prefer rather strict languages; but there are plenty of people with the exact opposite preference. Finding out what _your_ preference is is also a key to feeling like you get it.",

I learnt enough to get myself through the door and the rest of it was learning on the job and solving real world problems with real world data. I think it’s great you are looking to be SQL certified but you shouldnt be worried if it has not “clicked” yet.Learn the basics like how to pull data, filter with WHERE, group by for aggregation and then move onto more advanced things like CTE’s , JOINs , window functions and i would say you are 90% there - atleast from an Analyst standpoint.Use this to try and solve problems, there are many websites where you can practice SQL problems with difficulty levels mentioned and if you are able to solve these I think you should consider yourself 90% there.",

That's not as clear cut.Just store for each lesson the time it was completed at, and then for the \"next\" lesson you can just get the most recently completed with a single query and suggest the next one as long as it's still within the limits of how many there are. If the queries are taking a while, you can consider denormalizing and having a table that is literally just the most recent completion (or the next lession to suggest) so that you can fetch it more quickly.You may also want to consider event sourcing, it's probably more complex to learn/setup the first time, but you can then retroactively apply different display logic after the fact since the events are all available to reconstruct how the currrent state was reached. HOWEVER, if it's your first app I would just go the standard CRUD way first and maybe consider trying to do event sourcing after to compare/contrast the strengths and weaknesses yourself.",

She also has courses on full-stack web dev, iOS app dev, and various others. It's a good way to get out of the funk it sounds like you're in.Otherwise, I'd say give yourself a break, friend. You already have more knowledge than you realize; you just need to dive back in and *keep up the momentum*. A video course like the ones above are good for keeping up that momentum, and you'll end up with some projects that show your skills. Plus they're easy to build into bigger, more impressive projects.And you don't need to be terrified. You've had a bad experience, now it's time to move on.Best of luck, and enjoy the ride!",

Can think of it as loop and replace each element with the result of f.filter -> perform boolean function on each element in the array only keeping those that match the predicate.reduce -> can be used in lots of different ways but commonly I use it as a map and a filter combined so I don't need to do .map and then .filter on the result but you can also use it to take an array to object or other complex data transformations that can't be done via other array functions.There are a bunch of other methods you can use in a library called lodash which you should learn if you can.Also I would recommend using typescript as it holds your hand and makes sure what you are programming is safe.",

In the second one you ask what a \"beginner\" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.If you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.If you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.If you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.If you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers. Since that wasn't your goal anyway, everything will work out fine.",

That means learning about interfaces, generics and type literals, which is nowhere near as hard because I know most of that from Java. The idea I'm getting at is that knowledge of the concepts I learned in Java are helping me now, even though I never use Java. Now change the scenario and let's say I built projects with Java, but had to switch to C or C++. Then I'd be blindsided with memory management and pointers which take a long time to master, and time isn't on your side with so many bills to pay.Languages like Ocaml or Haskell are difficult to learn and I don't see many jobs for them.

I've been programming as a full stack web developer for over half a decade now, and I'd still call myself \"intermediate at TypeScript\". Recently I've been play with a lot of local, open source AI models, even though I never technically learned Python (and even though I suck at math).My point being: It doesn't matter where you are in your programming journey, you cannot look at it like \"OMG, there's so many things to learn\". There is ALWAYS more to learn. If you spent 100 years learning one thing, you'd die before you learned \"everything about it\". So you need to just accept where you are, and push in a direction that interests you. Maybe you end up being the programmer that \"only designs buttons\" or maybe you become the programmer that \"builds entire operating systems by themself\". But if you look too far ahead in any one direction, all you'll ever see is \"more to learn\". You can't let that deter you.",

If you're in a course, give me your Syllabus and I can whip up a few practice assignments for you Having structure is very important, so pick up a textbook, use one of your college courses, or enroll in a free online course, something.

Todo list app (without backend)**3. Learn the basics of some frameworks (Use videos, tutorials, documentation again)**1. Pick react for the frontend. It's the most popular, with the biggest community and most resources online.2. Go with node.js (express.js) in the backend.**4. Pick a bigger project (not huge) which you have passion for. Passion is important, because it keeps motivation high.**1. Examples: Full browser game, your own small social media web app2. Don't overthink just start building to the best of your knowledge.3. If you are stuck, ask google, or reddit.4. Maybe you have to rewatch videos, or read more docs5. **Go to step 4.2** and repeat until your project is ready6. Learn about serverless deployment for example cloudflare pages to deploy your app and share it with the world7. Put it on your CVGood luck!",

I would go with him if I wanted to get my hands dirty with C code and learn by doing.Modern C is more careful and through. He spends a lot of time on theoretical considerations and the way you should view the language and the internals of how C works. A lot of time is spent on making sure you are thinking about C in the correct way. If I wanted a deep theoretical understanding of the language I would use this book. Note that Modern C demands more attention and time from you.Both are great books and regardless of whichever you read make sure to donate to the author to support them.

Spotify doesn't make it easy at all to download the audio, it's against their terms of service. And even if you had the audio, automatically determining the chord progression isn't simple or straightforward at all. There may be some advanced AI audio algorithms that try to do it, but I'd expect them to have errors.Honestly the most likely approach would be to fetch the playlist from Spotify, then search for online libraries of lyrics and chords, then try to analyze the chord progression from there. That would be complex but at least plausibly doable. I'm not aware of a centralized database with chord progressions for most songs, but there are plenty of places online that have them in nonstandard formats (often text). Then you'd have to parse various ways to write chords, transpose into the same key to normalize, and count how many are the \"same\".Even determining which is the \"same\" isn't easy. Do you count I, V, vi, IV the same as vi, IV, I, V? What about I, V7, vi, IV? There are lots of chord progressions that are very similar but not identical.",

Keep your school stuff in private repos that only you, collaborators assigned by your professors, and maybe your professors, have access to. Using git and GitHub in school will definitely give you a leg up in professional settings (I met seniors who still had no idea how to do basic git stuff). Tho...

Dodds' beginner React course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react))If you're looking for backend/server-side development, everyone has their own opinions, but generally speaking, you can't really go wrong with Java, Go, or NodeJS (also JavaScript). You could also look into .NET, since you have C# experience. As far as where to start, I like to recommend thinking of a simple app idea (the classic example is a To-do List) and just try piecing it out into bite-sized tasks and plucking away until you have it working. Once you have it working, try and see if you can break it. Enter unexpected characters into an input, put in emojis, try to paste text, try to paste an image. Try to figure out where your code comes up short and then try to fix those issues until you have a solidly working application. Have fun and best of luck!",

Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. I was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. I'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. Anyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. Twitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. Google/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products. Anyways it's all first hand thoughts and super anecdotal. I just don't see why people would go back to hiring as much as they did with the salaries as they were. It was kind of silly and frankly most people I know in FAANG were coasting pretty hard.",

        "body": "If my own manager is anything to go here's my guess: a lot of them start out at technical roles, quickly realize they are not suited for them. They may have \"skills\" that make them better suited for managerial or leadership roles. My manager says he has development experience, but he can't parse simple emails coming from Vendors informing us that they are changing their API tokens etc, and needs a dev to explain what is needed.People who are good at the technical stuff generally do not want the additional responsibilities, stress and the need to deal with other people that comes with being a manager. As an IC, my only interaction is with my team and with my manager, so around 6-7 people in total, and maybe 3 on an average day. My manager on the other hand, on average meets with 10 different people a day and maybe 25-30 people in total over a month. I never see myself as having the bandwidth to be able to tolerate that.In short, tech leadership requires a Goldilocks person who is both reasonably adept at the technical side of what they are managing, and has the managerial and leadership skills that are needed for the role. These people are likely rare and are already at highly compensated roles, and they enjoy what they are doing. That means the rest of the market has to make do with the average and below average candidates, many of whom are the aforementioned people who convert from technical roles to leadership.",

I get it, job listers have leverage at the moment so they get to set the rules, but you can't be mad when you set bullshit standards and wonder why you're attracting bullshit candidates.

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.Look at what you wrote:>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.This is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, \"why don't you just talk to him?\" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.You will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.You should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.So many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.The dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy. Others have done it before, you can follow examples/instructions, etc. Yes, there start to be complications if there are some specific requirements, etc, but you're trying to either overstate how difficult it is, or you're not experienced with it.",

You also throw in a sprinkle of “we are smarter than our bosses” and trivializing THEIR work, which we all do sometimes because…we don’t fully understand it.What you call presentation/politics many people just call “communication” and “soft skills” and it’s every bit as important as tech skills. Part of our job is to help stakeholders understand what they’re asking for. On a good day, you get to drive them towards a particular decision and make them think it was their idea.It sounds like you’re hoping that we, as a discipline, get recognized purely for performance on tasks that are hard to understand, and I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work. Communicating well about complexity is part of the skill set. And sometimes building a rickety MVP is critical for time-to-market, which can make or break the entire product.",

Even if it is 100% backend, that's still the end goal as there is always a front end somewhere. Those MBA's you're complaining about are your customers. And yes, the customer doesn't always know what it is they really want. They might think they want something but they really want something else. It is also the job of a software dev (at more senior levels) to guide those customers towards something better suited to what they are trying to accomplish.In short, coding is only part of the job. The higher up you go as a software dev, the less of it you do. As a lead dev, I mostly do requirements gathering, overall solution architecture, give status updates to directors and up and do code reviews for more junior developers. I also do mentoring and training of course. Any coding projects I have are those that I assigned to myself cause I either don't trust someone else to do or because I have some spare time to fill.",

But don't worry, there's automation for that.All you need to do is annotate the data when you capture it, when you store it, and then set up monitoring to ensure that the data doesn't move outside of the environment it's in.

You'll need to ensure someone is paged if the data goes to the wrong place.That's step 1.Then you can start writing the API.",

Here’s what I did:- neetcode 150 to stay fresh.- hellointerview for system design, watch enough videos until you can do them yourself. Set up job alerts at every company you are interested in. Then go to LinkedIn jobs, indeed, and GlassdoorJobs and set up alerts there as well. On LinkedIn you can search for most recent job postings. It defaults to 24 hours. You can manually change the number in the url to much lower, like 4 hours. The earliest applicants have a much higher chance of getting hired. I wouldn’t bother looking for remote, they are tough to get. Look for something in office or hybrid. And yeah unemployment asap. There is light at the end of the tunnel, it just takes a while sometimes. I sent out over 1000 resumes and only got 4 responses. Send out as many as you can. Reformat your resume to be ATS friendly and make sure to change the bullet points from “list of tasks” to include what the impact of your work was. “Increased speed of X by Y%”, stuff like that. Need measurable results on there. You can have ChatGPT massage your resume to match keywords for specific job descriptions, but lots of recruiters are savvy to this now, you don’t want to be a 100% match. Any more questions I’ll try to help. Good luck :)",

I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. I immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. Apply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. Reach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. Start applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. While applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. I used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. You’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. I was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. You also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. Lastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband. You got this!",

At the time of my last interview, I was writing typescript and react code daily for a side project, so I was entirely in my element.So if it's C# that's popular, practice and level up your proficiency with C# and .NET, if it's Java, then get good with Java and Spring or whatever. Also, think of difficult problems you've solved or ran into in the past. Document how you solved them, and have a good answer for this kind of question. It comes up in pretty much every interview I've had and always opens up a conversation going into more detail, and I feel like thats the best position to be in during an interview; a discussion where you get to take the lead and control the conversation.",

But it is a legit point that anybody in his position should be considering. He himself said he changes jobs every couple of years and doesn't have \"expert level\" (which might just be mid that he thinks is \"expert\") in any one language. The odds seem high he's fallen into the classic trap of 6x 1YOE rather than having 6YOE? If so, then no wonder he's struggling badly in mid level interviews in this current job market. Thus this is an aspect he needs to urgently address, but we can't even get to the point of discussing how to do this, if he won't even discuss it as a possibility.Edit 2, to reply to u/Azureflames20:> I feel like if you’re someone who takes this much offense to a valid possible criticism, there’s some bigger ego issues to work on and squish.Yeah I'd bet money on the fact he doesn't just have technical skills he needs to work on, but is lacking in soft skills areas as well, that are likely coming through during the interviews.Edit 3, a reply to u/mariogario123:> So why is someone who stuck around for 6 years going to be knowing more than someone who jumped every, let’s say, 1.5 years. Am certainly not saying 6yrs is the optimal time to stay at a company! (from the employee perspective... )But if you're jumping every year or two, then do you truly get to see the full entire SDLC? And thus truly feel the ramifications of the decisions that are made way back at the start. Or are you jumping too early every time to learn the lessons? Don't think we can say there is one magic \"optimal number\", depends so much on: the person, the company, market conditions, and more.Edit 4, a reply to u/evanescent-despair:> So what should someone who’s jobless even do if they have a 6x 1YOE situation?Well, first of all they need to recognize it, as then it is easier to come up with a plan to fix it. They might even find this realization freeing. As if you're 6YOE deep into a career, you might feel yourself \"stuck\" in it with \"golden handcuffs\" (or at least silver plated handcuffs). And you can't just give this up and take a big drop / step back into a new career instead. However, if you're just at 1YOE into it reality, then it's much easier to decide upon a career pivot?While if they *do* decide to stick with it, they need to figure out their strengths and weaknesses, so they can play to their strengths and patch up their weaknesses to at least competent mid level. Because they need to quickly be able to \"fake\" being mid/senior level and even better in the long run *actually become* mid/senior level ability. As likely they're coming across in interviews and their CV as someone who is *not* mid/senior and interviewers are smelling this from a mile away. And nobody wants a 6YOE Junior!",

I suggest just look for one single ticket you can close. Probably there is something like \"verify the results of regression testing.\" Then in your stand up you say you ran the regression tests and logged the results and verified the fix was successful. In SCRUM meetings you're just supposed to say you did so-and-so or a single task and today you will be doing another task - so you state what that task will be. Probably if I was the manager I might wonder what are you going to be doing today? You kind of need someone in the team you are on to be a mentor to you so reach out to some of the other team members and try to become friends with them. Then explain to them your feelings and ask for help identifying what you should be doing each day.

When is AI gonna make money?\". Meta is paying several millions of dollars for individual AI researchers. Warren Buffet liquidated over a billion in shares and is holding cash. *Nvidia alone accounts for 7.3% of the entire S&P 500*, which is insane.There are a dozen signs from employment to inflation that were already in a recession. The current administration's desperation to lower interest rates shows they know somethin bad is about to happen, and they're firing anyone who threatens to break the dam by being honest about the numbers (e.g. the Labor Bureau head).So it's gonna get worse. It's going to get a lot worse... And then it will get better. But, there's signs this is going to be the big one. The president controlling the Federal reserve threatens to cause hyper inflation. Our debt to GDP ratio restricts our ability to print money and bail out failing companies. I think we're really going to struggle to spend our way out of this one, because foreign interests aren't buying our debt.So my advice is pay down debt. Save aggressively if you can. Maybe don't take out any big loans, and probably don't quit if you've got a job. Probably get out of that door dash habit, and tighten up your subscription services.

CS is kind of in a perfect storm environment. I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years. However, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. I don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience are going anywhere. I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc. The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto, Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.People talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,I also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs. I think any company that is relying on AI to be the drive for their innovation will probably fall behind in the long term.",

Only established people and the 10x devs will survive, and they will earn bigger paychecks than ever. Tech as a field will continue to grow, and there will be ways to profit immensely from it. However, simply being a decent developer in a certain tech stack is no longer sufficient to stand out. Sure, some people will get lucky and land good roles, but that's what it is: luck (but they will still delude themselves when they come on this sub and call it hard work).I like to compare it to the DBAs of the first dotcom bubble. Tons of companies had large in-house IT teams and DBAs who made good money. The rise of cloud services and MSPs made them less relevant. Obviously there are still jobs in that industry, but it is more competitive and less lucrative today.

        "body": "Hard disagree as someone who is currently an IC, has been a manager, and in both roles have conducted quite a few interviews. I conducted over a dozen last month.For the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).When I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just * How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).Don't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

        "body": "> It's also pretty easy to create a practical coding test in gitpod, and then do point-based scoring. But most managers never thought of that, nor attempted to do so. They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.I'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.I have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.---As for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.Yes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

If I did that, Bob would hate me, and we would get in a debate about why it’s late, but from a business perspective, it doesn’t matter why. Everyone just needs to know it’s delayed so that we don’t advertise something that doesn’t exist, and so management can decide what to do next. (Let it be late? Allocate more people? Pull the plug?)No, I am going to use corporate speak to keep everything calm and neutral. Things are just happening, not through the actions of individuals. “Project Walrus has been delayed, we now predict a launch date in Q1.” If I feel the need to bring up that it’s Bob’s laziness and stupidity causing the holdup, that’s going to be a very different, much more private conversation.",

See *use case* and *hack*.Another thing that happens is that specialized language can convey a higher status. I’ve found that when I speak in the plainest, simplest terms I can, I’m not seen as intelligent or expert as people who use highfalutin words, which confer an automatic degree of prestige.And I have interacted with middle managers who use specialized language and passive voice specifically in order to remove as much meaning as possible from their communication so they can’t be held accountable for anything. But they have to appear engaged and knowledgeable. I was working out the messaging in a public-facing piece of software, and the manager I was speaking with said “Oh, let’s use passive voice. Passive voice is good.” He didn’t want the public to be able to identify him as the source of a policy.I had a coworker once whose utterances were filled with a mix of corporate speak and technical terminology. I eventually realized that he had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, and he didn’t even realize it.

We haven't used it for years. But in documentation and informal conversation \"what's your LDAP?\" became synonymous with \"what is your username in our network?\" This persisted even after LDAP was deprecated. It's now been picked up on by people who have joined the company long after that deprecation. So you have non-technical people who have no clue what LDAP even is asking \"what's your LDAP\" when we haven't even used LDAP for like a decade and they joined a year ago.",

I oversee 10 devs so if you're responsible for more than that YMMV.with this i often can get 4 decent hours of focused work a day, getting most reviews done early in the day and then near eod.

With a slow interview process, I was able to get up to speed on all the other parts, and by the time I got to a a hiring manager I felt pretty good. Now I'm a team lead at that job, lol.The biggest difference, is that to be successful today, versus in 2020, is that companies are being a bit more picky. Whether that's judging pedigree/experience with more scrutiny, or making the interview process longer and involving more steps with higher bars.Either way, making a step up is very much possible, but you'll likely have to learn the interview process and invest time into the various skills: pitching yourself, LC (or whatever knowledge base is required for ML), systems design (esp. LLM serving, ML systems), and finally behavioral.Personally, I'll jump in about 18 months if I don't make Staff and can't switch orgs, and I'm planning about a 6 month period of interview prep, some LC, lots of sys design, and really focus on behavioral. I'm definitely a corporate-type, neoliberal and process-based thinker, and if you can lean into that it really helps.",

Do you have friends in developer roles at your company, or even better, engineering managers? You gotta start making some if not. Pick up any projects you can that will get you working more closely with dev teams. Once you have a decent contact or 2 in engineering, just grab lunch with those persons and have a frank conversation with them that you’re looking to transition to development and ask what you would need to be able to demonstrate to get moved into a junior role.Having a level of rapport and trust with individuals making hiring decisions is 1000x more important for landing a role than a degree of experience.

My experience is that most Juniors don’t know much coming out of college and that is ok. But, if they are passionate and approach things with the attitude of “I don’t know this but I can learn it” then they generally do pretty well. So, in the interview if you are interviewing with someone like me you get extra points for admitting you don’t know something and taking a stab at it if you have an idea or saying you can ramp up on it. If you follow up after the interview with a well researched answer as well as your thoughts it will make you a top candidate in my eval. Just don’t copy/paste someone else’s, this includes AI, answer. I need to see that you taught yourself something.Also on my teams I want people to be willing to ask the “dumb questions” they think everyone already knows. More times than not it clarifies what we are doing and fills in holes I didn’t realize were there. Sometimes I just completely missed something and it is my turn to learn something.

That means hiring mostly interns the fall before the summer when they’ll work, then converting the best to full time employees once they’ll graduate. If there weren’t enough intern conversions, they will open up to hire full time directly, but still on the same schedule and process. There’s a sense that the best students get jobs through this process, and there must be something wrong with anyone “left over”. Like either they didn’t get a return offer from any internships or could not pass interviews. Anyone who did get through this process but is looking for a job with less than a year or two of experience is viewed skeptically as well. They’re viewed as not much more experienced than a new grad, but might have been fired or laid off because they can’t actually deliver. Intern pipeline is seen as less risky because you get 12 weeks to see how someone works. No, it’s not fair but it stresses the importance of getting a good internship that’s likely to result in a return offer.It also shows how going back to school for a masters can play to your advantage by putting you back into the intern university recruiting pipeline.",

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience? The answer to this question is \"get more experienced\".I say this as someone who entered the industry in my 40s, with no CS background, no college, no bootcamps, no professional contacts in the field. \"How do I get hiring managers to consider me?\" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me? And even if I have a disposition to consider more oddball candidates, given my background, there's still an ATS and a literal army of recruiter between me and our candidate pipeline, so I really never even get to see candidates who are oddball. Those are filtered out long before the candidate is talking to me.I'm interested to hear what other people here will say. I'm sure there are other ways to skin this cat. But the solution I settled on was to change my approach and expectations. I stopped applying for SWE and started applying to roles that were adjacent to, or had some plausible path to, where I wanted to be. I had zero impressive experience you could put on a resume, so I had to start far away, in (non-technical) customer support in my dream company. If you have some impressive experience but not impressive enough for a SWE role, you might consider something like Solutions Architect if you're more into operations, or some kind of Data Analyst role if you spike on the SQL/mathematical/statistical side.Find companies you think would be good to work for, and start looking through their open roles. Don't limit yourself to only the specific role you think you want next (and for which 100% of employers are ghosting you on).\\*Sure maybe once in a blue moon this happens for mostly unique or at least impractical reasons (\"candidate has 200k followers on Twitter and a strong social media brand as a SWE influencer\", \"candidate is a maintainer on some piece of OSS that is important to us\", etc), but by and large it's not a thing.\\*\\*\\*\\*Also my answer is calibrated specifically for your situation: breaking into the industry. If this question is coming from someone farther along in their career, the answer is different.",

Normally, hiring folks out of university is seen as an OK investment. The hiring pipeline assumes that for every university hire, maybe 80% of them leave (voluntarily or otherwise) before 5 years. Those 80% give you workhorses that aren't exactly cash cows, but keep the business running. The folks who stay on long term tend to be high performers who carry onward business knowledge.It's no longer acceptable to just have an \"OK\" investment from the budgeting process. I've been involved in presenting proposed bodies of work all the way up to the CFO of a F500. Effectively, the view from executive management is that every project needs to be a home run out of the park in order to get approval in the current environment. That means you need to staff it with experienced people who already know the business domain, and can execute quickly without any hand holding - because the promised timelines to executives are aggressive. I've directly been told by middle management to \"accelerate\" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.That means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now. The only thing that will fix that are lowered interest rates, or you try to apply for companies which aren't cash strapped. That inherently means AI or crypto companies at the moment, which in themselves will have stability issues.",

I only want maybe 25 at the top of the pipeline at any given time, so I start at the top of the pile and work my way through resumes finding potentially qualified candidates for a recruiter screen until I get to that number and then I stop. Even if only 10% of candidates are qualified, I’m probably not looking at any resumes beyond the first 250 for at least a few after the job is posted and even then, it’s only if recruiter screens and first round interviews have an abnormality high failure rate.At my company at least, if you’re referred by a current employee, we guarantee a recruiter screens.

I haven't really programmed anything in like 3-4 months other than a few small scripts in Python or Bash. Due to layoffs, I was forced into a senior software engineer role that oversees the infrastructure as code (IaC) that keeps my company running.The IaC I helped build out over the last year was supposed to get a 6-month Early Access that got cut short by about 3 months, so now we have production systems running on IaC that isn't quite ready yet. This lead to a few outages and upper management (CIO included) wanting to kill my project, forcing me to justify *every single update* we make. On top of that, I'm fighting internal politics, favoritism, poor communication and coordination. Not to mention all the fast paced changes causing documentation problems left and right (apparently, my department leadership doesn't believe in documentation... fml)I'm getting plenty of awards and recognition, but I hate my job.",

That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.A company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.That, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. \"Do you have a good WLB?\" --> \"Yep!\". Easy peezy.Instead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.For example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no \"right\" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.If an interviewer said something like \"The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds\" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.Another example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.Again, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***. Not a month. I politely rejected that company.Think about what makes up a good WLB *to you*. Then develop questions asking about those things.",

        "body": "4.0 is still impressive, but in recruiting I rarely saw gpa alone would be able to carry someone past the first screen unless there was proof of work/skills aka internships, right now you’re in the I know you're smart and disciplined but untested for work bucket, which is tough when lots of grads already have internships on their resumesThat said, there's alwasy things to try and hope to come with it, lots of the stress coming from don't know what to do and so stressed that I can't do anything, I been there for my work before, feel like the stress paralyzed me that I can't do anything, but the second you start to do your first task, you feel more in control and better about yourself, core is that you just need visible evidence that you can build and deliver, if you can build and deliver, learn how to do that and build a case around it it's kinda popular right now to start an AI-based project, especially workflow automation, even a small workflow automation tool or ML/coding/data side project can stand out right now since every company is experimenting with AI, and experienced or not, everybody is on the same startline so there's opportunity, and you can contribute to open source or team hackathons. Doesn’t need to be huge, what matters is having some results and something public to point to, or offer your skills to NGOs you care about, there's a platform called catchafire, that's skillbased volunteer matching, nonpaid of course, but if matched, you get to work on a real project, tbh, if you have a cause that you want to help out, just reach out to the local ngos, they would mostly likely love to have you and didn't even have the HR capacity to run and recruit proper internships prograns or you can look into job simulations experiences from forage or springpod, they're pretty much the same, 2-3 hours long program in different fieldds for you to test out and list on resume, not work experience, but as ECA or project experience, low impact but very low investment so still pretty good ROI, or the longer externships, they're mostly 8-12 weeks, proper professional experience that supports backgorund checks, but you need to actually do 50-80 hours work on the platform to list this on your resume as work, you might learn something while donig it, and they’re short, flexible, and give you real-world bullet points fast. and don’t limit yourself into SWE only. Apply to product analyst, technical program manager, ops/automation roles or data, they overlap a ton with software and can get your foot in the door, pay and outlook probably less than top SWEs, but at this point, I would say anything in tech would be a win, later, pivoting back to SWE is much easier once you’re “inside.”one last probably bad idea but good if you have the money, if you’re strong academically and open to it, a master’s can reset your “new grad” status, that puts you back in campus recruiting pipelines with way better odds, think if you can get into CMU for machine learning, that's a totally difference picture now",

If your resume is just your degree/classes, projects, and absolutely no work experience then you might be cooked. If you do have some work experience, then this might 100% be a resume issue. Another recommendation could be a masters. If you go down that route, your focus should be on networking, joining clubs, initiatives, extracurriculars and focusing on doing whatever you can to get in the industry. Classes are going to be secondary. Dont aim for straight As, just aim to pass. Anyways, from what you are describing this is most likely a resume issue unless you have 0 work experience",

That said, there's things you can do that will help.Break your team's responsibilities down into pillars or silos of knowledge (your manager can help with what your team specifically works on). Usually, it's these:* Infrastructure/Networking* Application Orchestration* Observability* Internal ToolsTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.When you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.Total honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.All that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

Why the quotes around \"impressive\" and \"expected\"? Are those the measures that you think exist, or are they not?>I don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays.Well, then either, you are correct and everybody that does have a job is simply amazing - in which case: if you want to flip a burger right, it's all in the wrist action! Or you're full of shit and overly dramatic, and that's cool and all, but it will not actually help you to get a job.> If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in.Companies do not give out jobs due to the goodness of their hearts! News at eleven!>No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.You forgot \"pointless\", because the vast, vast majority f developers is not getting hired for their million dollar ideas. and I honestly have no idea what could possibly make you think otherwise.

Learn React, HTML, CSS. Fire are you getting data? Learn hire to build an API in the language and framework of your choice. The more popular and standard you are, the better your chances of finding a job. Whenever I see a resume that focuses on what was built vs what tools were used, I get sad. Making a monopoly clone isn’t the important part. But knowing how to build the different parts is. Working on game mods is great and can be supplemental information, but unless you’re trying to work for a gaming company or work with that tech, it’s not that helpful. Oh, you made node for World of Warcraft using Lua. That’s great, but we’re need someone who knows Python and has used Pandas. If you’re building “the next great thing,” you shouldn’t be working for some random company. But most of us won’t be building that next great thing. If you want a “normal” job, show some familiarity with the tools and concepts. It’ll make you a better candidate than the one building abstract school projects. PS - you can continue working in the next best thing in your spare time. There’s still a numbers game going on right now, but you want to get the numbers aligned with you as much as possible.",

The reason being that your current employer might resent you for forcing their hand and look for a way to get rid of you later. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, and have taken the counter-offer in the past without negative repercussions. I did leave that employer 6 months after taking the counter-offer when I got an even better offer, so it didn't really work out for them, but it was good for me.* Your compensation is on the low end for the senior SWE in a super expensive city, especially given the RTO requirement. The fact that you secured another offer, and your current employer wants to keep you, means you could likely do better.* Outside of compensation, there might be other benefits to working at the current company. E.g. You might get good leadership experience in the new lead role. Think about whether it might be possible to move within your current company to work under a different manager.* If you aren't able to switch teams while staying at your current employer, I'd probably recommend taking the other offer, based solely on the fact that you described the current team as \"quite toxic\". Hopefully the new role will be pretty chill, and you'll have time to upskill on your own, then seek out an even better offer.",

However, if you’re working alongside other Seniors and they’re not doing the level of team management you’re doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn’t have Leads, that’s a very different situation.There are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there’s what’s called a “Tech Lead Manager”, which is sort of in between the two – usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don’t do salary review, etc.One useful way to frame this is, “I’m enjoying the work I’m doing to lead (or ‘help lead’) the team, and I’d like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I’m doing the highest impact things?”Basically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine… and is often not fine for reasons that you don’t have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there’s something fundamental that you’re missing, you’re better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you’re not being promoted.Depending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",

The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of \"wasted\" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \\_only\\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. Coding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, \"beyond human\" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, \"code\" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. Basically it would look a lot like how ML \"brains\" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect. A beyond human program would work the same way, a black box that we just test until it does what we want it to do.",

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And \"stability\" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.Unit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.\"better than human\" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.One example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a \"better than human\" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.Better than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. \"Difficult to extend\" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch. It doesn't *need* an elegant solution that doesn't need to be re-written with every little change.Your chess analogy isn't really that great here. All the elements of chess are inherent to the existence of chess. An AI is just learning to play the game. But a significant amount of the elements that make up *human* programming are not inherent to *programming*.",

My org pays our test strategy/automation people ~15% on top of the comparable software engineering pay band because the intersection of \"qualified to do the work\" and \"interested in doing the work\" is hard to find. We expect those people to be smarter than the engineers they work with; They need to catch things the senior and junior folks missed.> Part of me thinks I should just tough it out and keep grinding, but I’m genuinely unsure what the right move is.One thing you can be sure of is that anyone giving you a definitive \"do this!!1111 youre an idiot if you don't!!!\" answer is probably wrong.

Get better, build rare skills, etc and you’ll always be in demand, up until (if) we develop true ASI. When that time comes you can join an electrician apprenticeship program or something lol.",

That's why I said my experience is \"probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE\" because I actually have been writing code for 9 years now, but if I were picked up and dropped into the industry as-is, I'd probably only be about as good as 2nd-year professionals. I'm basing that on the fact that my skills are far ahead of any other entry-level candidate I've seen so far, but even farther behind any senior dev.Your last paragraph is (I think) great advice and that's a change I just recently made in my job search.

Technical writing, product management, business analysis, project management, and sales engineering all leverage your tech background while moving away from pure development work.Data analysis roles in non-tech industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics often need people who understand both technology and domain-specific problems. Your programming background makes you valuable for automating processes or building internal tools.Teaching or training - bootcamps, corporate training programs, or educational content creation - let you use your technical knowledge to help others learn. Many former developers transition into developer relations, technical recruiting, or consulting roles.The current tech job market difficulties don't necessarily mean the entire industry is collapsing. Many experienced developers are finding opportunities, just with longer search times and more competition than previous years.Before pivoting completely, consider whether you're dealing with temporary market conditions or genuine disinterest in technical work. The job search frustration might be influencing your desire to leave the field entirely.Non-tech pivots often require starting over salary-wise and building new professional networks. The grass isn't necessarily greener in other industries, many of which have their own challenges with job security and advancement.If you do pivot, choose something that genuinely interests you rather than just escaping current difficulties. Career changes work better when driven by positive attraction to new opportunities rather than just running away from current problems.",

If you frame it as “hey I can pick up this task but I’m currently working on X, is this higher priority?” He isn’t just offloading work, he’s now thinking about how this task is going to fit into the sprint.Another thing I started doing was to add “unplanned” tags to any task that was given to me mid sprint, so at the end when I’m questioned on why I didn’t finish everything I could point to the 5 unplanned tasks I got. Also it’s just good as a team to know how much unplanned tasks people are doing. These suggestions assume your manager is a somewhat reasonable person. If they aren’t then they unfortunately might be expecting you to work extra to get this stuff done.",

Basically, I did two things - find a specific problem domain that’s interesting to me, and learn C++. C++ is a crappy language. When we would interview people for C++ jobs, we would ask what was one thing they hated about the language, and if they didn’t have anything we could tell they hadn’t really used it in anger. But, it allows a specific balance of access to the hardware and programming abstractions that’s hard to beat. There are various C++ style guides that give advice on what small slice of the language is best to use - Google’s is pretty good, for example. Most of the C++ jobs out there are in interesting and in-demand problem areas, and often pay very well. Very few people are paying C++ devs to make CRUD apps.",

Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here’s what I did:1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What’s the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. 2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they’re requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone. 3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can’t make the fix. This may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. You have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they’re trying to push for that fix. You’re an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time. What’s the worst that happens, they get rid of you? You were planning on quitting anyway.",

Worked a few months in a freelance kind of gig, but that stopped early this year.I suggest focusing on getting a local job if you don't have one, primarily. Part-time ideally. So that you can cover your own bills and have time to invest in yourself. I am talking basic stuff like food, phone bill, some socialising, but not rent. If you have just graduated then trust me, the difference between NO income and ANY income is massive. You don't want to rely on your parents too much, at least I did not. Then you can start thinking about how to invest in yourself with that income (so certs if you think that is wise) to get into a sort of specialised labour with higher income potential. This is the route that I am going, after being a try hard for quite a while.I am essentially following this video: https://youtu.be/r\\_58zPgArb4?si=nmHVEWPGYKFpSVjm. It is under 10 minutes. It made sense to me. If it makes sense to you, then figure out where you are and focus on the next level.But don't just blindly follow this comment, as I am not where you want to be. Consult with a friend or relation who is where you want to be and confirm if it makes sense. It makes sense for MY particular circumstance, but maybe YOURS is different.Have fun!",

Explain in your counter your current value (and recent big wins you’ve given the company).Asking for 15-20% seems reasonable. Although, even if you get away with that, say a 15% raise, that probably means next pay adjustment period instead of getting a ~3% adjustment they’ll just skip the raise and say “well you just got promoted and we gave you the extra little bit in negotiations”. In other words, it may just all wash out to not much in the end.Again, I’m shellshocked. You describe a company with policies in place to let them be obstinate and slow in pay raises. Since they control and purse strings and the policies, they can always point at the policies they made and say their hands are tied. That’s my experience.",

At that point, you can take the offer to your manager and decide what you want to do.In the first 5 years of my career, I did this every year and either got a raise or switched jobs. I dont regret it. Also, one of those early managers who kept me on with a 20% raise is still a friend who I have worked with at 2 other companies since. I dont think any good manager will take it personally. And if they do, you dont want to work there anyway.",

The point of college is to facilitate aspirations for more exclusive, highly skilled jobs, not popular, low barrier to entry jobs. Another definition of popular is common or prevalent. Of course the popular stack is saturated, it's right there in the name. Do something less popular, you’re getting too easily influenced by the noob army narrative that tries to shame people for being too awesome.",

Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.For quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.The harsh reality is that \"quickly\" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.Focus on financial preparation over trying to become \"layoff-proof\" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.Consider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.The confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",

Each line takes less than a minute to add, and at the end, you'll be able to calculate your offer rate, then make a new sheet for the next job hunt.Google sheets is really the app to do this, even if you save a minute, or 30 seconds with some hypothetical app, if you spend more than an hour or two figuring this out and implementing something better, it's still a time waste.",

Find research that interests you and that you actually want to explore - then do good work and have something to show for it. Having an interest in the field you are researching will aid in that \"do good work\" part. If you pick up research you don't have any interest in just to improve your resume an unfortunate but likely outcome is that you don't make meaningful progress in that research, have nothing to show or speak toward for it, and thus did indeed lose out on that time that could have been dedicated elsewhere.",
