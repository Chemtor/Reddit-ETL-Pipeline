Why? Even if you’re not using it day to day in a DE role, you’re likely to encounter something of a systems design interview with at least some of the companies that you’ll interact with where you’ll be asked to describe the system you would have implemented and how you’ll go about scaling it. If anything, having the ability to do this will give you a significant leg up on other candidates.Anyway… I was previously in similar shoes as yours, and the way I went about prepping for interviews - picked up a few Raspberry Pi devices, installed Ubuntu - installed k3s as a lightweight kubernetes distribution- used helm to install Kafka, debezium, spark, minio, Postgres- went through some tutorials to wire up a basic data pipeline - built out a CDC pipeline from Postgres to debezium, to Kafka which was batch ETL’d via Spark to Hudi tables hosted on minio block storage - then hammered the hell out of it with test datasets from Kaggle and similar sources to flex and stress the pipeline, lathered, rinsed, repeatedCould be an unpopular opinion ^^ but food for thought ;)",

Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.Also new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.For almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025My point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders? It’s great that you’re working with sources with well-defined schemas, but social media platforms do not keep things consistent for long, always introducing and redefining metrics and post types. Keep all the columns.",

        "body": "I’m a DS so what do I know. But here’s my two cents.I work at an org with a hybrid cloud approach. We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.The Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.Notice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.What’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.What stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. So while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.Another benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.A nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",

I'm usually mostly deploying and using data warehouses to handle my Transformations, and really don't like debugging spark as I've had some pretty nasty configs and silent bugs ruin many pipelines... so I aim for the most possibly documentable tech... (BigQuery like warehouseing + dbt for example).But i've been seeing databricks being used everywhere lately and I wonder if having this knowledge/degree could be beneficial.",

Knew the low hanging fruit architectural questions (what is Kimball data modeling, what is a data warehouse vs lake house etc.) and could answer basic Python/SQL questions. During the interview he was drinking tea, wearing stained clothing etc. and his kid barged in during the middle of it. You can debate if that is acceptable in 2025 but whatever. A day after the interview he sent an email to HR demanding that if we didn't give him an offer by end of day that we were incompetent at hiring. So basically insulted everyone at the company and then expected the job. It took months to find someone that would take less than 180-200k for a mid level niche industry job and had at least bear minimum professionalism and technical competency.",

I wouldn't worry about trends to this extent, but just make sure you have your fundamentals down and don't coast so much if you can tell that you are getting super rusty and extremely complacent. Other than that, there is not all that much to do besides being a good employee and teammate and trying to work with data scientists or other stakeholders to make their lives as easy as possible. There are more practical things like understanding getting structured outputs from AI using things like instructor (and maybe how to do evaluations so that you can track the performance of your AI related code), but that's probably enough for most of what you need.I just say this because your title sounds very buzzwordy / salesy and I would be worried that you are falling too much into the camp of trying to be the 'AI guy' who is gonna catch onto AI this month, but I would implore you to keep a level head, work hard, and have a true desire to just be an excellent data engineer and employee rather than get too fixated on stuff that isn't gonna move the needle all that much for you imo.Hopefully, I haven't come off as too rude or misunderstood you. Apologies if I did.EDIT - I suspect that you will probably be downvoted a lot as well as a result of mentioning missing web 2.0, and because of the wording of your title.

The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution. I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.Scala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.So for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay.

Other languages are all fine and good when all your data is super well behaved and you have control of it at every layer. Python really is the goat for handling flaky weird sorts of stuff coming from systems outside of your control. This is why Python has largely won this particular race. Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.That said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects. Then your actual business logic Python code can simply check that it receives an object of the type it expects irrespective of internal complexity of those objects and their construction.",

If you’re constantly moving things from multiple platforms onto the same platform that would make sense. Or if you’re doing proof of concepts across other platforms it could make sense. But typically you pick a platform (AWS + Snowflake or GCP + BigQuery, etc) and stick to it.Data vendors with unique formats:- outside of a few industries like specific things are standardized for interoperability(healthcare, logistics, banking), it’s pretty common for each vendor even for the same “flavor” of data to do it their own unique way.- Ex. I work largely with POS (point of sale) data and literally every POS provider implements things differently and we have to standardize how order discounts, line item discounts, taxes, refunds and partial refunds are handled per system. They also come in all different formats - JSON via API, CSV via S3, TXT via SFTP and we have to have a pipeline per vendor.Tribal knowledge:- Yup, pretty common. Most teams suck at documentation. We have started hiring dedicated business analysts into our DE team so that they can document sources for our teams of analysts.- 4 years into a role I still find out some new random fact about how data is handled in our company. Same for a coworker that’s been here 15 yearsAs-hoc ingestion:- Fortunately we have a roadmap of priority sources to ingest. But if a big enough client or a VP in the business starts getting loud about needing something then ultimately their new source gets prioritized. And we almost never have analysts or subject matter experts on the data we’re ingesting. So it’s usually ingest it and then see what complaints we get. Sucks lol",

For many reasons, I see data engineering more as a general discipline with different flavors that use different tools and may serve different purposes.

There are 100% data engineers who do “deeper”engineering work and function like SWEs.

        "body": "I was a software engineer for nearly 15 years. Worked in mobile, desktop, web development. I write network and security automation stuff for fun. My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data. My track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation). I am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...) Any pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history. I was just lucky that I had all the soft skills in my back pocket so I could get promoted easily. re: stakeholder stuff, I've always had to do things and figure out requirements on my own, so I think you need to develop that part of your brain a bit.",

Aside that, in both cases I had to talk with stakeholders to gather requirements and have to understand hard skills to design, deploy, debug and optimize my solutions. In that meaning I think that data engineering is a subset of a software engineer, you need to know which SWE tools you should focus to solve your specific problem. That is the same for any engineer such as a front-end, back-end, computer graphics or embedded devices.Personally having experience as both for me makes me able to talk with any kind of engineer to understand how data is generated and how it can be integrated in any part of a system (from internal data generation until front-end). Of course each company has a different concept of the same role. In this case I believe that what your company takes in consideration for a DE doesn't align with what you are expecting for your career.",

The part the DE is mosty bind to will heavily influence its work taks. That parts are:- Ingestion of data: could be low code and config driven. This part has a lot of SWE potential if not low code especially if your company has its own ingestion framework.- transformations - depends how and data is transformed, if by some declarative way like sql then the role feels like analytic engineering more. If transformed in python, then also depends how custom is the transformation framework. The more custom the more SWE. Here also a lot of data analytics and modeling.- Serving data’s - same as ingestion- infra - more dev ops- security …So to sum it up: data engineering is very broad discipline. Depending on the size of project, your role in it and how your company treats data engineering - the role could feel much different.",

We also use checklists inside tickets for things like “Definition of Done” or recurring tasks, which makes it way easier to track what’s left and helps everyone stay on the same pageHaving a roadmap or grouping work into epics in Jira helps us see dependencies and prioritize better, especially when multiple teams are involved. And for new projects, cloning a good template board saves a ton of setup time and keeps things consistent",

When sorting both datasets it makes read access for both datasets predictable, as the data needed to join both sides can be advanced together.I think I am getting your points, but what if both tables are big BUT the hashed table's keys are evenly distributed, wouldn't it make it less likely to through an OOM? Or it is because the Hash table will still remain so big after only selecting the needed keys that it will through a OOM?",

It's a big commitment for someone to move jobs regardless of skill level. However I completely agree that coding platforms can dehumanise the process and be over emphasised/ jumping through hoops.What I've done hiring for my teams is set up a 60 min call, mentioning in advance we'll be talking through some SQL queries for the first half.During the call I'll have a google doc with ever increasing questions that I'd ask to solve via SQL and ask them to roughly write it down. The difficulty depends on level- for juniors you'd start with simple DML- select, where, group by, then having, then progress on to DDL. The point of it being a google doc is that as others have noted, syntax does not matter, but you can see live the thought process and talk over.For seniors I'd start at a higher level, and if mentioned on resume add some python/ language specific questions.It's great to figure out where more junior people are at and what development may be needed, and most seniors breeze through and it sets them up well/ opens up discussion for the rest of the interview where I ask general probing questions about previous roles & projects.However I've also interviewed a ridiculous number of tech leads with 10+ year 'experience' that couldn't understand when to use a group by or explain what it does, even with forewarning.",

Redshift Spectrum has an atrocious load time where we observed 30+ second delays in queries that would cause issues with front ends requesting metrics. So now we've moved away from Spectrum in hopes to remove or lessen the load time. It was the path of least resistance, compared to switching to Athena. Some targeted common queries had comparable query times on average between Redshift (with redshift managed storage) and Athena. Switching to Athena would've been a bit more work to remap objects in ThoughtSpot. Our transformation pipeline running on Athena and DBT costs cents to run each time and the query speeds for that is not super important, at the moment. So its much cheaper for us to transform data there instead of Redshift.We've just barely done this switch from spectrum so we haven't gathered much data on actual speed improvements across the board but we should soon.",

Also not sure off the top of my head what additional destinations they may support now - original post only says \"CES on **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Event Hubs**, with plans to expand support for additional sources and destinations in the future\". There's a email address at the bottom of the post, or I can ask around :).[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/) 2) Fabric MirroringThis is a turn-key \"it just works\" native solution for SQL Server to Parquet in near-real-time - but it has one constraint that may be a non-starter for you - it can replicate to OneLake (which implements ADLS / Azure Blob Storage API), not S3. From there, you could use whatever ADLS-compatible tooling (including Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, et cetera) you like for further OLAP and reporting needs.Announced here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/)Should be quite similar to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database) but for SQL Server 2025.OneLake also supports \"Shortcuts\" to translate between Storage APIs and avoid you having to move all your existing data; but I'm a bit fuzzy off the top of my head whether writes **to** S3 are supported ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut) ) - OneLake is not my area of expertise, especially around the Shortcuts side of things. Dunno if you'll find either of those helpful - depends on if you are willing to upgrade to SQL Server 2025 and your exact requirements - but I thought I'd share in case you weren't aware.

If you're open to non-OSS solutions, Glue can work, but it's not very flexible.also curious: when you say DMS didn’t work well, was it reliability, speed, or something else?

ADF – it's a batch-oriented tool. Good for scheduled pulls or full-table loads, but not built for log-based streaming CDC. Dev UX is also clunky. Fivetran / Airbyte – both batch ETL/ELT tools. Airbyte is not a scalable solution especially for high volume database; whereas Fivetran gets expensive real fast. Custom Python / AWS Glue – definitely an option, but as you mentioned, can become a huge maintenance burden. Hard to scale long-term. If your goal is to stream CDC changes directly to S3 in Parquet without managing Debezium and Kafka or relying on batch jobs, there are a few CDC tools built specifically for this. One example is my company [Artie](http://www.artie.com/), which focuses on log-based replication from transactional DBs like SQL Server into cloud storage with minimal setup. Hope this helps!",

I moved into tech because it was more money, a job I really enjoyed, remote working, tons of opportunities (relative to most fields, IT has way more opportunities in general), and overall nothing but positives. Something you're likely to discover when you go and do something else is how hard it can be outside of IT.If you can live without the money, then it's a no brainer - go and do something you love. Doesn't matter what it is.As other people have mentioned, moving into sideways moves where you're something like a Project Manager, working in sales or Business Development are all viable alternatives as there might be a pay cut but not massively.I worked in a field I hated for 10 years. I just didn't know I hated it. I always recommend for anybody who has worked in IT and gotten used to basically hating their job for money, go and do something you love. Just once to see what it's like. You never know and might find that not being miserable most days is more important than having a massive house or a yacht.",

I have this conversation every day (check username)you’re handling 20 customer dbs, even if they’re not huge, that’s already a lot of repeatable setup. You’ll need automation, monitoring, retries, schema handling, maybe even change data capture. All that adds up & up.So DIY sounds cheap upfront, but you’ve got to factor in **total cost of ownership**:* Time to build* maintenance* Debugging* Onboarding new engineersAnd additionally, something that a lot of people miss:* Opportunity cost (what else you could be building)Sometimes it’s worth buying the tool just to save your team from being stuck in ETL land forever.. but sometimes it makes sense to build it yourself because of environmental restrictions or special requirements.I’d throw together a quick comparison matrix with rough costs (time, effort, reliability) for each option.Doesn’t need to be perfect, just enough to focus on the tradeoffs. Try to shift the conversation from “what’s cheapest today” to “what will cost less over the next year and more”",

I've already got a comparison matrix started, I'll make a point to add more of the long-term costs in there as those do get overlooked/hidden in the \"just write some python\" version of things. Mainly because that means I do it and nobody else feels the pain lol.If you were going from azure sql to azure sql and just wanted to handle the data copy/replication side of things so you could work in dbt from thereafter, is there a favored tool or approach you'd use if you had \\~50 databases each with \\~200 tables? All of which are *mostly* identical in schema, but not totally? Our group is pretty good in dbt and managing CI/CD with it. But handling the replication is what's slowing me down on this project, and all these expensive tools do a lot more than replication, so in a way we don't really need all that functionality if we are cool with dbt (or maybe eventually sqlmesh but IMO it's not quite mature enough yet to where I want to use it at large scale, but maybe that's being overly conservative). Where I've landed for teh \"built it\" version is a data factory pipeline where we try to parameterize as much as we can so it can be deployed. But I'm also kind of attracted to standing up open source airbyte, building out the replication for one database, exporting to json, then parameterizing that and using a github action to deploy wider. Mainly because I think it would probably be cheaper to just run that on a moderately large VM, than pay for a ton of ADF time, which adds up quick.",

And we have these iops and throughput also in real life.Dont know How your storage is configured on the source, but this is the first thing to check.The target RDS r6i.2xlarge has a limitation of 312 MB sec throughput. I would never recommend this kind of instance for Oracle. Storage is the beating heart of Oracle, and you should check the maximum iops and tp as well for the instance as the defined storage.I did the AWS Architecture and cost optimisation (FinOps)for our company for also another 40 Oracle databases on AWS serving besides dwh also business critical applications the last 4 years.If you want more info, you can dm me.",

Then, just filter by those columns when users need to access a specific versionTable snapshots are basically just copies, so they’ll use about as much storage as making a new table.

In cell-based architecture, we develop various products and services in these cells that contain a grouping of cloud-based resources. It's not uncommon to have one of those cloud-based resources be a database or storage like an S3 bucket or blob storage depending on your cloud provider. With proper isolation in the cloud, you may have a database per environment, which leaves production having production data and dev with no data.However, depending how you use the data in said database, which you didn't provide, will give you the key to handling that missing data in dev. For example, if you developed an AWS Lambda Function that needs to connect to that database, read in data, do something with it, then write it somewhere else, then you don't really need production data to test that. You can mock database connection and data to test the AWS Lambda Function code without production data or the live database connection.That being said, if you're testing things like canned reports, dashboards or even ML process, then you just need to look into generating dummy data or completely anonymizing the data much like they do in healthcare. What you **SHOULD NOT DO** is bring over production data into the lower environments because you should treat everything below production as **UNSECURED ENVIRONMENTS**. The reason for that is because until it hits production, everything should be in test mode. The exception may be hot fixes if you branch those off production and staging environments depending on your branching strategies.I say this because while YOUR PRODUCTION DATA may not be sensitive, it's just good practice not to open that can of worms incase sensitive data does accidently spill over because you already opened the door.",

While it might seem cleaner to use a single Postgres database, sharing it can create tight coupling, risk schema conflicts, and complicate upgrades or debugging. Since you're deploying via Docker, isolating their metadata in separate containers keeps things modular, easier to maintain, and aligns with best practices for microservices.",

They came up with a solution they could gradually add resources and scale. But that solution is also terrible in terms of power consumption. Power consumption is always the main factor. The computing is largely a by-product of the available gigawatts of energy. Listen carefully to the latest news in the media.

In general I agree with your sentiment. Streaming tool based pipelines tend to be more costly both to build and operate. A core problem is see with streaming tools is that, in order to be efficient, they implicitly impose constraints and often are intransparent. Both make it harder to build a reliable pipeline. If you need sub second streaming, then this is an acceptable effort overhead.",

        "body": "Ultimately, I don't have a silver bullet, but here's some ideas for you:A) Single-node?????I mean, at 6.5TB, if your code is efficient enough, single-node is 100% feasible. Heck, single enterprise SSDs can be a lot bigger than that these days. But it depends on how much compute you need to do. Also depends on the size of your host / VM / whatever. But a modern mid to high end server can have hundreds of cores and hundreds of GB of RAM and dozens of TB of storage. I generated a certain well-known benchmark dataset at 100TB scale on a single VM once, only took like a day or two with brute force and ignorance. Granted, that VM was either one of the insane Msv2 Azure VMs, or maybe a Standard\\_D96ds\\_v5, been a while. And those don't come cheap if you don't work for the cloud :D .You still do have to think about multi-threading or multi-processing here - but can maybe avoid networking.B) You could try to adapt Spark APIs to SLURM.It's by no means an *easy* thing to do. And I'm not sure if it'd make sense at your scale or not. But very similar has been done before:[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NSDI19\\_paper159\\_CR.pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NSDI19_paper159_CR.pdf)[https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p3148-jindal.pdf](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p3148-jindal.pdf)C) I also came across this from Princeton - might be worth asking them how they do it (unless that's your current institution :D )? I don't see any *horrific* bash scripts in sight, but I do see an independent cluster being set up as you put it, I think.[https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/spark#Before-You-Turn-to-Spark](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/spark#Before-You-Turn-to-Spark)They also call out a few other tools (that I'm not personally very familiar with) like Modin.D) You could wrap your rust tools in a Python API using PyO3 if ease of use of those tools is a major problem?[https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)E) Polars, perhaps? Have heard good things, but haven't used it myself. It's a query engine written in Rust. Would potentially mean you have to write less to build your tools.",

We're definitely resource constrained to a certain extent (i.e.: we're mostly limited to using in-institute resources) but I do have access to a 128vCPU/1TB ram machine, which might do the job, especially coupled with Polars. We are mostly looking into option B though. It would 'relatively' easy to make a python library à la [dask\\_jobqueue](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/) for spark on slurm if we stick to the very basics of what we need (no adaptive clusters, no support for any other schedulers, no fancy anything, just support for initializing workers and master)C is also very relevant. I have actually been trying for a few months to lobby my institute to add spark support similar to what Princeton has. It's a similarly ranked institute but much less proactive when it comes to HPC tools for researchers.",

Why a Postgres database instead of a proper data warehouse like Snowflake or BigQuery?One hurdle that you might face is that some of your ideas, as well as some of those I'm implying in my questions above, cost money. If the volume of data that you're dealing with is small (which it sounds like it is) you might explore more of a lightweight solution like using DuckDB in concert with dbt-core.

What I understood from this is that he hadn't considered keeping me around after my student/apprentice contract is up. In his mind, he can bring another student with Python knowledge to maintain the work I did and improve on it depending on future needs while he maintains control over the work and doesn't get left behind (I didn't write a single piece of code or even control the work I had done, what's important to him is that the exports I generate align with data from other systems, meaning that our work isn't wrong and that the data I generate is correct).I had already worked on a project employing the stack I mentioned in my post and so I suggested showing him a demo. We'll see how it goes from there but do you have any advice on how I could convince him to adopt this proposition or a more refined solution without him feeling like he will get left behind ?

Also, licensing is a big thing in my company so using open source technologies is prefered.Again, I suggested PostgreSQL because it's what I've used so far in my career, it can easily be used as an Relational OLAP Data Warehouse. More so, as stated above, the company generally doesn't use Cloud Storage and everything is stored on-prem.When it comes to volume, the exports from SAP BO stated in my post are done monthly (For now). When I say this, I mean that the data fetched is monthly data and should only be fetched once a month when it is available. However, in cases where our business scope changes, we can for example fetch other information that wasn't necessarily captured during a previous export (by choice or otherwise). Our SAP BO queries are scoped to our business needs which can evolve on stakeholders' demands.Do these clarifications change your input on the matter ?

You can mitigate this to some extent by using more partitions, so that the work is more spread out. To get the benefit of the partitions, you need to either provision more instances of the consumers, or have a mechanism to increase the number of instances when work increases across multiple partitions. This will increase your operating costs.The extent to which hot partitions matters depends on the characteristics of your system and the context in which you work. Do any of your customers make a lot of transactions in a small amount of time? If they did, what rate of transactions could you keep up with?

It may sound exciting but trust me, a lot of being the first hire has nothing to do with actual DE work but is more around understanding how to translate business needs into Data Products, knowing how to push back on stakeholders when they “want near real time” for their dashboards they check daily, etc. These aren’t things you can just “read a blog post” about and be able to do.

Maybe the best solution would be to try some alternatives too, like sqlmesh, make some test implementations (with dbt, sqlmesh...) with actual production data to see how they handle it and keep them as backup plans in the drawer in case that google pulls the plug on dataform so that we have alternatives ready?",

However, there are opportunities in startups that need expertise in building their infrastructure. Additionally, connections with previous employers or professional networks can lead to part-time work.I've also seen freelancers and contractors build strong connections by attending tech meetups or conferences, where they can network, learn from others, and gain insight into the challenges different companies face.I hope this helps, and best of luck!",

This isn't at all a neutral choice. But you likely can't master 3-4 even as a senior. You just forget anyway. So pick maybe 1 main language and a second one. Pick popular one that may sense: Java, Python, javascript, C#.And each ecosystem is strong for some stuff and bad at others. C++ first strength isn't to code web applications for example. Java or python will not work that well for real time code. You don't write big industrial app in python...I don't think you need a portfolio and most of the time professional experience is valued much more than personal projects. Honestly even as beginner 1-2 internship are much more valuable than any portfolio. Once you have a bit of XP, the XP matters much more.You could almost always find solutions to most problem with the right Google search. Now it is just asking your preferred AI. Learn how to use these tools, really. Sure internal stuff you may have no choice, but in many case the info is just here.Many company will ask you to code something for interview and will ask technical/architectural questions. Train for interviews. Train for the coding exercise and train for architectural question as well as other interviews aspects.Once you are hire, you get a bit more time. But you need to get a foot at the door anyway. If you are not in, everything else is useless.",

Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.The basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the \"main\" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. It gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",

        "body": "I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. Imagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. Your team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. To do that, you check out the single book (My life as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. You do your stuff. Now you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. Of course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. Everyone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. Now instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. It means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. Sometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s such a conflict.Most importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. It may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",

But that was technology where you knew exactly what the hardware was.

You’re trying to train your brain to think in abstractions, understand decomposition, generalization, managing complexity, logic, and structure. That’s what CS is for. That’s what good teaching is for. And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.On the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first. Sometimes it does, with enough reflection. But often, it builds habits that are hard to unlearn later.If you want to learn programming, keep it small, controlled, and concept-driven. Then build up. Progression is the key.",

Ideally you have someone more experienced reviewing your code, but that's going to come more from collaborative work with experienced people, like at a job. Discipline. I know a software project is never technically finished, there's always something new to add, but you should at least be getting projects to a usable state. Like if you were going to release the project as a product, it should do what you set out to do. If you want this to be a career, you need to start seeing things through, even if you don't feel motivated to do it in that moment. Just commit and finish some of these projects.",

It doesn't sound like a \"false passion\" to me, but there's an easy way to find out. Stop. If you can't do that, it's a real passion. If you really want to know, take a break and see if you miss it. Simple test. You may need to include a little more reading code in your cycle. Reading code written by better, more experienced engineers is a good way to understand some of the things you might be doing wrong or ways you could be doing things better. There's plenty on Github. Look for well-known libraries and tools in your chosen stack and just browse the code. You're not trying to understand all of it. Just dive in some place that looks interesting and read through, see how they approach things, style, format, design. Novelists don't become novelists without reading other people's novels. Poets don't become poets without reading other people's poetry and engineers don't become engineers without reading other people's code. Good luck.",

Make a \"negative feature list\", a list of features that the project **won't** have. Remind yourself that a small finished project is better than a dozen large unfinished projects.Also note that my advice is good, but that doesn't mean I always follow it myself.Other practical advice: since you're young and self-taught, I'd also suggest doing a \"DSA\" or \"data structures and algorithms\" course. [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) is good and free. This is a freshmen CS course, but I'd also say that it's like 50% of the usefulness of any CS degree.",

In a lot of real life programming tasks, \"good enough to get the job done\" is more than good enough.

Long commands that we use once likely require consulting a reference and iterating a few attempts, same as programming in general.Code organization is a separate topic. Experience on larger projects helps. Some frameworks nail it down for you and have strong conventions around where things go. Often we're working in a legacy codebase, and we use the organization that's already there, or we might rework it to make it better organized. There are methodologies for how to organize a codebase and some work better than others. Use of packages and modules are widespread for larger projects, but single-file apps exist. Layers are overrated. Verticals are better. Functional core, imperative shell. Try to avoid dependency cycles among modules. Some codebases have a single main that everything flows into, while others have multiple entry points. Culture varies with ecosystem. Python thinks flat is better than nested, but Java likes to nest a lot more.",

The program included all the basics along with some algorithm type stuff like golden ratio Fibonacci sequences and Eulers number.  I didn’t write the program from scratch in one day, what I would do is build onto it daily, I would rewrite what I wrote the day before and then continue on. This really led to the language and syntax type stuff sinking inTutorials can be bad because a big part of programming or just engineering in general is problem solving.  If you are just blindly doing what you are being told to do, you aren’t exercising or practicing this part.  Analytical skills and breaking down complex problems are a big part of this.If you are able to visualize and analyze some sort of issue or problem you are generally interested in and build a program in order to solve it, that is a lot More effective in learning rather than just doing some YouTube step by step “to do list” tutorial.   Anyone can copy something, at this point you are not practicing how to program but rather how to copy a tutorial from YouTube.",

Tutorials are holding your hand so that you don't get lost in kindergarden. > Any advice to stay on track without getting overwhelmed? Follow a curriculum. Find the curriculum of what you want to learn on a university website. Find ressources to learn the topics (if they give the books used for the courses, buy them and study them). Ace the ressources (my goal was to absorb 100% of the content of those ressources. I deemed acceptable if I ended above 90%, with the last 10% me having understood the concept but maybe lacking excellent execution). > without getting overwhelmed? You will get overwhelmed. It's normal. Learn to deal with that. You'll need discipline to stay on schedule (yes, build a schedule for your learning path), and a schedule slow enough so that you can consistently be 1 week ahead in case you stumble onto something difficult that requires 1 full week of research and work to grasp. It will happen. Source: I did self-teach maths, statistics, and a bit of programming up to bachelor level (I think it's that equivalent in the US, 3 years into college), and managed to get accepted in a master's degree. This way I only did 2 years of university to get a master's degree worth on the job market + network from the university. Yes, I'm not fully self-taught, people may dismiss my experience as \"basically not self-taught\" if they want, but at least I'm transparent. Just to add, going the self-taught route is much harder than going the university route. I did that because I couldn't afford to stop working for 5 years to get back into the job market with a decent job and I was super motivated.",

You need to learn by doing projects because projects by definition have an end. Tutorial Hell is like open world games, you can just keep going. 1. What I did was to set myself projects which interested me that we adjacent to the kind of tasks I'd be doing in a job. In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases. Rabbit-holes are great and you should dive into them, but having a project tethers you to what you're trying to achieve and you can drag yourself back because you start to feel guilty that you've not made progress. If your goal is undefined \"I'm going to learn\" that mindset will encourage you to keep going deeper. For example, in my case I spent time working out how to get data into pandas, but I also went down some rabbit-holes of anonymous functions and different file formats which were good to know, but not directly applicable. I didn't get into what's possible to do in numpy because my motivation was to get my project done, not to learn learn learn. 1. Same answer as the other two. \"Do projects.\" 99.9% of programming is going to fall outside of your project's scope, so it naturally limits you to a domain that should be manageable. If it doesn't, then the programming mindset of continually breaking down the problem until you have something you can solve or you can research how to solve it will get you the rest of the way.",

It could only be FreeRTOS like.And to be fair, it's a horrible idea to do this. ESP32 is built on FreeRTOS. Most of the SDKs rely on FreeRTOS. And since BT and WiFi are undocumented binary blobs, you would have to reverse engineer it fully to get support (as a beginner, you wont be able to do this. Even as a professional its question of months). Other than that, I think everything else is fairly okay at documentation. Im sorry, but it seems that your professor has no clue what he is talking about.You might be luckier with STMs (especially the H7 dual cortex ones). But why go down embedded OS way? If something go for plain old x64 or even RPi. This assignment doesn't make sense.If you want to get into embedded, just use STMs or ESPs without that fancy shit. Its hard enough by itself. If you are interested in higher lever low level (like userspace Assembly or OSDev) then just go with your regular x64. Both Linux and Windows works. If you have no clue what you are doing, Windows might be harder for beginners.Edit: the H7 actually doesnt have a dual cortex dev board that's below 300 dollars iirc. Its a shame. Lower end H7s do. I would really appreciate if someone would make one for the higher end H7s that does not have all the fancy things EVAL has.",

The source file is a list of all the calls to the department with a patient ID, telephone number, a short description of the call and some other data. The destination is a very differently formatted excel file with additional fields for patient info which I was supposed to look up in the hospital’s IT system and manually enter. The rest of the data fortunately didn’t have to be edited. I realised that the destination file already has all the patient info in the previous entries (and in fact others were just searching and copying it from the same file) so I did some excel ju-jitsu and made a “program” sheet which would auto-format (28 hidden columns) and automatically fill in patient info any num of rows you copy-pasted directly from the source file. Even with copying patient data from the previous entries, logging 100 calls (2 days worth) usually took about 3-4 hours of mind numbing work, I got that down to about 15 minutes. Being from a non-tech background, I felt like a wizard. We students are paid by the hour though, so even after showing my colleague how much faster she could now do it, she opted to just keep doing it manually to pass the time faster.

The benefits arent speed or even clean apis or anything, the thing you’re trying to do when considering coding paradigms is making good valid abstractions. It’s only for people reading and working with the code. So don’t get too obsessed with this debate and miss the underlying stuff that ur abstractions actually do. It’s the industry standard to code pretty object oriented, and it works fairly well for large projects. Use the right tool for the job, don’t get too obsessed with it. It’s not the only way to code programming imperatively, where state exists but not everything has to be a class that mutates its own state is fine if you do it clean enough. Programming functionally where state is minimized as much as humanly possible to reduce the program to a pipeline of functions is also popular. Really these things are guard rails to keep people from being dumb. Which is valuable for large projects with many devs,oop in the traditional sense is one of the stricter ones.",

What does an application / website that solves this problem need?- A database or file at least to store kitchen inventory- A front end for anyone in the house to use buttons and input data- There are more things. Figure them out as you go.3. How long will it take me to do this and learn this?- Set time limits, goals, checkpoints immediately, because everyone is a procrastinator.You'll need to figure out now that you've dabbled with Python, how to use it as a tool for other things.The world goes anywhere. I'd say that this is where just understanding what a programming language, framework, library and API are, is necessary for you to do more. You want to get a glimpse of what people do with that language.",

I will share withou you what situation I found myself in to better illustrate this.I am building a dashboard that will show some data like system usage, uptime monitoring and some other things. I have a Raspberry Pi with a display set up for this and it will live on my desk so I can quickly reference it if needed.I needed to get the usage data from my PC to the Raspberry Pi and the solution I found was quite simpler than I initially expected: I made a Windows client that just sends data to an API and I configured a webserver on the Pi.I still needed some data from the Windows client to see if any relevant events occur, like loosing connection, getting an error or anything that should happen at runtime I would like to be notified about, maybe a few simple configurations. So I decided to make the application run headless, but having a tray icon. This helped me have a few settings in the tray menu, simple toggles, on and off. For the messages that communicate my client application’s state I chose to use notifications. So like this I have settings and feedback from the application without any actual UI.Of course it is more of a particular case creating a dedicated web server, but I eanted to ilustrate to you that there are some (maybe non-conventional) solutions, other than doing the interface in Python. I have also thought about implementing some logic on the webserver so it could send some data as a response that would trogger some change in the client’s behavios behavior. That would basically move the configuration from the tray menu to the thouchscreen display of the Pi. There are solutions, just think of what is best for your use-case!As for my reasoning, I think Python is more of a backend oriented language. Even though it is possible to do interfaces in Python, I think it is far from ideal.",

No, but it is the only languages (let's ignore wasm for now) that is available in the browser so you have to use it...Why use C# for game development and not Java? Because someone made the application Unity and chose C# as the language to use and Unity was a bloody great application. Yes, C# has stuff that makes it useful for developing games, but it could have been Java.Python is an easy language to pick up and that has of course played a role in it's popularity for AI, but today, since it has become a very common language for AI, all the new libraries need to support Python as well, making it less and less likely that any \"more suitable\" language can take its place.",

If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?I suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in. Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process. You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.I would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development. Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues. You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down. The Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure. I suspect Windows is all C. These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead. There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself. This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.C# and games I have no comments on. My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs \"fast enough\" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",

You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it). You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading. Not a big deal you say? Consider some linear algebra: AX=B. In C++, that could look like B = A\\*X; In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X)); Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain. There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int. Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting. C# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large. Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS). Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away. Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry. Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). So to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else. New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before. Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so. In the 80s and 90s, most people were happy if they could use a word processor without too much work.",

        "body": "You not only need to \"learn programming\". Learning a programming language is like 1% of what you need to learn. The most important aspect you have to acquire is thinking like a dev. Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word \"code\" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it. In your case, you should first find out what you're lacking the most, which will probably be problem solving skills as it is for most devs. If you have not even build a single private project yourself once, it's very unlikely that you're ready to work in a professional development environment in a year. Developing a private project and developing a b2b project as an example are totally different worlds. But thats just my take. Ask 10 devs and all 10 will have different opinions and approaches. The most important question right now which you should ask yourself is \"what exactly do I want to achieve?\".",

        "body": "One thing that can help: If you get stuck on how to do one thing, then just continue. What does this mean? Imagine you try to write an app that opens a window, shows a pink screen, then a special effect and changes to blue. If I'm in a new language first I look at how to write a function in general. Assume we do this in python. So, at this point I only know the function syntax work, what do I do next? def makeItPink(): pass def showEffects(): pass def makeItBlue(): pass def main(): makeItPink() showEffects() makeItBlue() main()Then I thought about it and got to the conclusion \"to make a window pink, how do I get a window first?\"Lookup for frameworks for GUI, choose some one and realize that I should create the window before and pass around the handler in my main, so I modify: def createWindow(): return GuiFramework.Window.new() def main(): handler = createWindow() makeItPink(handler) showEffects(handler) makeItBlue(handler)The idea is that you split what you are trying in the different steps you currently understand that happen in your app, then you try to refine every step one by one. In the process you introduce as many axillary undefined functions as you need. At every step, if you got stuck in something, you leave it as an undefined function and continue with the rest. Eventually you reach a point where no more undefined functions are left except the problematic ones and you focus on them. This doesn't apply for big projects, but people planning big projects learned how to design them by doing things! The most important part of the process is that you move to do things! Otherwise (at this beginner stage you are) you get stuck forever and don't improve!Note: If you are refining your steps and you have to see a tutorial about it, do it. You already understand why you need this step, and would focus on how to do it rather than in why. This means you already overcome one of the principal reasons not to watch a tutorial.",

The LineItem table doesn’t describe the product itself. It represents an economic transaction, and the price it refers to is not the current catalog price, but rather the price snapshot at the time of the sale, specifically referred to that order.In fact, this is exactly where discounts, custom prices, or promotions could apply. Directly in the LineItem. Tying it only to the current Product data breaks the integrity of historical records and assumes that product attributes are timeless, which they clearly aren't.Edit i see many answers with triggers, other tables and so on. If you move redundancy out of a table that should be ,because of semantic, \"denormalized by design\" you are not removing redundancy from DB and you have an inconsistent LineItem table as result.Normalization should not be \"never replicate data, even when it has different meaning\".Normalization is a technical tool that originated because, before ORMs, data persistence was handled directly by application code, which led to all sorts of issues. The idea was to solve these problems by abstracting the physical layer of persistence and using relational algebra rules to optimize the logical design.But normalization must be subordinate to proper modeling of entities and meanings.For example, suppose you have a product_quantity field in a product catalog table, meaning \"units per package\", and another product_quantity field in a warehouse table, meaning \"units in stock\".Should you normalize the schema to avoid redundancy, or disambiguate the semantics first?The answer is obvious: semantics first. Otherwise you're just normalizing confusion.",

I think the important part is to make sure that we learn something from those instances.A few things to note when making your decision:* You can definitely take a break from this and come back later. Even as a resume project no one is going to look at the timestamps of your git history and grill you on it. They will be looking at the finished product.* If the project has grown too frustrating you can definitely choose to walk away from it. There is nothing wrong with finding another project to work on for your resume that won't be nearly as frustrating.",

You want everything right now and without effort. You probably spent more time searching for an effortless solution than just doing simple exercises.## How do you use FPThe answer is simple: if you want to \"edit something\", you create a copie with the new values you want.Imaging doubling the elements in a list. In procedural programming, like C, you would do: ```Cfor(int i = 0; i < myarray.size(); ++i) { myarray[i] = 2 * myarray[i]}```here you are modifying the content of `myarray` in place.If you use a comprehension, then you create a copy of the list```pythondoubledarray = [2 * x for x in myarray]```## Why FP ?FP isn't as popular as procedural/OOP, which is a shame IMO.FP has a lot of benefits, for example, the non-mutability helps the compilers to optimize, you also remove the need for synchronization primitives.But that's all there is to it. FP is also less prone to poorly written code.In procedural, people (not just juniors sadly..) wll just start to code without further thinking and will put `if` here, a `loop` there, now they get the data from the database, .. it becomes a mess hard to follow. This is because they declare \"how\" to do the changes: \"take this value here, change it, reassign it, ..)(Of course, there are coding guidelines like \"short-circuiting\" or \"input-data-output\" flow, but people don't know/respecr them all the time.)Instead of telling the computer \"how\" to do it, just tell it what you want: \"double the values in the list\".I always make the junior do a bit of FP when they start, this helps them take good habits",

        "body": "I see you have problems understanding the lack of mutability, let me try to help. First, conceptually.Since there's no mutability, if you have a state in your app, you need to explicitly pass it around. In the most basic way your functions would have a type like this doSomethingWithState:: BoardState -> (BoardState, a)This means, I took the old state of the app, then I generated a new state with the modifications I want, and a value related to whatever this function did. If all your functions have a type like that (accepting a state and retrieving one state with modifications) then all what you have to do to \"update\" a state, is to propagate to the functions the new state. If you think about it imperatively, you may get the sensation that they are wasting a lot of memory cloning the state. The truth is that a compiler would try to optimize this to mutate in place. What? Think about it, the compiler may see (in this imperative pseudo python code) def something(state): (newState, value1)= doSomething1(state) (newNewState, value2) = doSomething2(newState) return newNewStateAs long as value1 doesnt refer to something inside newState, the compiler can see that you used the `newState` only to pass as argument and is never refer again. So it can generate code that performs updates on newState to generate newState2. The compiler may choose to do this optimization or not. That's what it means that is declarative. You stated your desire to transmit the state of the app, the compiler chooses if it would remain inmutable, or not. You stated what the final effect is and the compiler filled the details. One example where mutability is nice: If you are parsing a string s, you want to try to parse something and restore the state if it fails, without immutability you need to explicitly clone the state before trying and restore it manually it after. With immutability you only need to use the old state that is still available. About nested loops, you use recursive function, you need to capture all the variables you are regularly mutating in your imperative loop. You put all of them in a state and that's what you pass around in your recursive calls, a state modified by your recursive function. def loop(state): (s2,a) = something(state) print(a) return loop(s2) def main(): state = makeInitialState() (endState,a)=loop(state) return aA more concrete example: def sumToNImperative(n): acc =0 for j in range(n): acc+=j return acc def sumToNPure(n): return sumToNPureAux(n,0) def sumToNPureAux(n,acc): if n>0: return sumToNPureAux(n-1, acc+1) else: return acc The nice thing is that with TCO the pure version can be compiled to the equivalent for loop. Again, the optimization can or cannot happen. That depends on the compiler chooses.",

A function can read its input, and spit out something new, but it can’t touch the original data. And since you can’t modify any data, you can’t really use iterators like you usually do. You can still walk through items in a list, but instead of enumerating what your current index is, you’re simply stepping to the next item until there’s none left, applying a function to each item, and appending the result to a new list. So `result = [x*2 for x in list]` is python syntactical sugar for ``` Result = []for x in list: Result.append(x*2)```Instead of telling the computer “find the item at i index in this array, then do x to it”, you’re saying “give me the output of this function for every item in this list.”Hope this helpsEta: I think a lot of these concepts are easier to understand if you’re actively using recursion instead of loops.",

Don't focus on \"I need to learn backend\" or \"I need to learn frontend\", focus on rather, I have idea **A**, which needs features X, Y and Z, and I need to figure out how to build them. Pick the right tutorial's, blogs and lessons that will help you implement the features you want. Soon or later it will all come together and you will naturally fill in the knowledge gaps when building something you actually want. Plus it's fun. Fundamental's are important don't overlook them. But have fun, break problems down to their core, figure out how to solve them and what knowledge you need to get them done. I believe learning something for the sake of learning is often, a huge waste of time. You need to (if you can) have clear intentions and set clear goals, that way a solution to \"you feeling lost\" is just a simple to-do list of the things you need to get done. Good luck!",

Do i need frontend?\"If your real goal is to work in AI, then picking up Django or diving into backend/frontend development might not be the right first move unless you're doing it just to get a job quickly. Let's try to untangle one of the most common knots. Stack accumulation is not directly related to CS learning process. So learning Django doesn't teach you software engineering, and \"learning backend\" doesn't automatically make you good at building systems or understanding how AI works. It just makes you... someone who knows Django.Stack accumulation is something needed AFTER you formed yourself, understood what you need and you're asking yourself \"what are the best, most common, tools we can use toward this?\"Or if you want to become job ready on a specific path, pretty fast.But If you're serious about AI, you'd get way more value starting from the actual foundations: data, computation, algorithms, programming principles. Learn how software works, not just how to wire things together. Then, when you build something related to AI, you’ll know how and why it works. And how to improve it.TLDR, before picking stacks, pick a direction that teaches you how to think like a builder, not just how to glue tools together. Because 6 months of python... well.... you're not quite there yet. I'm not trying to deny the effort or saying it doesn't count, it does. I'm trying to say you just started your path, do not rush if rushing isn't needed.",

Take your time to learn the fundamentals thoroughly - really make sure you've got your understanding of *programming* in general solid before you worry too much about specific frameworks or technologies or whatever. Build up your understanding gradually from the ground up.Like if you want to get good at frontend - before even touching a framework, learn how HTML and CSS works. Learn about the DOM. Figure out what all is going on and how you'd do it *yourself* and only then when you've got a decent idea of how it works should you move onto a framework to save yourself some work.",

You need some sort of vision or goal to work towards.I guess you should definitely get confortable with Git, it's pretty widespread across all industries I can think of. Beyond that, I'd advise always working on the fundamentals of computing: how a computer works, low level languages... IMO you can't go wrong with that even if you end up working with really high level languages, because you'll always have an understanding that, at the end of the day, it's all 1s ans 0s (*back in my father's day they sometimes didn't even have 1s ! /s*).",

You should be doing something *every* summer, whether that be gaining new skills or doing an internship.With the current tech industry right now, if you can create a full-stack project and implement GenAI in there, your resume and experience will be **golden (especially as a 3rd year CS major)**. You have HTML and CSS locked in, JavaScript is definitely the next step.Here is a full-stack course that will teach you full-stack development from day one: [https://fullstackopen.com/en/about](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) . This course is definitely doable in 3 months with about 2-4 hours a day.If you are more into low-level coding/embedded systems and would prefer not to step into full-stack engineering, work on some of these low-level coding projects: [https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)If data-science and machine learning are your thing, here is another reference/guide on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g6d4cz/roadmap\\_to\\_becoming\\_an\\_ai\\_engineer\\_in\\_8\\_to\\_12/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g6d4cz/roadmap_to_becoming_an_ai_engineer_in_8_to_12/) . Also check out Kaggle.And since your algorithms skills are weak, brush up on DSA with LeetCode. Trust me, it's not as scary once you practice. All computer science really takes is practice. Make sure to lock in on a specialty during the summer so you aren't bouncing around half-learning a lot of things (my major pitfall). Do at least one problem a day to start.Beyond this, your 3rd-4th year transition summer is crucial to get an internship. And doing these projects will for sure help you land one. Edit: typos",

They don’t have to be something crazy; just something to showcase your skills. There’s plenty of suggestions out there for project ideas, but I suggest just thinking of a problem you have and make something that solves or helps with that problem. That’ll stand out way more to a recruiter rather than them seeing their 500th To-Do app for the day.For resources: YouTube and AI. There is a wide variety of good channels out there and AI can help you with more specific questions.Above all though, don’t forget to enjoy your summer. I’m not saying to not do anything because the job market is ass right now so the more prepared you are for it the better, but don’t lock yourself up all day and night coding nonstop.

At 27, I decide to go full into IT, I plan to go into Data Analysis role. I join intense course for PCEP (Python cert), but couldn't land DA role. I just took a graduate assistantship at university helping lecturers to do Data processing for ML research. During the assistantship,, I attended part time webdev bootcamp, not actually interested in webdev, I just wnat to network with IT people so I can land proper IT job. After my assistantship contract ended, I joined UX reskill bootcamp under government program that helps retrennched workers. I managed to get myfirst dev role due to their on the Job training program. The company I'm training at didnt proceed to hire me, but I managed to land a laravel role at other company. This is my current role I have just started in 5 months. You definitely can go into tech, but it's going to be really fucking hard, and understand that your arsenal aren't as good as other candidates because we come from different academic discipline. Getting through HR is the toughest, I advise you to get some certs just so it can convince them. I'd prefer to go for known certs like COMPTIA, cisco, Python Institute because HR might recognise these names, compared to udemy and LinkedIn learning. Definitely make a good project you can be proud of. It's easier to show the technical managers what you have built than just yapping about it. In my experience, everyone in the webdev bootcamp I have attended, knows that personal projects are crucial to land a job, but most end up not building anything either way.Also, I think Python is agood starting point, but if I were you, I'd pick a niche on top of python. For example build an API server using python, or build an automation script using python. That way, if you got offer for role that's not related to python, you can still explain the technology and mechanisms, even though they are using different programming language. I know I'm still very junior, but I'm sharing this to paint the picture of the path you may experience as a career shifter. It may be easier for you, or it may be harder. Good luck!",

At university you got probably got two different subjects like analysis and design just to understand this all.So, you want to create a blackjack game? Then imagine how it is played in real life, you have a deck made of cards, you have a dealer, you have one or more players, players ask for cards (or the dealer draws cards), they bet, and the one closer to 21 points wins. Write down in text the interactions, like \"the dealer shuffles two, three, four decks of cards\", \"the dealer deals one card to every player\", \"the players bet\", etc, etc, and then find the nouns and the verbs. Nouns are potential classes (player, dealer, card, deck, bet, etc) whereas verbs are potential methods (deal, bet, withdraw, etc). Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the \"protocol\" between them, which \"messages\" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which \"messages\" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.Maybe you should begin with simpler designs? Like create a File class that lets you work with files? Create a Calculator class that lets you execute math operations? That might help.",

Be dumb.If that means rarely or never using 95% of what OOP has offer, then **that's the right way to do it**!Don't use inheritance at all, unless you know it's going to save you a LOT of typing. And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.Don't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods. They're mainly helpful when you code yourself into a corner and don't want to redo large bits, so don't use them in the beginning.Don't try to organize your code according to the typical OOP tutorials. It never works. Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.If you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.Use OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.Try to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your \"nouns\" and \"verbs\", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.Be perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.\"The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle\" - someone else's quote.OOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.Consider this: goto and global variables exist too.Write a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it. That's it.",

And I jump in to force the task to end (so I take controls and show them how we finish this). But at this point, I can't take the time to let them in control and me helping them \"getting it\". What I should be doing if they accepted my help before. My role, at least a big part of it.At some point they were frustrated because our pairing session was just me showing off...So I stated as an objective that they have to talk to me often about what is blocking them. They also have to accept help when I offer it. They choose when, but they have to accept or else, I'll be taking the task if they can't handle it and everyone is frustrated. And they shoot themselves in the foot. So my main idea is:It's cool to want to get things on your own. But you are given help to be able to do more than that. So please use that. Use your mates whatever the level, raise warning about your blockers, communicate.You can get things on your own, on your own time... That's a bit harsh, but the project needs to move forward. Else, you'll be ejected from the project.It's more important to raise warning, that's team play. You're not alone in this, you shouldn't at least (I may have missed something in your post).Edit: to answer the part where the team doesn't answer fast enough. Tell your manager and insist.

Ask for help earlier and raise warnings faster (like, metacognitively, learn to recognize when you're being a perfectionist stubborn person; learn those patterns in your own process and learn to recognize when it's happening). What you're describing is a great way to develop mastery and delve deeply into topics and subjects that interest you. But it's also not right to do that at the expense of your coworkers' sanity and time and the money of your employers. Does that make sense? Do side projects, keep that perfectionist-mastery side of you alive through those. But sometimes at work you just need to do the things and the stuff and that's ok too.

There are several alleys towards unblocking and you must timebox your attempts, not fall for sunk cost fallacy, reassess the problem, rubber duck yours, others and even 3rd party code, ask for help, ask for clarifications, break down the problem into known facts, stash/shelve your changes and start over, or my favorite: do something else and come back to the problem later.Remember: the only thing that can solve a problem is a solution to it, and debugging for months isn't a solution, it may help identify the problem but that depends how you go about it. You are also not responsible for all the overlying causes to blockers, so if it tends to happen over and over in the same code base maybe it's the code base and not you (as a senior dev I've found that the faster I assess that the code base stinks, the faster I deal with blockers).There are resources online that tackle this very part of software development and with science and practice you'll unblock yourself much faster and you won't feel blocked that many times.",

If you have to really stop and read it, or read it a few times to understand what it does, then your code is not readable.* If you would read it in about a year of not touching this code, would you understand easily what it does? It's easy to read it when you know all the context and all the considerations that are part of it, but you will eventually forget it. What happens then?* Is it easy to understand *why* something a code does something? For example, you do an if check for a specific value. Is the *reason* why we do this value clear? If it's not clear, then a comment should explain it.* Is the code efficient? No need to over-optimize, but we can at least not repeat things that don't need to be repeated. For example, if you need to fetch something that doesn't change during your flow, fetch it once and use it for all relevant operations, rather than fetching it over and over. Same can be said for complex calculations.* Is the code going to external APIs too often? Most APIs are rate limited, and you don't want to overdo it in order to prevent being blocked. Even if a single flow works, what happens if the flow is invoked a few times by multiple users? Some APIs also charge you for each API use, so you want to keep costs down.* Is the context of a flow clear? For example, say a user updates their details and clicks \"Save\". Is it easy to know what user triggered this flow, when, and how? How do you know you're not accidentally saving over the wrong user's data?* Logs and tests: this is for the real world rather for academic tests, but good to keep in mind. Are there useful logs placed in strategic locations in the code to make it easy to follow along a log trail if something goes wrong? Are there tests to make sure that your flow works?Following those points will make sure your code is in at least in a pretty good condition. Of course, the above questions are subjective, but you should be able to answer them for yourself.",

You could probably handle simple backend work within 2-3 weeks with consistent effort.As for learning resources, check out FreeCodeCamp for SQL basics and Flask Docs for Python backend. If you’re looking for quick tutorials, Traversy Media on YouTube has great content for both SQL and backend development.

Python dominates the market at the moment despite slow af, just because it's simple enough and there are many libraries. My suggestion is to look at Clojure/Clojurescript, as they would give the most benefits for someone without any experience right now. The reason being Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. This way, you have the best of many worlds in one, you would have all the libraries of the Java ecosystem helping you. You then can use Clojure, which is a Lisp and is excellent for functional and meta programming, and Clojurescript compiled down to Javascript so you'll be able to leverage the webs too. (Without the need to master Javascript or Typescript, besides Clojure is much more flexible and powerful than both Javascript and Typescript)Another perk is that Clojure compiled down to Java also, so if you want to target the mobile phone too, it'll be a nice perk. Clojure's flexibility, capability and expressiveness will amaze you and ruin your taste for clunky languages.",

        "body": "The general direction I’d suggest, especially if you’re in 12th grade and thinking long-term about building a startup, is to build a strong foundation across three types of programming tools, each opens up a different way of thinking and building: # A. A systems-level language (C, C++, or Rust)These aren’t beginner-friendly, but even a little exposure helps you understand how computers *really* work, memory, runtime, compilation. Rust is a good modern choice, safe, powerful, and increasingly relevant.# B. A general-purpose language with a rich ecosystemThis is where you’ll probably spend the most time. **Python** is a great choice here, simple syntax, huge ecosystem, and good for scripting, data, and automation. Alternatively, **JavaScript/TypeScript** is indispensable if you want to build anything for the web. # C. A language that stretches your thinkingIf you’re feeling curious, try a functional language like **Clojure**, **Scheme**, or **Haskell** later on. They’ll stretch your brain in all the right ways, especially around immutability and design. # On the tech startup sideIf you're dreaming of launching a product, the key thing is to **learn by building**. Tutorials are fine, but try to solve your own problems. Build a notes app. Build a tiny CMS. Build a budget tracker for your classmates.You’ll learn programming, but also:* What users care about (hint: not your code), * How to debug weird production issues, * What \"simple\" really means when you’re maintaining something alone. And along the way, don’t ignore the command line, basic Git, and Linux tooling. Those aren't trendy, but they’ll save you countless hours.When I started working on what eventually became my own startup, the early tech choices weren’t dictated by popularity or benchmarks; they were guided by how fast I could test ideas and how well I understood the tools I was using. In hindsight, it was less about choosing the \"right stack\" and more about building the muscle to iterate quickly, keep things maintainable, and stay curious.",

They treated me like a god for a while after.Then a few months later I found out that while other departments used to use the same data, the team I interacted with was the only one that still used it. So we could've done what I suggested.Anyway, I don't know what became of those people whose primary job was manually manipulating those CSV files because I left not too long after my contract ended.",

They used this crazy nested loops and nested if else constructs and an array. It did not implement the desired logic precisely so it kept running into cases it didn't acct for. Anyway i rewrote that whole thing and used a map map set. Now for a tiny bit of extra memory we don't have to worry about missing cases cause the desired logic is exact for each scenario without having to handle individual scenarios. It also runs twice as fast but this was not really a concern. The logic being proper according to specs is the real change. I should never see this issue again. New cases should have no impact now and be processed precisely. Another item was a batch job that have 15 if else blocks to run the same logic on 15 different string builders. Rewrote that to reuse 1 string builder and remove all the if else blocks using a bucketing approach and while loop. Now the records can expand as much as needed without issue. Used to be every time data grew someone would add another if else.",

I suggested printing to pdf and sending the pdfs to whoever needs them, but I was told by management that \"auditors will never accept pdf statements, they're too easily faked\". For context, these account statements were incredibly simple in formatting, no watermarks or anything like that... you could fake one in under 10 minutes with Word. I do wonder how those managers are coping in 2025...

Same with audio.But with text, I can spot what I need almost instantly, even more if I've already read it.Videos and audios are cool for another type of retention. Letting me become absorbed by the content as if it was a movie, helps me retain more information, but it's different.When I'm reading documentation, the wiki allows me to keep searching between hyperlinks. I can resolve doubts in the flow, as I enter \"the zone\".However videos doesn't let me do that. Yes, I can pause it and look for it, but interrupts the flow.For videos or audios to mimic a fraction of the Wiki's power, it has to be a well constructed and have a great pacing, wich nowadays is rare.Short videos are also good, but for short super specific things.",

Forcing yourself to learn things you don’t want(disinterests you, not necessarily because it’s hard) just burns you out. Learn things your pace. If you feel like you’re not learning much, I recommend reading up different sort of technologies and forming up your own projects. These projects can then later on help you out on resumes and portfolios if you plan on landing a job in Computer Science. Especially if you work on projects that focus on real-life implementation(i.e command line version of a messenger app, allows for long distance communication and can be made using python’s socket module)All in all, you shouldn’t force yourself to stick to one language. Nobody does, in fact, you’re discouraged from doing so. The more things you learn, the more you can say about yourself and the better you can express yourself. Even the concepts you might learn in other languages or technologies can carry into the other technologies and languages you have already learnt.

And the \"learning\" dissipates as soon as you leave the course (or get up for a coffee).But they aren't a complete waste of time, they do introduce you to syntax and principles, one small step at a time. What you need to do, is to ALSO build some sort of project, or small code-exercises for yourself. After having been through for-loop exercises, invent your own, decide that you want a loop that goes backwards, or skips every third number, or doubles every time. Small things. Then decide if you have some simple project-ideas you can build with what you have learnt - ask your self if something interesting can be made with if-statements and loops!So it isn't either or, but also do a project!",

It really depends what your end goal is.Python is good for if you want a career in data science, algorithms, machine learning, and some pretty high level stuff.Java is good for software engineering or architect, QA (Quality Assurance), web development, etc.C, I'm not entirely sure because I've never even touched it yet.C++ is good for high performance systems and applications and embedded systems like medical services and equipment as well as any day to day stuff you use like your smartwatch, your car's tablet thingy idk what it's called, and much more.It's also an excellent choice for if you want to go the game dev route and learn Unreal Engine.In the end, it really comes down to your end goals. While the most programming languages can do the same things as another language can, one is usually better and more efficient at doing so. What do you want to do or be when it comes learning programming? And do you want this to be a real career? If that's the case, then you really need to consider your goals. Hope this answer at least helps and I'm open to being corrected on some stuff I just said. Best of luck, mate.",

A full-stack developer is expected to be able to build an entire modern application from the ground up on their own, more or less. I'm not sure if it's really a choice you should be making as a freshman? Like, as a student you should be learning a little bit about all of these things ANYWAYS and you should be constructing small projects from the ground up to get your feet under you, but I think that level of specialization (or, in the case of a full-stack developer, that profound committment to not specializing) is something you don't really settle in to until you're a bit more experienced?",

I've heard that Indian universities (at least some of them) have a more practical curriculum than those in, say, the US. They are more likely to cover specific technologies (say, Spring, or some web framework).In any case, \"good choice\" is subjective. It's certainly popular. You're not going to get one answer, so you'll have to decide among many answers. For example, someone could say there's a lack of young Cobol programmers and despite fewer jobs being in Cobol, they exist, and are mostly by older programmers that may retire soon.Is that a good choice? Most would say no, but maybe? There's less competition, but that could mean fewer opportunities as well.Given its popularity, it's probably not a bad choice, provided you're willing to do other things.Other choices, which may or may not be available to you are data science, machine learning, but they do require more math (e.g., statistics).",

So, in general, in real-world software, multithreading should be your last choice, not your first. There are other choices. To give you an overview of some other choices, read this (from the Kotlin programming language): https://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html Anyway, while we're talking about other choices, the Go programming language offers Goroutines. I think the Kotlin programming language also offers some sort of Coroutine type functionality. The Scala programming language offers The Actor Model in the form of Akka (you can search for \"Scala Akka\" or \"actor programming model\" for more information). Akka can also be used with recent versions of the Java programming language even though it was written in Scala (both Java and Scala run on the JVM). Microsoft and C# ported Akka over to their platform with Akka.NET . The Erlang programming language has its own implementation of the actor model which I assume is sort of similar to Akka. Also, a lot of programming languages (like Kotlin, Scala, and Haskell) offer some sort of parallel immutable data structures with built-in automatic multithreading. Oh, and in a lot of cases programming languages use async callbacks/promises, like JavaScript. C# has its own async keyword and await keyword for that purpose. The Scala programming language has its own implementation of Futures, which facilitates multithreading and asynchronous programming and is sort of like JavaScript callbacks/promises. Kotlin has a suspend keyword and libraries for working with that sort of asynchronous stuff.But yeah, in real world software, low-level multithreading should be your last resort, not your first.",

This is different in Rust, where suddenly changing to a multithreaded implementation will simply result in the compiler refusing to build the code until you fix everything, and this is also one of the reasons why I wonder why people are still choosing to start new projects in C++ these days.Regarding your specific problem, if you decide to listen to my advice and reimplement everything from scratch, I recommend looking up the Entity Component System architecture, which would greatly benefit your project, minimize potential threading problems (or completely eliminate them in the case of Rust), and maximize both CPU cache efficiency and thread parallelization. In Rust there's a project called Bevy which is a highly modular game engine implementing the aforementioned architecture, however I do not recommend relying on frameworks and libraries while learning.",

Whether or not it is a *good* solution is beside the point: the idea is to gain practice using *reasoning and problem solving skills,* so that it feels familiar and not foreign when you encounter a problem you *can't* easily Google.Having said all of that... Set a time limit for how long you'll work on your own, versus looking up common solutions. Something like 2 hours seems like a good ballpark, but feel free to adjust that based on your own experience.It's good to get in the *habit* of thinking about the problem more deeply before mindlessly reaching or Google, but as you've *also* probably realized, there's often a super simple intended solution to most basic software engineering problems like this one. I would say that learning to reason about software is a *more important* aspect than just rote memorization of common strategies / patterns... But they all really build off of and re-enforce each other. If you learn the common patterns, you can move on to solving *bigger, more complicated problems,* rather than trying to re-invent the wheel from scratch every time.Tl;Dr - Give yourself some time to *practice* thinking about how to solve a problem, but also set a time limit after which you'll \"just Google it\". There's real value is practicing reasoning about code, but you also don't want to get stuck too deeply on \"solving\" trivial problems that have already been solved.",

Something more like `{ name: { \"phone\": phone, \"email\": email } }` assuming you only ever need to look people up by name. Why? Because the email and phone are two independent pieces of information about the same person. There's no reason for the phone to be the key and the email to be the value of a nested dict, that just makes it harder to look it up. Here, they are separate dictionary entries with relevantly-named keys.",

If you’re looking for something more in-depth, \"Learning Python\" by Mark Lutz is a classic and covers all the fundamentals. Lastly, if you’re into data science, \"Python for Data Analysis\" by Wes McKinney is a must-read :bar_chart:. These books will keep you engaged and help you apply what you learn.

Doing this will help you to not only write code, but to also better read and understand code.Also don't block copy and paste code from some other source. It is ok to use another source for parts of your code, but make sure you type that code in by hand. The process of typing in the code will help you to retain knowledge.",

I highly doubt it, unless it's a very niche situation like that one.I mostly use VS Code, by the way, because for my workflows that's the fastest and most efficient, and it has extensions for all the tools I need.

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).That said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.Overall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast. Editing code, refactoring code, and navigating between functions, files, and folders will be instant. But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.I'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically \"not faster than me at all\" or they're something like \"10% faster than me at best\". There's always the rare exception, the sweaty nerd who's so good at Vim that they're flying through code and edits at light speed, but they're rare, and I'd suggest that \"it has more to do with them\" than it does \"Vim\". They're SPECIAL, let's say.",

Motivation can make a big difference. But in general, it isn't necessarily an easy career to get into, and while it is well-paid once you get in it isn't easy money either. Very much like being an engineer or an architect. If you've got the aptitude, it is a solid career, but it isn't worth pursing \"just to get a job\" type of a thing.If you're just looking for a job to improve your financial stituation, you might want to consider jobs that are a little less competitive, require a bit less learning, but still pay well. Everyone says \"HVAC technician\" but I don't know how true that actually is. I've got a bunch of family members who are electricians though, and they've always done pretty well. If you can handle bodily fluids, nursing is always in demand. I think the best balance between job security and decent pay is to get into a field that requires both brains and physical presence on site - needing to do some schooling to get in filters out the applicant pool some and drives wages up, but needing to actually be there to work with your hands/body means you're way less vulnerable to automation or being off-shored.",

What does a falling ball do?* A ball has a position *and a velocity** that velocity starts at zero* downwards velocity increases over time* when colliding with a plane, that velocity is reflected perpendicularly to the plane (possibly with some loss)What you've got is like a motionless ball that repeatedly teleports since you don't have any velocity information. Add a velocity value to the ball, update the velocity over time, reflect it when you detect a collision, and use the velocity to update the position.",

But that’s a really important part of learning to code. Figuring out those issues and finding out how to improve on your own work is worth 10x more than blankly following a guide online that walks you through every step. Normally I’d say plan everything in advance and detail as much as possible before you start but there’s gonna be a lot you don’t know you need yet. Make some plans on how you want it to look, what options you want on each page and title pages. List what your classes will definitely have in them, a User has name, DOB, email, *password(you’ll need to consider how this one is stored and verified differently)Maybe keep answers in the same order to start and randomise them after you get it working. Might be easier for debugging later, how are you going to tell it’s the right answer (probably an answer class with a Boolean variable). Make smaller examples of what you want as you go. Focus on the individual activity first like asking the user a question and getting an answer. After you can go back and add a progress tracker in the cornerUltimately go for it!!! Best way to learn is by doing. If you have something you really like and want to make it’ll be more fun to learn and keep going. Best of luck!!",

I've done the C#/Unity stuff in the past and it was very useful.I think as far as indie games go you will find a lot more resources for Unity, at this point its endless as far as tutorials, courses, discussions, etc. but if you prefer C++ then I guess that's that. Unreal obviously has a big community but I do find that a lot of that is people using blueprints/visual coding/whatever, and a bit more skewed towards different types of games. Coding your own engine could be fun, depending on your goals, but if your goal is to make indie games I wouldn't overcomplicate it - just pick an engine and roll with it - it's hard enough when the engine is already taken care of. :)",

Linux uses .elf, MacOS uses Mach-O, Windows uses PE ( I might be referencing old info here ).An executable and linkable format usually contains 3 possible forms:1. An end executable, which is an object file that has been linked, and it holds several things, like .code section, .data section, can also hold dynamic data if it links against a dynamic lib.2. An archive or static library, which is an agglomerate of object files, that are solely meant to be used as files to be linked against during compile time.3. A dynamic library, which is an object file, with a special format, that allows it to be placed on some part of the memory, and allows any program to link against it during load time.How does the overall loading process occur? Well it's actually quite expensive and full of things. It contains things like creating a new process for the executable, then mapping the correct memory for that executable, placing MMU restrictions, linking against a dynamic library if the executable requires it, and many other things. I've never actually worked directly with loaders, so can't tell you for sure, but I am 100% sure it's doing all of these things, and probably even more.",

I doubt it would work on any arbitrary exe.Unless the process of pyinstaller is 100% reversible, you're likely not looking at exactly the original source code, just something that's probably functionality equivalent. You'd have to look into specifics of both pyinstaller and the extractor library to know more. Much of what you're seeing is probably not used on your specific machine, maybe there for compatibility purposes. If you can get the actual project source code access that would be better.

I can just send you the .exe and we’re both smiling and getting our work done instead of screwing around with language installers. To Windows, a .exe file contains some machine code and some assets, like icons and so forth. The machine code in this .exe was written by the developer of pyInstaller, and the assets are the python stuff you found. The machine code unpacks the assets and starts the python program.Wouldn’t it be cool if you could package, I dunno, a highway bridge in a box, deliver it to the site, and push a button on the box?

        "body": ">You are much more likely to succeed if you make something good. Whether or not you spend two years on it is a risk and you should be getting feedback all along the way. I spent four years on my first big project and enjoyed some success after that.Not sure I agree with this. I know plenty of good things that have failed and plenty of crappy things succeed(Home Advisor). There's the old quote from Ford, \"If I asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\"I am getting constant negative feedback on my BIG personal project and that only gives me more commitment to the cause and it will take years to complete. I can see the Matrix and I know they're wrong. 100% wrong in every way. They just don't see what I see. And my idea isn't unique just very rare and I've seen it in action. The businessman I'm taking it from has made five $100,000,000 businesses from it, and one of them trades on the NYSE.My few month projects are to fill in gaps I see in the SMB space. Like an inventory app. Inventory is relatively easy. There are very few platforms that do JUST inventory. Usually its bundled with with custom scanners and printers and a POS system, or an MRP/ERP, or some other PM suite. Excel is a half measure here. Or a PTO tracker, which is ALWAYS bundled with an HR suite. Payroll drives so much of SMB software decisions and every system is missing something.>How many businesses are you dealing with? With my first and only B2B, the first contract took weeks to negotiate. It was arduous and I had to get lawyers involved. The whole thing was so much more intense than I was imagining. Key man clauses and such.Right now 1 active client, but that is intentional. I'm working through a 2-3 year project with an open ended contract. And they aren't involved in the project I mentioned above. Always use lawyers because they will.>But you're talking about B2B, not trivial nonsense. I would love to know more about how you sell confidence to businesses. I found that to be the hardest thing. They loved the product, but were worried about it being a small operation.Businesses spend more money on trivial shit than people do by a LOT. I was able to save the current business I'm working with about $175k annually over the last year and half by pruning their trivial shit. They were paying an MSP to \"manage\" their cable modem. $500 a month for 10 years. The MSP came out 3 times in 10 years to watch a cable tech swap out the modem for $500 a month.I can say the first thing you shouldn't do is say to the customer that they are your first. You can't show the emotion you might not realize you're showing. You have to show them you're willing and able to walk out of the meeting at any time.\"I don't discuss my existing client business with others. But, let's just say that I was provided the opportunity to explore this entrepreneurial endeavor with some assurances and I'm not concerned at all about the solvency of my business in the short or long term.If you have concerns about bandwidth, I have existing and on-going business relationships with several established firms and individuals that exist inside and outside this country. Due to the range of unique requests I get from my clients that require specialized expertise the expense of a subcontractor is no different than the cost of burden to staff my own business. With my approach I get to leverage the different expertise of each firm rather than to be locked into a few skillsets. In addition to all of that, my business structure gives me the ability to scale based on project requirements without having to resort to end of project layoffs.Of course I am continuing to internally contract a few very qualified persons for a premium, but I am fortunate enough to have the luxury to take my time and cherry pick the right people. Typically these are not customer facing engineers unless the project requirements demand face-to-face or on-site time. I will be your point of contact, and available to contact 24/7. I'm not looking to be the next Facebook, I'm looking to establish a few quality business relationships that will last for years, ideally until I retire and pass the business on to my successor.I understand if this dynamic doesn't appeal to you. Not every contractor is for every client, and the last thing I want is to enter a business relationship where one side is unhappy. This is an interview for me as well as an interview for you.\"Take that and make it yours. Make it the first time...every time!",

In a sense it can feel like web programming: you have a separate markup file and event listeners.You can also target OS-native APIs from C++, C#, or Swift if you want to build apps for specific platforms only.And there are many other widget libraries, either language-specific (like Glimmer for Ruby) or cross-language, like wxWidgets or GTK. There are many-many choices and also many libraries that wrap other libraries. Like, with wxWidgets in order to target Linux you can use wxGTK or wxQt, and similar things exist for other platforms.I would first decide whether cross-platform support is a must, and then pick a language and look for options for that specific language.",

        "body": "Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:**Start with a clear theme**They rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.**Component architecture: two clear categories**- Templates:These are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.- Traditional components:These do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. - **Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**Most components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.**Type safety everywhere**They use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.Types are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.**Always validate backend data**First thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early. If something is wrong, I’d rather have it fail immediately than cause weird bugs later.",

If I use a central state store I’ll usually use a [react context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext), data will typically be read by each component via a useContext hook.If a component needs to change the state, it will [dispatch](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) an action to the reducer to modify the data in the context.These are just some ways to do things. They are by no means must do, and there are many ways to do the thing.For example, like I mentioned before, zustand signals can be a great way to handle small states.Does that answer your question?",

It's a Pearson textbook which i consider to be some of the best quality around. They've been around long enough and are on the 13th edition or so. They used to do no code, just pseudo but they've changed in the very recent editions to be Python since people may as well get exposure to it while they talk about the broader CS topics, but the focus is those topics.It covers computer architecture, Operating Systems, software dev lifecycle, databases, paradigms, AI, graphics, data abstractions and data structures and everything from floating point numbers to file compression. It's fantastic for the fundamentals. There's almost no math in it though which is a bonus or a hindrance depending on what you're looking for.",

You should be able to pick up the basics of the topics in about 5 hours a week. Learning to apply them takes practice- I don’t know how you learn, so it’s difficult to say how long that will take. I target the ability to break down a problem in a few hours and come up with a structured plan to code your application as a good way to judge when you’re there.Game vs web? Your call. Both markets are somewhat saturated at the moment. You may need a little more graphic design background for good looking websites. Basically, do what makes you more passionate about it. That will be a lasting solution. I’d spend a couple hours a night after dinner working on the structure stuff until it’s natural to do it with a problem. Then start your coding practice and make something like a tic-tac-toe game from scratch WITH WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION. The prose is an important part. My 2 cents worth. YMMV.",

Ultimately, you’re navigating in an ocean of things to learn and grow from whichever path you take and it will be hard, so do what is going to keep you paddling. 3. This is a really hard question to answer. The less you know, the harder it is to practice because you get road blocked so often. We also don’t know your schedule. I work 8 hours a day - sometimes more. If I wasn’t getting paid I would tap out a lot sooner though. What always kept me on track were Udemy courses. Being able to chip away at classes, making sure I was doing a little bit every day helped. Also doing a degree helps, gives you lots of time, support, motivations and resources to learn. Nobody can say how long it’s going to take you to be job ready. That said, if I had to guess I can see a lot of smart people being job ready in a year if they did like 2-3 hours a day of focused study?",

Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control. With games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true. Typically the lag will come from one player not verifying the previous simulation slice fast enough.",

Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.Lets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",

No point in seeing 60fps in what's essentially a paused game.",

It might not be as glamorous as what you see on here but it will come. 145 in two days is kinda crazy but I like the hustle. Here's what I would do instead tho, stop tweaking the resume. Instead make two, say one that focuses on whatever your strengths are(if your internships were more backend or data whatever) and the other more general jack of all trades. Try your best to schedule out your job searches. Meaning, you spent x hours applying then stop. You're already burning yourself out and it isn't working. Spend the rest of the time upskilling and working on projects. Build shit for fun or profit doesn't matter really, just keep learning.",

So what’s going on?Job seekers are applying to jobs in extreme excess. This completely clocks the ATS systems and HR. You have thousands of applications for positions. Many aren’t qualified. And some of very well qualified.Well, the very well qualified people get reviewed and are the first called. But often times; they weren’t even interested in the job but the ease of applying made them keep their feelers open. So jobs get bombarded with all sorts of applicants. And we’ve hit a bottleneck. There’s a large pool of applicants and the corporate team wants the absolute best. You get looked over for the top 10% of applicants. And the top 10% of applicants are probably looking for employment elsewhere.",

Two different managers. Once made my life annoying and another manager made my life great, while simultaneously getting me promoted.I have friends who work at Meta, Amazon, Apple, Pinterest. Your manager and the team hiring you matter more than the average company culture.Like I’d say avoid Doordash, but tbh you could be joining under a really great manager.Sidenote: I’ve known two people who joined Amazon. They both hated it. And two others who have been at Amazon for the past 5 years, and are still there.Also for Uber: tell them about your competing offers, and get a sign-on bonus. Or ask any of the companies what signing bonuses they can offer.Hint: lately the cap I’ve seen amongst my friends job hopping the past 6 months has been $50K.",

Not to mention all of the parts surrounding just administration of users and access you take for granted in an out of the box solution. Makes me really skeptical of these 'we used AI to replace this entire thing' articles. Klarna itself had a popular article saying they 'replaced Salesforce' which seems borderline impossible to anyone who knows anything CRM and how sticky those solutions are once you implement them. [Turns out it was basically just business process that they actually worked on](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/klarna-ceo-doubts-that-other-companies-will-replace-salesforce-with-ai/):>“We did not replace SaaS with an LLM, and storing CRM data in an LLM would have its limitations. “But we developed an internal tech stack using Neo4j (a Swedish graph database company) to start bringing data = knowledge together.”",

For example, let’s say you worked for Looker when they were smaller and trying to sell their BI tool. You would make dashboards showing off the tool and also be able to answer technical questions. Pros of this job: you do basic coding but depending on the product is how difficult it will get. Get to speak with people and not be cooped up on your own all day. I’ve also heard that Sales Engineers make bank, but that’s purely anecdotal. Cons: have to deal with customers, type of coding might not be as “fulfilling” as pushing something to production at another company. Salary might be tied to sales targets.",

An extra 30k/yr snowballing into 1k/mo or whatever in capital growth after 10 years is not nothing. There's a world of difference between having a chill/boring job vs not having to have a job in the first place, and with the high pay ceilings in this profession, the latter is reasonably achievable.",

Meta is one, and I know Duolingo did too in the early days, but AFAIK most companies don't do rapid fire serial promos. Some people try to get around it via job hopping, but I've done hundreds of interviews for L3-L6 and it's incredibly uncommon to see serial L+1 hops, let alone within short intervals, especially after L5, because impact at higher levels simply doesn't materialize that quickly.",

Do those three things well, and you're a decent lead.That said, I'm a Senior in a Team Lead role, and I definitely agree that it's not for everyone. At least at my company, there's an understanding that the role should be filled with a Staff engineer, and although I felt like I had to step up, there are plenty of other seniors engineers in the org who could step up as well. I eventually want to get promoted to Staff Engineer, so it seemed like good experience to be a tech lead and deliver on a big prjoect.If you want to just be an IC, which I think is acceptable, then it's not going to work out. They hired you for the role, and asking for additional money to do the job they hired you for isn't going to go over well.

Another individual in the same meeting kept asking so many questions that a process A to B to C becomes a process A,Z D back to B and C. Thats what they want \"Ask Questions\".",

There is clearly a disconnect between how you see yourself and how they see the role that you are employed to operate.I’d also encourage you to bring some of these questions to these people. “What’s the point in leading meetings, id rather just listen to the subject-matter experts” is a question that I’d bet they would be happy to expand on, for example.Technical leadership is difficult, and for better or worse, the higher levels of engineering are just as much about people and process as they are about technology. There’s a more expansive frame of ownership than just “I write some docs and do the tickets.”",

Some may be lucky enough to find another role internally, but losing your job hurts and is a very stressful time.A silver lining perhaps is that these losses seem to be Seattle-focused. If laid-off, being in Seattle and a current employee will almost certainly put you at the top of the list for hiring, in the area where the most jobs are.What I'll also add is that it's worth noting where these layoffs have occurred. Devices is a huge org, but many of the divisions are ones where new products were recently launched or are due to be launched. That's not a great look for Amazon, especially if the new versions of Alexa, Zoox, or Kuiper start to suffer issues. It's equally a really shitty look internally if these are successful - why the fuck would you work hard to make something a success when your payoff is losing your job?",

But before I finished my degree I was a retail manager at a store doing 5-6 figures a day with like 40 people on my payroll and although I hated the general public, I *love* that kind of RTS style, “everything’s on fire” hecticness in a typical CS environment so I’m biased lol For me, the pay bands on DA and PMs are more than enough and I’m not passionate enough about software to get too crazy just for the chance of maybe working a faang adjacent job. I’d rather do the adjacent stuff and build stuff I’m passionate about",

Anyways, the only one that likely has something to do with AI is improved results from offshoring. But that's been enabled by better tech in general as well; its easy to add remote employees to your Slack and more or less have them be indistinguishable from their US counterparts. Everything else is more related to the typical boring market forces type stuff. that's why it doesn't get as much airtime outside of people in the industry.",

Each thing your do here increases your chances of success: Before interviewing- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. - come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, - build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot- create a portfolio siteSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:- dont be as stringent about pay- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)- be willing to relocate- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. - always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. Most importantly...- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead. Don't doom yourself, if you get rejected sometimes it has nothing to do with what you did and is out of your control, and lastly, JUST KEEP BUILDING LEARNING AND GROWING!!! EVERY DAY!!",

If they're accessing this information after you already accepted an offer, there's really not a lot of malicious things they can do with your work history as long as that history isn't noteworthy - like, if you've had standard jobs, those are the jobs listed on your resume, and you've had reasonable salary progression along the way.But if you don't fall in that category, you should be very careful with this info. Things that immediately come to mind:* If you \"embelished\" or straight up lied about your current compensation during salary negotiations. Like, if you said you were making $200K and they used that info to offer you $240K and then they find out you're actually making $150K, that could have negative repercussions* If you had any jobs that you didn't put on your resume that you might not want them to see - like, if you said you had an employment gap but were actually doing work for a somewhat controversial company. Or if you lied about having a job or how long you were there.* As OP said - union membership, reason for termination, etc. I feel like those are all touchy subjects that could have repercussions.All that to say - I think for a lot of people, this doesn't really matter that much. But you probaby should look at it and figure out if it does - especially if something in there is wrong.",

It is your responsibility as the senior reviewing PRs to provide feedback to the person making the pull request that enables them to address your concerns with their code.OP, your issue here is that Mr.Newbie isn't pulling from your developer branch to merge the latest set of already merged code into their code, assuming your org is using *proper* version control guidelines of developers having personal branches per story, the team having a dev branch for every sprint and PRing work from the stories to the dev branch, then the dev branch to the main demo branch, then the demo branch to the production branch for use by the users. If your org is managing branches properly, the issue here is that Mr.Newbie wasn't pulling from the developer branch before PR'ing their branch to the dev branch. These conflicts tend to happen when multiple people are working on the same file. If anything, your frustration at this common inconvenience is itself indicative of a relative lack of experience working with version control in a group setting. **Try to be understanding of what it is like to be inexperienced with unfamiliar tools and a good mentor for the newhire.** Everyone is new to these tools at some point in their career, even you.Once you are both pulling from dev before PRing to dev, you'll have to *intelligently handle any merging conflicts on your local build***, so be sure to push your changes before pulling to ensure you don't lose any work if you make a mistake.** Try to become a mentor for the newhire and retain a positive attitude about the team expanding. You should make an effort to find ways to gain visibility for your mentorship and beat the drum of how much progress you've made with training the newhire to resolve these issues during your scrums so that you get credit for the effort. Tbh, just showing up to work being able to explain that fairly basic solution to your org's problem and pitch the answer to it to your team ought to resolve the issue and make yourself seem rather knowledgeable in your next meeting.

If you want to aim broad, that’s your prerogative but employers typically are looking for relatively narrow ranges of specialization with some level of depth. So you’d want to, at a minimum, have different resumes that cater more closely to the respective classes of job descriptions, and get more in depth than surface level keywords (e.g. anyone can name drop programming languages, but what about frameworks, ecosystem, etc)Alternatively go deep on one thing by hustling the crap out of that thing.

I ended up getting a pretty good TC (220k TC: 155k cash, 30k bonus, 35k stock). I think I posted my resume before, so you can take a look at my previous experience. In general for a new grad, the bands are pretty tight (I could only get 10k higher even with another job offer as leverage). The big disparity in pay comes from the differences in companies. You shouldn’t be asking if your experience gets you $X, but rather if your resume (and interview skills) can get you into a FAANG-level company. Given the job market, this means you need something that makes you stand out on paper and in person. Also, I would recommend not doing a PhD unless you’re really, really passionate. It’s not really a “pass the time” or “get more money” thing. Especially due to the DoE budget cuts, full funding may be unstable in many places over the next few years. This means you need to be competitive in your lab/department to retain funding if anything gets impacted.Also, maybe it’s an anecdotal experience, but all the professors I’ve talked to said it’s a slight red flag to do a PhD at the same undergraduate school since you want to diversify your research and education.",

I feel like there's a lot more I can learn about what a candidate excels at and what their decision-making and prioritization look like when they're working unrestrained, instead of how well they played their previous company's \"how to get good metrics so you don't get laid off\" Mario Party mini-game.",

Big shift from Vue2 to 3. Also, going from Bootstrap 4 to 5 they felt the need to rename a bunch of classes in a way that broke backwards compatibility for... no discernible reason.This kind of attitude, unfortunately, trickles down a bit here and there to backend development as well (.NET 5 and on, for example, being a totally different architecture), but not as bad.",

It still wasn't enough. Some people here are making fun of you but you're not the only one. For some reason we fell through the cracks. I don't know about you, but I really enjoy making iOS apps but unfortunately it seems nobody hired entry level mobile developers. Even during the so called great hiring market of 2021. I signed up with Revature and am learning backend. They are kind of my last hope. If this fails, I have some backup plans. Mine are real estate (already have a license), getting a teaching license, or moving abroad to teach English (only a degree in any field required).",

The wrong choice is work extra hours to meet these expectations. This is the wrong choice because all this will do is set this as the new norm expectation and will also give them permission to push you further when crunch time happens. You will never benefit from this choice and will pay the price later on for it when you don't meet expectations when the expectations go up.Choice two is you clearly communicate in sprint planning that the stories being provided to you and your team is too high. You communicate that clearly as a team to the manager. If the manager doesn't care, cool. Then don't meet the goals and clearly communicate in retro why that wasn't done. Also, document in email writing somewhere so you have proof this was communicated to the manager. Not in a adversarial way. Just a way so they can't come back and claim no one told them.Then let manager deal with fallout of not meeting plans. As that is there job, not yours. Your job is just to do the tasks you are assigned and clearly communicate to the manager when expectations are being set are not realistic.If this is a problem for your manager, then you need to look for a new employer.

Like, I've seriously seen founders near tears at the inability to make that call. (It doesn't fucking matter, BTW, if you can figure out competence and you can fire.)But you have it right. One screen. 2-3 team interviews (20 minutes each, just an intro), a take home test, and a review of that test. You can easily compress that into one office visit of half a day, or some quick zooms.

The interview process was generally:* HR Intro Call* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen* On-site panel interview for 2 hours / 2 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour eachFrankly it's harder to get an offer now, because companies are more picky. They are scared to death of a false positive hire and will sacrifice the false negative hire all day every day. I personally think there are tons of talent out there that with some ramp up time on the job would be an excellent SWE.Every company I have worked for over my 15 YOE never really had issues hiring once candidates applied. Granted these were non-tech companies in non-tech cities so they were not hiring out of the same pool of candidates as bit tech companies. If you could do reverse a string level problems with C or C++ you would get an offer. These companies were fine with ramp up time and showing candidates, at all levels, what they needed to know to do the job. Just finding people that had an aptitude for being a SWE was the problem. Aptitude does not mean some rock star coder, but could wrap their head around concepts when shown to them.Granted I've never applied to a startup, so maybe that world is different.",

Thankfully one of them realy wanted me and I got a job wihtin 3 months but Id still be jobless if it wasnt for that one job as most places I havent heard back from yet.I dont mean to scare you, I dont think it's impossible but you will have to be patient and do extra work to get callbacks. My adivce, apply everywhere. The job I got I had applied in december and didnt hear from them until april. So really if something pops up, apply and dont give up because you didnt hear back from them. Use linkedin and indeed (and other 3rd party sites) as search engines only. I would find positions and immedately apply through the company site. I dont know if this is true but Ive heard company sites will not look at 3rd party applications if they get enough from their main site. Use AI as a proofreader for your resume. You should write your own resume and then put it in AI. Dont copy-paste everything they say, more like use some phrases and mixi it inwith your resume to make it sound like a human made it.",

The one and only way to know how the market is going to treat *you* is by applying yourself. The market does not treat everyone equally. For example, I job searched in 2024 with 11 YOE, and didn't struggle at all to find a job. And yet I see countless stories of people with the same YOE as me, or more, post on this subreddit (in 2024, and now) complaining how they can't even get a single interview.It can be hard to believe if your one and only source of information is this subreddit, but there are plenty of people with 2 YOE out there that aren't struggling at all to find a job. There's also plenty of new grads lining up just fine as well. They just aren't posting on an advice subreddit, because they *don't need advice*.Not only all that, but the market was *also* bad in 2023. Yet look at you! You got a job with 0 YOE! You must be doing something right. Something that a lot of other people in 2023 weren't doing, because there were tons of people struggling back then as well. So presumably youl'l be doing that same thing right today.You're worrying before even trying. Come back to us in a few months if you can't find a job.",

First, it’s a team of exceptional people who attained the title of staff+ naturally. This could be a stellar move for your career if this were the case. The second, and probably more likely, possibility is less rosy. It’s a team of older engineers who are content to stay in one place and keep the lights on. They‘ve been at this place so long that their COL raises may have forced HR to put them in a higher pay band. I’ve seen both of these. I left the second one within 5 months and it was damaging to my career. I got paged constantly, there were memory leaks, they were deploying by building artifacts locally and dropping them into prod servers with ftp. You need to figure out what end this falls on.",

You can read the code it outputs, but trust me - you can't understand it. Learning programming up to professional level is all about hitting those walls for weeks at time before it all ,,clicks''. You're saying that it would take 4x as long to learn - I'm saying that it's probably 20-30x longer - and that's the process that you consider ,,skipping'' now.Consider this: If OpenAI has a week long outage can you be productive or do you take that week off because it's like someone turned your brain off?To work in this industry, you **need** to be able to code, brainstorm and reason about the flow of logic in a big complex project. If you don't do it, you're maybe 20% better than a rando of a street after 2 weeks of crash course on vibe coding because you have algo/ds classes over him. You're still not getting a job from me.I'm a Principal SWE at a big company with over 10 years of experience and when we interview we would never hire a person that cannot code without AI assistance.

Until I realized my friends that left at year 1 or 2 and switched companies every 2-3 years were making much more money. But I stayed because I had engaging important work and enjoyed my coworkers. Eventually things changed and I enjoyed the job a whole lot less.Switching companies got me like a 40% raise. My buddies at the old company talk about hoping to hit 140 or 150k TC after bonus time while I'm trying to get closer to 200k while working remotely. And I know friends that make more than than working remotely as well because they switch from tech company to tech focused company every year or 3. And obviously FAANG or anything in certain locations(Bay area/Seattle/NYC) are going to have much higher TC.",

If you are happy with the money you make, the company culture, etc. It's ok not being the guy who is always innovative and working on things that change the world. We are told from the second we decide to be engineers that we need to work on things that change the world and when we are stagnant we feel like we are \"stealing money\". Staying at this company can increase job security too. Im sure many people your age are job-hopping to more money but more stressful jobs. Your company may appreciate how you stayed, give you huge promotions and when it comes down to layoffs they wont consider laying off a person who has been there 10+ years and knows the system and someone who everybody loves. To see the other side of the coin, it is completely fine being the person who wants to work extra create innovative code, etc. All i say is dont do it because you are under this impression SWEs need to be on the go all the time.",

The two of us working just barely managed to put together enough money for a down payment on a house.I started doing some open source which got some traction and that eventually led to another job for like a 60% increase. A couple years later, that open source project got me scouted into a big tech company for another 150% increase. My pay at this company more than doubled in the 8 years I've been there. I make and have enough money now that I don't really need to work anymore (I still do because I like the work, but my wife quit the rat race)By contrast, there's this guy that occasionally posts in salary progression threads here who worked 15 years in a single non-tech company with the steady 3% raises throughout. He was at low one hundies mark when he left his job and hasn't found a job in a few years, last time he gave an update.I think these two points should give you a decent idea of the range of possibilities going forward from where you are. I know a bunch of other lifers/old timers from my first job earning in the 120-200k range, so that's probably the \"normal\" ceiling for most people.",

Startups fire people all the time, for me the question is what did you learn and how do you want to apply that going forward? Don't think of it as a purely technical question. Think about the people, processes, and the exchange between different teams that you noticed. Only four months in a job is a speed bump at the very beginning of your career.

I had trouble finding work recently and hooked up with a firm that got me placed at a company that I couldn’t secure and interview for directly.

A few years ago, following something like this would almost gaurantee you a job. THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. Without a degree, and without experience, practically no company in America will hire you for a CS related job. No matter how skilled you are, it doesnt matter because there are so many good candidates with degrees struggling. Why would a company do the effort to evaluate you, when they can spend that effort interviewing people with a CS degree. Maybe in the future, something like this and bootcamps will be viable again. But I don't see that happening anytime soon. If you want to work in this field, you need a degree at the bare minimum. Something like WGU would at least get you past the automated resume checker. This pathway would not. Following something like this, if you were lucky and skilled, might lead to a job where you are underpaid and overworked to get your foot in the door at best. Most likely you won't even get a single interview. I'm sorry it's this way, and this situation brings me no pleasure, but this is the simple truth.",

It's not really about being able to talk about math topics relevant to CS like groups, rings, fields, graphs, combinatorics, etc. but it's more like the ability to think about how your code logically \"guarantees\" certain outputs given certain inputs.",

People do get lucky, and I mean lucky, and get jobs without degrees, but it’s few and far between currently. To note, I am only talking about post 2022 to present. Before 2022, the need for junior level developers was a lot higher, but with outsourcing and AI, junior level tasks no longer need an associate to complete. Not to mention during Covid, overhiring was ramped and some companies are still trimming the fat with layoffs.As a graduate you are expected to have atleast one internship under your belt, with a year of experience, and a deep understanding of CS. CsMajors who lack a portfolio or skills will not make it through technical interviews but will beat out ATS filtering because of the degree. I would say also, the notion the average CS major can’t code is relatively false on average, an average CS graduate is relatively capable, but there is roughly bottom 20% who are completely lost. Now keep in mind there are fewer jobs in SWE then their used to be, and more CS graduates both in Bachelors and Masters programs then ever before. Most good companies will receive 100s of applicants and have only 2 jobs available. From a business perspective, why not filter by degrees and get an academically strong candidate with experience and a portfolio. To beat this out you will likely need a strong open source portfolio, with live production level applications and very good networking, I can not emphasize this enough, without a degree you will need to be well networked. It’s possible but it is an uphill battle often as you don’t have the resources of college students or a piece of paper saying you know what you know. Again I’m not saying you shouldn’t try, but I am trying to warn you, switching into tech rn, might not be as easy as it was once advertised. Best of luck, I really do not envy people looking to get into tech today.As for my creds… I was a college TA and tutor for CS classes, currently a SWE and I conduct interviews at my current company. If you want specific advice, I’d be happy to help.",

You don’t need to pick a major right away, and you should explore that especially in the first year or so.2. I would say, you should ask yourself what is something YOU would want to build, and try to find resources online that tell you how to build it. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy, maybe a small tip calculator project or something. If it’s something you can figure out, and you find that you enjoy doing it, then there’s a good chance that you’ll enjoy a career in CS and could potentially figure it out in time. If you find that it’s too confusing to do even a small simple project or that you absolutely hated doing it, then this is probably not the career for you. Most engineers would tell you, the reason they enjoy CS is that feeling you get when you spent hours trying to figure out how to do that one thing and FINALLY figure it out. There is no better feeling. The reason I got into programming was because I liked making mods for games.3. Explore IT a bit too, look into networking, security, hardware, etc. I’m not in IT, so I can’t give you as much advice on it. But before you decide on a major, be sure it’s something you could see yourself doing everyday. You don’t want to waste time and money on a major that you hate.",

All it takes is one management change, one bad/good quarter, hell even one SWE hire can flip a team's culture upside down. It's only a matter of time.With that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that. Once the WLB changes for the worse, and I'm *forced* to job hop is when I'll get the nice salary bump to be re-adjusted to market rate.$40k-$55k extra wouldn't make me consider leaving an otherwise good gig for even a moment. Irrespective of market, but it's doubly true in bad markets. If we're talking about $40k to $80k it'd be a different conversation, but $110k to $150k wouldn't cause me to jump ship.That's just me though. These are *my* priorities, and *my* goals in life. My answer only makes sense in that context. Someone that's foused on grinding money would think I'm crazy, and in their world, I am. Different strokes.Think about what's important to *you*.",

No job is perfectly secure. Lots of people who were working for the government, gov. contractors, and research institutions who thought they would have a job forever are now looking. The best job security is the kind you make yourself, by having a diverse skillset and a wide reaching network. Working at different places is the easiest way to do that. 3. there’s absolutely no harm in submitting some resumes and taking a few interviews. You’re actually in the best possible position. You don’t need a job right now, you have one that you like and could stay at. You’re not in any hurry. Only apply for jobs here and there that seem very interesting to you, that meet your preferences (remote, etc.). If you do a couple interviews and git a whiff of bad WLB, bail. If you do go through all the way and get an offer, start your negotiations at a stupid high salary, what do you have to lose?",

I've made the transition from startups and mid-sized, low-billions-valuation companies to FANG. It wasn't hard for me to get interviews, as this was many years ago when FANG recruiters would reach out on LinkedIn and such. It was harder to get offers (there's more luck involved than anyone tells you), but I managed to do it by Leetcoding and really trying to understand the algorithms and patterns instead of memorizing solutions. There has been Leetcode escalation since my time there, but I don't have enough interview experience these days to tell you how much.I think if you're just in it for the TC and/or life experience to be at a FANG/Fortune 5 company first hand, then definitely at least try it so you don't feel like you missed something. I'm glad I did just so I knew what it was like.I would recommend against it if you are expecting to seriously level up your dev game. If you're already a highly productive dev at your company and you deliver things faster than your peers and understand all of the tradeoffs of your tech, then you probably won't learn as much as you might think. You'll probably just learn how to use their old, custom tools that solve the same problems you've already solved at your startup but with more popular, open-source tools. Some of what you hear about crazy WLB is because at one point (and maybe still, I don't know) FANG was hiring a ton of new grads who didn't know anything and then were dropped in the deep end. I wasn't at FANG very long, but I still saw many interns and new grad hires cycle through my team and it seemed like a lot of what they didn't like were just things they didn't know because they had no other work experience.I can't say it was the right move career wise because I'm personally of the belief that FANG doesn't have the reputation it once had and could be off-putting to some in this hyper-polarized society we live in now. Many of my teammates at a local company would actively trash FANG and viewed people who worked there as being active and willing participants in hurting society (not joking). At the very least, I suspect saying you worked at FANG today will be kind of like hearing another dev tell you about how they worked at Yahoo in the '90s. Maybe a cool story but won't really open any doors. But I have no regrets!Best of luck to you!",

Team has done it before and have some experience - this is gonna be the biggest one for me as a white beard. If these are noobs who have never done this before and they don’t have their stuff together I usually say no thanks. 2. Funding. Is know ln and shared - if there is any outside funding I want to make sure there is ramp and they are open with it. If the total $ isn’t shared and I have no idea how much people are making then no thanks. 3. Competition - having someone you can directly compete against is a good thing because it means you aren’t going to be pivoting daily. 4. Clients - this is the biggest thing for me. If I’m building something that my clients want and have hired us and recommended us to their friends I’m all over this. It happens all of the time in niches and if you can get into a shop like this it’s a good sign.",

        "body": "If you work at a company that is expected to be online 24/7, there will always be 24/7 on call. So if the on call by itself is your issue, you'd need to look for teams whose products are only used during business hours. They're definitely out there, but not super common.From a rotation/frequency standpoint what you're describing is pretty standard. I've been on call at every company I've worked for, the rotations have always lasted 2 weeks, and the frequency of rotation obviously depended on how large the team was.The issue to me personally would be the amount of calls you're getting after hours. The word \"normal\" isn't a useful term to use for things like this, because being called super frequently absolutely *is* normal at a lot of companies. But it's not normal at others. There isn't an industry-wide normality you can refer to, there's a lot of variety.One thing I make it a point to do when I'm reverse-interviewing is discuss exactly this. I ask about rotation, how many times they get after-hours calls, business-hours calls, an example of what the team did in reaction to an after hours call, etc. I'm trying to establish the product stability and the team norms so I can decide to join or not.What I'm usually looking for when I ask about after-hours calls is a few calls *per year*. After hours calls need to be treated extremely seriously, and should be \"Fix ASAP\" kind of issues. If the product is so on fire that they can't keep up with patching after-hours issues, and you're getting called even once a week, I want no part of that product.When I was job searching in 2021 I had offers from several companies. When I asked one of them about after-hours calls, the hiring manager smiled and proudly said \"we only get a few calls a month!\".... the fact that was *good* in their mind set off alarm bells in mine. Another company responded \"Well the product's only a couple years old, but we've never been called after hours so far, most of our support issues are during business hours\". Green flag. I joined them. I only ended up staying there about 2.5 years, but I indeed got called 0 times after hours during that time.",

We get paid a retainer for the shift which works out to approximately 1-2 hours of pay for week days, and it’s double at weekends, quadruple on bank holidays. If there is an incident outside of work hours, then we get paid OT for dealing with it, starting from 1 hour and otherwise rounded to the nearest 30 mins.

AI, no AI, it doesn't matter, the buck has to stop with someone, and that's a variety of managers.I do think there is truth to your statement, though. At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the \"team of teams\" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.In my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.After all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team. Maybe that's niave, but the only way to be trusted to build anything significant, or lead, is to have a manager agree to the spend.",

I think the general consensus is that new grads need about 6 months to fully onboard and become truly productive, contributing members of their teams. So in effect, to potential employers, you only have 6 months of actual experience doing the job. Again, that isn’t nothing, but it *really* isn’t much. Then there’s the question of why you’re looking for a new job so soon, and by that point it’s probably a tough sell unless you have a good referral that can vouch for you (also unlikely with only 1 YOE).By all means apply for roles that you find interesting and aren’t much of a stretch, but you’re up against some decent headwinds that will affect your success rate.",

I think it's fine to have a similar resume as you dont really have that much experience so they may see you as a college grad hire with some experince. Add your current experience and when asked, tell them more or less what you said here. Say you felt the job wasnt in line with what you wanted for yourself. As for promotions, it may hold you back a year. Really depends on job and on you. Promotions arent really due to YOE. It's a factor but really promotions are due to your output. If your output is expected than expect 2-3 years to get promoted. If you always over-perfrom expect to get promoted quickly. It's easier to go from SWE1 to SWE2 than it is to SWE2 to Sr SWE. Basically the higher you go up the harder it becomes to go to the following level. So you aren't really in a bad position. If you try to overperform your first year you may get promoted between 12-18 months at the job.",

The tradeoff here is that for above pay band talent, you need to invest in training them, or at least hire someone who can self-onboard.* Offer the use of technology, like Rust, or Haskell, or anything else, that people will pay a passion tax for. I'm not sure if Electron is this, and this is more a decision that needed to have been made when picking out the tech stack.* Offer responsibilities and ownership far above what the level of talent you are looking for would otherwise get. A decent mid or junior can make bank and work for a company where they are insulated from all decision makingI work at a big tech company, but pound for pound, the best dev team I've ever been on was at a Haskell start up: nearly everyone was a career changer, and loved Haskell. That love of the language was a requirement, and we got some really awesome people.What's also important to consider, is that you are making an offer to the market, and the simplest way this problem is solved is just more money.",
