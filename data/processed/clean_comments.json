It doesn't seem necessary to mention in an ML stack, I only use it to refine a model and that's about it unless I am missing something. Jupyter Hub too, you don't need it, it's just a collaboration tool and not sure why it would be recommended to use. Jupyter notebooks yes, but Jupyter Hub? MLFlow makes sense, orchestration is important, and I have never use Feast but I feel this section doesn't tell me what I want to know in this context. You list different AI models, which is also a bit awkward considering how much they change, but why not list ML models like Tensorflow Keras or XGBoost/Catboost? To be even more honest, I don't think your audience will get past the first row of tools. If somebody is looking at this to learn, they'll stop there because why bother with the other tools when AI and vibe coding can do it all?",

Now, that isn‘t so elegant when you need to chain together airbyte then and only then running dbt. But people do that using might lighter weight tools than airflow. You could use some of the various task and workflow or event resources in the big 3. airbyte has web hooks that fire on run completion. airflow and dagster are good.

If you want to tear down data silos, you have to set and enforce standards of data quality. if you want to enforce these standards, you will have to change how a *lot* of people do things.I've only ever been in one organization where there was enough political capital to change how a lot of people do their day to day work and that was because the CEO ruled with an iron fist and wanted it done. There was a 30 page monthly executive report that came from dozens of data silos. We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. I've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos. It sounds good in theory but if the marketing team only cares about marketing data and doesn't mind getting financial data a month late, then why go throught the considerable time and effort to build a third system to combine marketing and financial data? Especially if after the system is created, you have train people on how to use it, how to keep the data clean, and how to maintain the 3rd system.",

That way people can just query the Parquet file to get link(s) to where they can download the dataset.For the DGUIDs, I have to be really careful. I don't want to say that I have modified any statistical information, so I have emailed Statistics Canada with the blog post I made, so hopefully they address some of these issues. I could do the fixes on the client-side and call it **backfill-dguid**, so the user is aware they are back-filling the field.**Edit:** For the DGUID I want to experiment with linking to Overture Maps, as they have boundaries on places/divisions. They have something called GERS \\[4\\] that I can link to, that is a stable ID throughout time.

This has also to be derived from a dataframe but much more directly. So there is a sort of \"compiler\" step that executes on the driver, completely negligible if you are using Spark to its intended use: processing fat data.Now the real question about SQL Vs dataframe is the language you use to define transformations.IMO dataframe is much more modular (can be structured into functions, steps, that can be tested independently), much clearer for defining data pipelines (source to sink order), and have proper syntax highlighting in most scala and python IDEs.It also has the added benefit of integrating better with UDFs, as they can just be the same language functions injected into the DF code.",

When creating a new table from existing table using dataframe write method, it does not copy over the ACLs (at container and blob level). You have to deal with the separately. But with CTAS SQL the case is different, it applies the ACLs from the location of old external table to the location of new external table. That’s awesome.",

In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark’s pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.Among other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark’s behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it’s built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.# What’s New in Sail 0.3* **Compatibility** with Spark 4.0’s new `pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.* **Changes in the installation command** now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.* **Automatic detection of PySpark version** in the Python environment adjusts Sail’s runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.* **Automatic Python unit testing** on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.* **Faster object store performance,** reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.* **New and improved documentation** with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.# Our MissionAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.# Join the Slack CommunityThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and engage with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing. We would love to connect with you!",

AI tools are not good at building something net-new or with systems programming yet, and I don't see that changing any time soon.My company sells to data engineering teams, so I get frontline seats to watching them operate and leverage the latest AI tools these days. I emphasize the word \"tool\" because I don't see them replacing these teams, but it really does increase productivity a lot. E.g. mass SQL code migrations onto a new platform and a lot of the operational pipeline-building grunt work etc happening in days instead of months.",

The data strategy is what gets created to help them accomplish this.

Get comfortable packaging Python jobs in containers, wiring them into CI/CD, and writing tests with pytest; that’s the bridge from classic ETL to modern DE. Learn dbt for in-warehouse transforms so you can show you can model data the “analytics” way, and skim Spark only enough to talk partitioning and schema evolution-real heavy lifting there is less common than the hype suggests. Fivetran covers the boring ingestion so you can focus on orchestration; I’ve also kept DreamFactory in the mix when I need instant REST endpoints over old SQL Server tables. With that stack you can pitch yourself as a senior who happens to be deep on Microsoft rather than a mid-level up-skiller. Main point: layer modern tooling on your existing strengths and you’ll stay competitive.",

I personally like Docker even though more for DevOps but it’s great to know also maybe a little bit of Linux. Writing docker files/yml is good to know don’t need to be an expert at every single thing again knowing the basics and when to use should suffice. Yes orchestration like airflow and some knowledge of APIs. I believe you don’t have to be the super expert but knowing how these applications/services work would be a great benefit. Try to avoid buzzwords, HR/recruiter and new shiny tools every 5 mins there’s always going to be something new. Focus on your fundamentals and add databricks DBT? something solid be open and honest and think about what’s useful? Why is it useful for this scenario etc. lastly a visualization tool Tableau/Looker etc. Good luck you got this.",

Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.Also pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.For loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.I would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture. In practice companies will implement it in different ways but it's worth getting comfortable with teminology and how it's generally applied:https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture",

If you use it - you can run DuckDB as a server on huge cloud VMs (like the one in the 1 Trillion-row challenge) - and allow clients to connect to it remotely via Arrow Flight SQL JDBC/ADBC/ODBC drivers...I hope this is helpful!

Often the people conducting the interviews are themselves out-of-date in their knowledge, and ask the types of questions you mention, because that's how it was done ten years ago are they haven't changed much since then. Your final thoughts there \"Felt very surface-level and disorganized — no discussion of pipelines, tooling, architecture, or even team dynamics,\" are very indicative of how it will be to work there. Expect disorganized approaches to projects with a lack of technical leadership on best practices with a modern data stack.

I think this is the closest to what you're asking, but will most likely be dissapointed in the lack of functionality.\\* Dagster - great if you're only doing \"ETL\" but the whole premise is kind of that every task that runs is a table in your database... not great for doing more general things even if it is \"doable\".\\* Cron - just schedule with cron, what could possibly go wrong? except loads of functionality for retry/error handling and stuff\\* Windows Task Manager - (yea not kidding) better than Cron, but worse than any other option. Going completely \"off script\" you could also just run DBT. We did investigate the concept of using DBT's \"Python Models\" to run arbitrary python code that would pull in data from different sources. But in the end settled for just using DBT for transforming data that's already in the DWH and using Airflow (MWAA) to run python ingestion scripts and to then also run DBT.",

It would just be extra tooling you'd be learning for no gain, for your use case. They're fine tools for other situations, but it's very likely you can accomplish everything you need already using using just the features of SQL Server.Personally, I'd prefer to get everything to one server which you can do pretty simply with either Replication or Log Shipping (though there's other options too). And for any large tables that you'll be running OLAP against, you could try columnstore indexing to satisfy your query performance needs. Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.I say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",

This means taking 2-3 core tables through the entire pipeline so you can spot the real issues (data quality, timing, dependencies). For your ERP API extraction, Windsor.ai might be worth exploring. It handles the connector work and pushes data straight into your warehouse, letting you focus on modeling instead of wrestling with API rate limits and data formatting quirks.Stick with SQL Server + SSIS/Python for extraction (or a connector), dbt for modeling, and Prefect for orchestration if you want that Python comfort zone.

        "body": "There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**This is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. For example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, \"real-time\" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. That said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.**Complex transformations (2)**It's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.Fundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute \"incrementally\". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables \"change\" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.For an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables \"change\" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).What this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**You are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.When it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).For example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).**Hype vs reality (5)**There is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",

        "body": "First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered \"correct\" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you. Not a senior data engineer. They are not the same thing.",

If we still had to visualize that layer, we would still need GeoMesa and would still be using HDFS.We could have migrated to s3 for the GeoMesa backend, but the performance hit on visualization was significant.Geospatial performance is often weird. Our golang devs were shocked when compressed XML-based GML over REST trounced serialized avro over REST and flatgeobuf protobuf over gRPC in performance testbeds. They expected nothing to touch protobuf over gRPC, much less have xml over rest beat it so badly. (It's because GML is so highly optimized from years of experience, while flatgeobuf is still hampered by basically having to transmit the entire range of geospatial object attributes for every feature still to function as WFS, even as gRPC.)",

Typically organizations will have their own player ID keys, but unless you already have the mapping figured out, someone else's keys aren't helpful, and there's a new batch of rookies every year. So you end up with waterfall fuzzy matching logic which always has to end with some hard-coded exceptions that need to be regularly added to.

Some other comments here have covered it -- matching things by name or by address, rather than by concrete id values.Not only does it need a variety of fuzzy matching approaches, it also requires domain knowledge to understand what types of fuzzing can be used rather than just plain string distance. You want to know how to parse things like addresses or names into components, with different rules for different types of addresses/names. You want to figure out which aspects can be ignored or moved around, or can have specific changes.Even when you have it working well, it is still only 90%, and the last of it is always a continuous manual process of fixing things that didn't quite work, and your rule set just can't handle the subtleties that a person can manually implement.A great annoyance is the business looks at it and thinks 'this is easy for me to figure out, why can't you just write an algo for it? it should be easy' - not understanding how trying to implement all the nuance of human understanding is impossible.

The fundamentals, however, change very little—unless there’s a true paradigm shift.

If you're aiming to move into leadership, you'll need to develop skills in business and finance.You're in a strong position if you can both \"get your hands dirty\" when needed and also see the bigger picture. The next step is learning how to communicate that vision to people who have little to no understanding of data—and doing it in a way that drives action and buy-in.",

Understanding what tools to use while keeping complexity and cost to a minimum, also crucial, because it's easy to over-engineer.

PostgREST works fine as long as the query patterns are predictable; cache the common ones at Cloudflare edge with a long TTL so the box only sees cold misses. For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch. If you really want to squeeze the VPS, move the Parquet layer to a Trino or DuckDB service and only ingest the hot partitions into Postgres nightly; that keeps storage and vacuum overhead low. I kicked the tires on Hasura and Postgraphile, but DreamFactory ended up easiest when I needed a quick autogen REST layer with per-key RBAC. Finally, measure disk random read before anything else-IOPS is what will bite you way before CPU or memory. Cheapest path is well-tuned Postgres plus aggressive caching.",

I don't really recommend it for most use cases. Connections and editing in Grafana is a simpler experience but it has its own annoying quirks (the plotting UX is underwhelming and has weird data transform abstractions that I find myself fighting with rather than enjoying) and it's generally not as flexible as I would like it to be. I don't use any of the advanced alerting features. I'd like to, but I haven't figured them out yet. My favorite part of Grafana is the units and formatting support, it really is nice and convenient. It's not great, but it's better than superset.NiFi gets a lot of hate, but I am a firm believer in \"there's a time and place for every tool\". The time and place that NiFi was developed for was the NSA. A lot of the stuff that it was good at was classified and got dropped when it was published. Now, Nifi is good for moving data around from point to point, not data transformations. You'll want something else for more advanced data transformation, such as something with real scripting language support (nifi's code editor sucks ass. Basic user interface tasks are also hidden behind different context menus and it's a pain to use, generally. The JOLT processor advanced interface is pretty good though). It is however an okay tool for setting up long-running batch processing jobs from your database to something else where you want to have visual feedback. I set up a number of web scraping flows with it (not really a good use case) and I'm looking to migrate to something that sucks less.Dagster and Airflow are the NiFi alternatives you'll want to consider.

But the intent of this capability is not to edit your source systems or modify the data whose source of truth is in external systems.There are good scenarios for this capability that are reasonably common in BI. In particular:1) \"Writeback\" for data owned by the BI solution, like forecasts, comments, what-if scenarios, like interest rate assumptions, etc.2) \"Insight-to-action\" so taking a business action in response to data. For instance, triggering a maintenance request from an IoT dashboard, generating a marketing cohort from a customer analysis report, or manually triggering a data refresh.3) \"Adjustments and Corrections\". Manual adjustments for reporting made to separate tables and \"rolled up\" in the BI solution.Through integration with Power Apps, Power Automate, and third-party solutions these have been available in Power BI for a long time. The introduction of Fabric User Data Functions, and the integration with Power BI reports just brings this capability into the product itself.",

They are just a way to easily develop serverless functions in Fabric that can be integrated in Power BI reports, taking user selections and entries as input. What they CAN do is update a SQL database such as those you can create in Fabric (if enabled) which Power BI can connect to using direct query mode. They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.In a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events. If you end up working somewhere that has such a need and that extensively uses Power BI and Fabric, using these can be a great quick solution for enforcing clean data entry without having to build a full CRUD app, and it clearly beats using spreadsheets with no data validation for inputs.",

My best jump came from building a tiny warehouse on Postgres: load a public dataset, write the pipeline in plain SQL, then rewrite it in PySpark so you’re forced to map CTEs, windows, and joins to transformations. Follow up with a dbt rewrite; the model tests catch bad assumptions you didn’t realise you made. Drill the planner-explain analyze will teach you more about skew than any blog post. When stuck, screenshot the plan and compare it to the Spark DAG; patterns start to click. Keep a scratch sheet of oddball functions (lateral, array\\_agg, conditional windows) and fold one into every practice query so it sticks. I’ve used Airflow for scheduling and Snowflake for isolated perf tests, but DreamFactory let me spin out quick REST endpoints from the same tables to demo downstream consumers.

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).With this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.Now let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...In the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.I don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",

I have a hard time understanding how you get the information of if your table exist or not to do some different type of actions in your transformation. Is there some state that you can retrieve ? Do you need to query the table yourself and if it fails you known it doesn’t exist?

Without a metastore, you'd check storage directly.But if the table not already existing doesn't affect the required logic, you can just write in overwrite or append mode without the need to handle table existence. Either will implicitly create non-existing targets.For pure DDL operations (just creating a table, not writing any data), if you're using the SQL API then `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` [is available](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html).> can add some parameters to your query to do it ?Yes. Notebook widgets (not advised, notebooks are poor code artefacts), script or function arguments. But you may want to pin this to the runtime state (or lack of) of the target table, a config value, or some combination of these.Typically what Spark code for data warehousing \"looks like\" is some sort of workflow orchestration using a DAG, in something like Luigi/Airflow/Dagster (and/or dbt), which will invoke stuff (scripts, notebooks, dbt runs) as needed and with the required parameters.You can totally run dbt against Spark, the connector is [officially supported](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/spark-setup).",

Also building custom APIs means you need a pretty experienced BI people, cause integrating that into the tools is always harder than use the default connectors. On top of that if you do any ETL with whatever BI tool you use, you get sort of vendor locked, cause it's hard to switch (and Tableau for example is looking worse every year).DW should be aggregating data, not be a one to one copy of production systems.

        "body": "> do modern BI systems need an analytics DatabaseTechnically no, in practice yes. The reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. \"store this order\", \"lookup this invoice\" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. This is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. \"order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment\" or \"show all customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months\".These aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.Another aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.With this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.Regarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.They key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",

You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.Breaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.Having your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.Or, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.SQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",

Scraping the pgAdmin logs after that is an eye-opener.I’ve leaned on dbt tests and Datafold diffing for similar demos, and DreamFactory slid in nicely when I needed the REST layer auto-generated instead of babysitting custom endpoints.Those tweaks keep the sandbox lean while exposing every failure surface in a way that mirrors day-to-day work.",

For contracts, strip it to a single Great Expectations suite that only checks the critical login table; learners learn the pattern without drowning in rules. I’ve used FireHydrant for chaos drills and Datafold for diff diffing, while Pulse for Reddit quietly surfaces edge-case questions from learners before they hit support. End the module by toggling the bad schema back and showing green tests, then stress-test with a ten-row fuzzing script so they feel the full cycle.

We had Microstrategy for years and it liked a snowflake structure, which was a pain in the ass for us. We moved to PowerBI where we could build a nice simple star schema, but things like ragged hierarchies can get complex as in the link below. You may want to look for solutions to ragged hierarchies or whatever related to whichever BI application you are using. We don't have a great need for drilling through hierarchies so we just went with L1, L2.... and the user adds the parent and child descriptive entities if they need that.[https://www.daxpatterns.com/parent-child-hierarchies/](https://www.daxpatterns.com/parent-child-hierarchies/)",

For example, say there's a new cost field - how do you know that some of your existing costs aren't now being split between an existing field and this new one? And of course, how will your code even know it's a cost field?Here's another example, say there's a string field - your code won't know if it requires an adjustment to some of your business logic. Maybe it indicates a cost type?So, if data quality matters, then it's best to have a data contract, and when the upstream system makes changes to that contract then you coordinate with them.Meanwhile, you can compare every record to the data contract to ensure that every row complies and you don't have any unapproved schema drift.",

All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepoCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.Having said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.EDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this: CREATE TABLE example ( old_name String, new_name String DEFAULT old_name ) This effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one. I don't necessarily recommend going this route, but it would prevent going down the versioning rabbit-hole.",

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.If not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.If I were you I would first answer these questions:- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?- How often is new data added to the data lake?- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?And then, Once you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code. I’ve used dbt for model builds and Superset for dashboards, while DreamFactory sat in front to expose quick REST endpoints for the same parquet files when we needed them in other services.

Azure Functions’ HTTP trigger can sit in the same resource group, talk to Postgres via psycopg or pgx, and costs almost nothing at your traffic scale; just wire up five functions (list, get, insert, update, delete) and use managed identity so you never store creds. If you’d rather avoid code, point PostgREST at the database: views become endpoints, row-level security handles auth, and you deploy a single container. Supabase is basically PostgREST plus auth and storage if you need hosted options. I’ve tried PostgREST and Azure Functions, but DreamFactory is what I ended up buying because it handed me locked-down endpoints and swagger docs in under an hour.

In particular, translating the match score into an assessment of match confidence ('almost certain', 'very likely', 'likely' and so on) is much harder if you are not confident that the true match is amongst the candidates which have been scored. The concept of distinguishability becomes a bit less relevant and the absolute score becomes more relevant.",

Most people start strong but lose momentum quickly. Your best bet is to cast a wide net, maybe post in multiple communities or LinkedIn, and be prepared to cycle through a few partners before finding someone reliable.The bigger issue is that mock interviews with peers can only take you so far. Sure, you'll get comfortable talking through technical concepts, but your study partner probably won't know how to ask the tricky behavioral questions or follow up on your answers the way a real interviewer would. They also won't catch the subtle things that could make or break your interview performance. I actually work on [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), which helps people navigate those curveball questions and unexpected moments that even the best study partner can't simulate - it might be worth checking out alongside your peer practice sessions.",

As the queue system is a common need and I believe many of us already have similar use case and they have either thought of or will think of building Queue system using Postgres at some point.Thought of sharing the key design decisions that had to be made on day 1 to tackle some common challenges.### **Challenge 1: Slow Disk Operations*** **Problem:** Writing each events to a disk (as they reach) is extremely inefficient.* **Solution:** Batch events into large groups in memory before writing them to disk.* **Advantage:** Maximizes I/O throughput by working with the disk in a way it's optimized for.### **Challenge 2: Wasted Space*** **Problem:** A single failed event can prevent a large block of otherwise completed events from being deleted, wasting disk space.* **Solution:** Run a periodic \"compaction\" job that copies any remaining unprocessed events into a new block, allowing the old sparse block to be deleted.* **Advantage:** Efficiently reclaims disk space without disrupting the main processing flow.### **Challenge 3: Inefficient Status Updates*** **Problem:** Updating an event's status (e.g., to \"success\") in its original location requires slow random disk writes, creating a bottleneck.* **Solution:** Write all status updates to a separate, dedicated status queue as a simple log.* **Advantage:** Turns slow random writes into extremely fast sequential writes, boosting performance.Invite you to add your learning (challenges, solutions) related to Queue system architectureSomeone will benefit by getting one step ahead in their journey to build Queue with Postgres.",

All the time.> that I won't get a ultra fat comp since this is contract and without the bonus that full-time get it's not gonna be a crazy numberThis is ass-backwards. As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.Unlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that \"it gets better when we're done\". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.All this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.This recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit. Read below for details, and Google for employee vs contractor tax calculators to work out what your break even rate should be.https://accountinginsights.org/irs-worker-classification-employee-vs-contractor/",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys.  So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.",

If you already loaded the data then generalising will be hard since you cannot programatically apply rules to columns anymore (unless you go back out of sql and generate the sql).

Layer on top of that with more lookups for cities if you want.The most advanced thing you can do is pay for an address API which will take your address as a string and then return where it thinks it is along with a confidence value. Anything below a certain confidence value you review.",

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.This may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.Taking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like \"what is the best client by premium\" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.Technically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.This is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

The \"terminal\" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the \"shell,\" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type \"ls\" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the \"ls\" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).SSH, \"Secure SHell,\" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.When devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\\*\\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\\* I'm simplifying a bit.

(google rock paper scissors, lizard, spock). then work through your code and see if you can make most of your code not care about which ruleset is used, and only the bits of code that need to print, process user input or select an AI move should be aware of it.none of these things are needed, your code runs. But these sort of things can be fun things to add to your code so you can make it more complicated. (which means you can learn from it)",

I particular like that you didn't fall into the trap that I see a lot of new programmers fall into where they list out _every_ possibility in 9 separate different `if` branches. Instead, you realize that there are only three possibilities: The user is the same as computer (a tie), the user is an explicitly _losing_ combo, or the user is an explicitly _winning_ combo. If you have a check to see if user loses, and a check to see if user ties, and _neither of those passes_, then the user can _only_ have won!Have you heard of something called a Python Dictionary? It looks a little something like this:```my_dict = { some_property: 'some value' }```The cool part is that you can access properties in that dictionary just like in an array: `printf(f\" {my_dict[some_property]}\") # \"some value\"`. If you make a dictionary of one of the non-tie options (i.e., either win or lose), can you think of a way to make the logic of your RPS even simpler?",

Syntax is not as complicated once you learn it. I think the key is small problems, not projects. Something like a small math simulation. My favorite was modelling the \"sick hobbits\" problem: \"There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?\"Once implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.Building programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.I'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures). I busted leetcode out recently to help learn Python. I don't think leetcode easy problems are necessarily the best or the most interesting; but if you can't find or come up with similar problems to the 'hobbits' problem above, then leetcode could have some decent ones for training/learning.",

I say that, because I think the answer is use AI, and I have history to support my claim.I started programming before the internet, and the ONLY documentation was paper. Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.Then HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like \"What you can't remember that api?\". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.Next came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said \"You don't already know that? You have to look it up?\". Again, outdistanced soon.I'm sure you get the pattern. AI is the next documentation tool. This time the \"example\" code it provides is even closer to what you need. It's not right, often, but it's close, and sometimes it has an approach you had not even considered. The nay-sayers will be left behind again. Use the tools, use the technology. Give yourself every advantage you can find, it's not lazy, it's not being ignorant, it's progress. In 50 years of programming, it's always been this way. You either keep up, or you become unmarketable.You still have to learn more on your own, but boring api, or programming patterns is not where you win. Learn the theory, WHY is this way better than that. What is the benefit of this way or that way, and the chat bots can help with this learning too. That's where you will outshine your competition.",

So in Python you expose a web server using something like Flask, which when queried with a web browser serves a file containing HTML depending on the route (path in browser) and method (GET, POST, etc). The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the \"backend\" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end. React, Vue, Angular, (Ember if you're old), or more raw JQuery, are tools/frameworks to help you do that.Probably about a third of all the programming information on the Internet is about how to do this, how to get started in it, etc.",

You can run Spring with Java, or Kotlin. I recommend getting into Kotlin. It's somewhere between Java and Python where it's a lot less boilerplate-heavy than Java while also being a lot more secure than Python.

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this: print('HelloHello, world!')This can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. Once you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.OK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. OP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.I don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.As an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.Why is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.Programming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.Having said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.My minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.If one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.Don't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning. If all you can do is sling around some design patterns, then unfortunately quite soon you may become obsolete.

Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.Example: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake \"learning days\". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.I think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.Many will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!They are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

When the feelings of frustration and anger arise, let them just wash over you, but don't leave. Know them for what they are: mere emotions. You are greater and stronger than your feelings. You can persevere, your ability to find the solution is always just on the other side of a veil of confusion. Stick it out, calm your breathing and master your emotions. Once the timer has finished, get up from your desk, even if you have begun to make progress, or may now even \"want\" to continue programming again. It doesn't matter. Stand up, go to a window and let your gaze extend as far to the horizon as you possibly can. Do this for 1-2 minutes, again, timed! Set an alarm, because we are absolutely miserable at being objective with regards to time. :grinning_squinting_face: Then immediately go back to your desk, resume where you left off and work for the given amount of time. Again: set a project timer for a little longer than you may be comfortable; stand and shift your gaze to the horizon; return to project; repeat as often as you need. Try performing the routine religiously, our brains and bodies love little routines and procedures. After a couple days, try to increase the amount of time. Gradually you will discover that your ability to push through negativity will grow, and your ability to discover and map out solutions will become robust and powerful.

You need to decompose the problem recursively until you arrive at lots of small problems with trivial solutions.2) Just go and implement it. If you don’t know how to do something in a given language, google it and you’ll be fine.I’m working on my chess engine right now, and this process has made a problem with no obvious solution (at a glance) decently easy to solve. The important thing is to start with something very small, and with each project you make something bigger. You wouldn’t go to the gym and lift something ridiculously heavy on your first day, you need to build up to it.Also, good luck with university! I’m taking a gap year after I’m done with my school, so I will be starting uni in 2027 :)",

Having a problem to solve, understanding the requirements, and partitioning the solution into manageable chunks are some of the more difficult tasks when participating in any project. Right now, though, programming seems like the hard part, because it's still new. Over time, and with practice, you'll begin to develop the fluency you need to confidently express your ideas in code. Like learning to ride a bicycle, one day it's all just going to *click* and you're not even going to realize it's happened until you're cruising.You still have a lot more to learn in CS, and it's probably going to get harder before it gets easier. Use that to your advantage! Take everything you learn as an opportunity to practice writing code. Way back when I was in college, I wrote my own collection of all the data structures and algorithms I learned; reinventing the wheel not only helped me to better understand what I was learning, but it gave me lots of practice. Just keep at it, stay positive, and be curious. You got this!",

Make a short note of what your code does or try explaining to yourself why you wrote a particular piece of code. If you feel stuck, use Google. Look up errors, logic, syntax and even read documentation to understand which function you can use. Invest more time practicing, it will get better.",

How to think about problems and what tools you need to reach for.At first I just did this, then still had problems so I went cold turkey for every. And this solved my problem. This for me removed the dependence. No need to panic when I'm not sure or struggling with next steps. This part probably will be harder that the first one. Stick with it, it'll help.It'll take some effort but there is an upside. You'd be surprised at how quickly it comes back. Your body and brain knew how to do it before, so relearning will be easier.TLDR: add daily/recurring programing time with no AI to hellp you build back the skills, also cut all AI use from other programming time, this addresses the dependence.",

Whichever editor you choose though, just make sure to record whatever config setup you end up with so you can easily spin it up again in the future (e.g. dotfiles repo). Between the two I prefer neovim, but that's mainly because of the kickstart project that provides a neat baseline config. Me personally I stick to vscode with the vscodevim plugin most of the time.

Its a continual gradual process that takes years and as soon as i took a break, a lot of the specific details started to fade. Its challenging but can also be enjoyable. When I was in it, and something I was working on did what it was suppose to do and all the pieces worked. That was exhilarating. Not everybody is like that though. Maybe for others, its no big deal and it starts to make sense right away but it didnt for me. Id definitely give it a shot if I was you.

If you're spending a bunch of time learning a little bit about a lot of different languages, then you'll never build up your depth. Pick one language to really focus on, and then you'll discover that the other languages will naturally come easier over time, as you make connections.2. In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time. You'll find that once you do something five or ten times, you have a *way* deeper understanding than you thought you did after you only did it once.",

So your goal, if you want to make a living, is to get good enough to do the stuff that is too hard for AI to do (well).Can you get to that skill level without university? Sure, if you're motivated and intelligent and want to put a lot of hours in. University is still the most straightforward way though. But if you're driven to work really hard and put in a lot of hours learning, you can self-teach. Getting hired is harder, but if you've got motivation and a good work ethic you can do it.",

Week 3 drags on & on about sorting algorithms and complexity which is simply not needed when you’re trying to learn the absolute basics (like syntax). You can learn that later on.The Harvard lectures are also extremely lengthy, like they would be in college. The take an hour to say what you could summarize in a few paragraphs of a book.Try Scrimba, it’s more bite sized & modern. You watch 5 minutes then immediately code. Same for Boot.dev, it’s gamified.

This was something I was worried about when I first started my journey, with such a huge switch in professions. It was hard and kept thinking that I am not cut out for this but I persevered through it and I couldn’t be happier. This is a huge shift from what you did to this, so yes it is going to be rough but sticking it out will be worth it if you’re already starting to enjoy it. From what I gathered CS50 course is hard depending on the person but it has a great amount of info and goes into depth about important topics. So if you can I would say keep trying and if you don’t get something, then take some extra time to look it up and find more information about it. I also had a kid during my undergrad so I feel you on the struggling portion. Keep it up, you got this!",

Part of learning it isn't just acquiring raw knowledge, but also training and conditioning your brain to be able to do decently hard abstract mental work for long periods of time.Think about it like someone who has been a sedentary office worker who comes home each night and plops in front of the TV and can barely walk a mile without getting winded suddenly trying to move into one of the more physically strenuous trades. Hell, even for some of the lighter trades just being on his feet for 8+ hours a day might seem unbearable to him!But he definitely could (assuming he's got no physical disabilities) condition himself to the work eventually. He'll get stronger and have more endurance and get used to using his body to work all day - if he's motivated enough and doesn't just quit a week in.So I don't think you need passion, but you *do* need motivation - there's going to be a lot of hard mental work ahead if you want to eventually turn it into a career, so you gotta have a strong desire pushing you through.That being said, if it isn't a passion there's probably other jobs that take about the same amount of time to become employable like accounting or paralegal and which probably are easier to get jobs in these days.",

This means: 1. Once you've written code, decide if it is right, a good solution to the problem, a good example. If not, check it into the version control system, then iterate on it.2. If your code has a bug, fix the bug, then figure out how and why you made the bug. Decide how to change your practices so that you reduce the chance of similar bugs in the future.3. Compare your code, without ego, to others' code. Compare approaches. Decide what works best. 4. When making a decision or a trade-off (for example to make a function static or not, or to use a particular data structure), explain to yourself why you are making the decision that way. Consider adding that as a content. 5. When you change your mind about a decision or trade off, figure out if you're doing it because (a) the requirements/constraints changed, or whether you just had incomplete information, or (b) you made the weren't decision at first. If (b), think about how to make a better decision next time. 6. Look for opportunities to collaborate with other thoughtful programmers. Ask for feedback. Think about it when you get it. 7. Extend these ideas of feedback and improvement to the other activities too - design, documentation, architecture, and so on. Even choice of language. 8. Read code. Read books. Compare to your own work and experience. Iterate: observe, consider, adapt, repeat.Basically, improve your skills by practice, evaluation, and iteration. Practice alone won't get you there - you have to do enough thinking to get as much benefit as possible out of every learning experience.",

Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like: line = \"\" repeat for numbers of spaces line = line + \" \" repeat for numbers of o line = line + \"*\" print lineBut to be more concise, we could write as well: line = repeat(\" \", number of spaces) + repeat(\"o\", number of o) print linewhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than line = \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)or even: print \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)Now how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's: Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)To really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.From your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be for I in range(0, max_line - 1) num_spaces = I + 1 num_o = max_line - I - 1 print (\" \".repeat(num_spaces) + \"o\".repeat(num_o) or for I in range(0, max_line - 1) print (\" \".repeat(I+1) + \"o\".repeat(max_line - I - 1) Anyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.It the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.And yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced.

And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.My experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...I studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of \"questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam\". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).Before I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (\"love\") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?By doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!And by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / \"soul\" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (\"background-process\"-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)A bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts.

However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.So your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even \"better\" than the clever single liner.",

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the \"perfect mathematical solution\" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.For this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.Now do the same for how many \"o\"s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....So in this situation I would say that the \"goold ol' C-style for loop\" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop: // Pretend that height comes from the user. let height = 4; // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \\n so that it looks // nicer inside the JS Console. let pyramid = \"\\n\"; let ohs = 1; for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { pyramid += \" \".repeat(spaces) + \"o\".repeat(ohs) + \"\\n\"; } console.log(pyramid);Some people won't like that style and will prefer a more \"functional\" or \"mathematically correct\" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less \"elegant\" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional \"mathematical\" style.",

When you understand it you will see more logic patterns what is fundametal for any kind of programming.For example your piramid can be see as how count spaces to zero.

It's all representation of something.If you're not great at math, I would still recommend reading the basics of boolean algebra and set theory because so much of programming is expressed in true, false, or, and, not etc. A few Wikipedia articles and YouTube videos.

        "body": "I have the following \"algorithm\" for reading a programming book:Step 1. Read through the book \"leisurely\". This is somewhere in between skimming and reading in detail. In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.Step 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what \"things\" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other \"what ifs\" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).After step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of \"todo list\" of sorts for what I actually need to \"actively do\" to learn that material \"for realsies\".Step 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.Suffice it to say that \"Step 3\" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a \"library\" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).For step 3 (\"implementations\") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes \"unfinishable\" for me in practice because I tend to write \"too many\" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little \"checklist\" to keep progress:\\[ \\] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\\[ \\] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\\[ \\] (146) \\*bar\\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \\* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" as synonyms for \"(\" and \")\" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\\[5\\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \\* \\[1 + 2\\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \\* (1 + 2).\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output....In my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a \"\\*\" mark to mean \"it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise\", \\*\\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \\*\\*\\* or more to mean it is an \"advanced\" exercise.The stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.These \"checklists\" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual \"stuff\" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE). If I'm following a book with chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. style then normally I'll name subfolders with the chapter number and the topic, e.g. ch3\\_pointers, ch4\\_memory\\_management, etc.",

C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.Beware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.Find a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book \"Effective C\" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).Then, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.If you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",

Especially when it comes to strings, arrays and \"objects\" and sending them between functions.C++ and C# are just two c-like languages, almost every modern language have a very similar syntax to C, including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Rust, Zig, Go, Dart, Swift and many others. So unless you stick entirely to Python you'll get to see the C syntax (pun intended).

I have also written custom tools for that for my code base and it was also quite useful, but it's a bit much.

Mostly these get answered in the course of reading, or I can go back later and investigate, ask someone, etc.If the codebase is big, then the first step is to browse around and make a sort of \"roadmap\" of how it's organized, by module, by class, etc. Then once that's done, the reading can be broken down into \"chunks\" of about 30min-1hr each. The maximum time I can concentrate on reading code at one stretch is probably 30 minutes. After that, a break is in order.",

One of the keys to programming and software design is learning how to break the big overall goal into smaller goals. Then solve those and get them working individually, then stitch them together. So for example if you want a stock analysis and trading platform, start by modeling the price of a stock at a given instance of time (a single bar, whether that's a day, an hour, a 5 minute interval, whatever it might be). Then build an overall history that accumulates those individual pieces, maybe give that the ability to calculate analyses like EMA, stochastics, or whatever. Then model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. Then build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. I'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin. Python would be fine for this if you're not planning to do real time analysis. If you want something that can analyze data in real time, you're looking at C, C++, Rust, Zig, or something else that's a systems level language. You don't need to start there, but that's where you'd want to aim to get.",

Companies generally aren't searching for people who know some obscure language. In the few cases where they are (like COBOL), they're looking for people with 30+ years of experience, not beginners.I think a better way to approach it might be to pick a part of the world that has a good tech scene, but is not as exciting and fast-paced. In the U.S. an example might be Minneapolis or Atlanta. Both cities have lots of software jobs but nothing like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or NYC. Look at job openings and see what languages, frameworks, tools, and specialties companies are looking for there.Since you're a CS major, an internship can be the best way to break in. Get an internship at a company doing something a little more niche and you'll suddenly be the top new grad hire for any company in that field.",

For Java, learn and completely understand the basics. Then learn Spring boot. Build something with spring boot. Then learn some front end. I'd recommend learning angular.

There are still a lot of jobs available, but the gold rush is over, at least for now. If you want to get into development, choose a language and framework and start building applications. Being able to create and deploy software is table stakes these days. Understand SOLID and basic software architecture. Understand SQL and relational database concepts. You should still be familiar with your data structures and algorithms, and having some experience working with LLMs is an excellent idea. And make sure you know how to deploy your apps to the cloud. A good portfolio site will show that you're familiar with all the concepts I list above. The bar is higher than it has been in the recent past, which I've seen catch many CS grads who didn't apply themselves off guard. That doesn't mean the bar is infinitely high, though. If you know your foundational skills and you have some experience building non-trivial applications, you should be able to find a way into the industry, although it might take some patience and persistence.

Your electrical background is actually a huge advantage. You already understand complex systems, troubleshooting, and working with detailed specifications. That kind of logical thinking translates really well to programming.The fact that you've already played around with TrueNAS, Linux, and Docker shows you're not starting from zero. Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.At Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.The ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove. A lot of great developers I know have adhd, that hyperfocus can be incredibly powerful for debugging and problem-solving.Feel free to reach out if you want to chat more about specific learning paths or what the job market looks like right now.

Definitely not too late at 29! That being said, the market for juniors is abysmal globally at the moment so it's going to require some serious hardware work and dedication to get that first job. Don't let that scare you off though, it can absolutely still be done.One piece of advice I can give on self-teaching (from an ADHDer as well) is pick ONE language and stick with it for learning. It absolutely does not matter which one you choose as long as it isn't completely obscure, or something like COBOL. The fundamental concepts are all the same in every language.I started with Ruby, learned C# through my first job, now work in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.I'd recommend you start with JavaScript (alongside HTML and CSS) as you can use those 3 to build interactive web pages and get immediate feedback and a sense of achievement, which is big when self-teaching, especially for ADHD folk. Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. For where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",

I completed a 2 year web dev program at an accredited college(I chose to do it online but I recommend in person if you can) and was able to qualify to apply for tech positions with the GOC. I’d recommend looking into some job postings and deciding if you can see yourself doing some different tech roles just to broaden your chances in the current job market.I second the Odin Project as a nice start but I’d also recommend looking into other courses that interest you on Udemy(never pay full price for these, they go on sale all the time!) or Coursera before you commit to paying into a degree.",

Your later courses in how operating systems work and what they do, data storage and structures, databases and data communication, compiler design, etc. will round out your education after which you will be far more valuable in secure application development, application architecture, data sciences and other tracks you are now considering. Think about a masters in those areas or an MBA if you want to raise money and start your own company. For now I would stay the course you are on.",

Sometimes when we’re constantly grinding or studying, we forget why we even liked it in the first place. One thing that helped me: stop chasing the “right field” or “perfect goal” for a while. Just mess around. Make dumb stuff for yourself. A mini tool, a weird game, something totally random, you enjoyed building that card game so that’s a that. You clearly like creative and logic-driven stuff. Follow that spark, not the pressure. your brain’s just asking for a break from pressure and a little fun. Give it that.

There is also Machine Learning and data science libraries for JavaScript like Tensorflow.js but Python is usually the better choice for anything Data Science-y.For freelancing, I feel like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are better options. There is always somebody looking to build a website, and you can also use these same technologies to make mobile apps and desktop apps.My recommendation? HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And then you can bring in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning. But that is if freelancing is a big deal to you, because web technologies are a big bulk of the freelancing market.

This has happened so many times I have lost count.And this is not old news. This happened to me just a few weeks ago on Windows 10 (still waiting to see if Windows 11 has the same brain fart). Now based on the down votes, obviously many here on learn programming are not creating one file coding examples, compile that code to executable and trying to run the executable just to see how it works. On a side note, that is exactly what you should be doing as it is a great way to learn how to program.I actually do this several times a day, exactly because this is a great way to learn new concepts. But on many occasions Windows Defender will block the executable that I create, claiming it is a virus.So, I find it really hard to believe code written by me, code compiled by me, an executable run by me is a virus, yet Windows Defender always has other ideas. Hence the reason I stand by my claim I doubt Windows Defender actually knows what it is doing. Since I am coding Win32 C/C++ I see at least a half dozen false positives a month.And like the boy who cried wolf, they are really annoying!",

It should be possible to sign the executable using that certificate.That would then mean the executable is then linked to the website, and the user can visit the site to make up their own mind as to whether the program is dubious or not. The anti-virus program could even manage a list of suspicious websites and warn the user when they download an executable attached to one of those sites.Problem solved, but of course the problem it would then generate; it would eliminate the need for AV software and that a lot of money not being spent on yearly license fees.",

A typical place to draw this line is at the edge of well defined objects in your domainLayers help you stick to solving for certain implementation problems related to a subset of the technology. Some common layers are- data store - data access or orm - domain or business logic- api- presentation What I've found is that the edge seems to be a bit wider in the presentation layer than what you want for the domain layer and to do that you sometimes want to inflate the boundary in the data access layer, but this can introduce problems with the domain layerA good compromise is to create summary types which you can refer to in the presentation layer without having to load entire objectsHappy to talk through this stuff.

As a dev I'd say about 90% of my work is researching patterns and approaches, finding the right library, figuring out the domain. LC is a great opportunity to practice that last 10% where it's just you and a code problem, not because the skill translates, but more the discipline to work through a problem, start to finish, figure out where it's weak and improve it.This doesn't mean it will make you a 10% better dev of course, you're likely already a pretty solid problemsolver, but it is not entirely worthless.",

Second, a lot of those people are successful programmers who are good at what they do, so in a sense, they're correct. You can be a good programmer and be bad at leetcode.I would say, though, that the reverse is far less likely. There are far more good programmers who are bad at leetcode than there are bad programmers who are good at leetcode. For interviewers, this is usually a good trade. Sure, the leetcode arbitrarily filters out some good talent, but it also effectively filters out bad talent. Not all, but most. A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. Programming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. But there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

You'll normally never it in personal computers, because it's much more expensive; but for certain critical applications, a company or agency may decide to pay extra for it. ECC guards against memory corruption due to spontaneous magnetic flips in the physical storage medium, mostly from background radiation. This is not limited to, but includes cosmic rays, for which reason spontaneous bit flip increases with altitude and is worst in satellites (as u/MediumRay said). And of course, if a bit has spontaneously flipped, that bit could represent a variable in a comparand, or for that matter an operand.How real is this problem as opposed to merely theoretical? Well, as I said, it's not enough of a problem to be worth fixing in personal computers, but still a concrete enough problem for there to be a manufacturing sector and a market for ECC RAM. People out there are paying a lot of money for this stuff, and probably for good reason. So in certain applications, it's a possibility real enough to pay money to mitigate.I don't think choice of language should be expected to have any effect. Ultimately an opcode is an opcode.

Now it's just a matter of finding a way to get your process to \"skip\" an instruction (possible attacks exist for that).In any case, this is why systems have multiple levels of security. Normally you shouldn't be running a program with enough privileges to change system files. And for the processes that do need such privileges, these should undergo a quite rigorous security review. If I saw such code in a security review I would give it a \"fail\" and say that the dead code needed to be removed.",

If you mean the order in which they are written, I can definitely see how they may be perceived as messy, though I feel this is very common with tailwind from my experience. There may be a tool that organizes the classes for you that I’m unaware of though. Or perhaps bootstrap just looks organized due to being comprised of pre-built components?Tailwind css is also mobile first, but I inverted the breakpoints to make it desktop-first because I had no plans on making the mobile version of the application.Yes I definitely use the mobile viewports. They’re especially very good on Firefox.Thank you!",

You do also need to install Git (there are a few of the lessons that are specifically about using Git) and Node.js if you do the full-stack JS stream (and I think even some of the Foundation lessons require you to run tests which depend on Node being installed). If you do the Ruby on Rails stream you will have to install Ruby and Rails. I think both streams require you install PostgreSQL.The course assumes a UNIX-like environment, so either Linux, macOS, or Windows + WSL, so if you're on Windows without WSL that might also be a little bit of an obstacle.",

        "body": "You don’t need a degree as the other commenter mentioned. The job market is fucked for people who have degrees too.Here’s what you need to do: 1.) Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. You should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. You will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. 5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. 6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.Bonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.First dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp. Paid $11,000 annually. I did it for a year, leveraged the experience on my resume and landed a $70k gig as a junior developer 8 months later.Edit: I don’t have a degree in CS. But I do have a bachelors in psychology. Which may or may not have helped my chances.",

I'm also in Toronto, also a front-end-biased full-stacker. There's a fair bit of meetups for JavaScript, front-end, web perf. Go to them. Be seen there. Meet folks, talk about stuff, try to learn and show all the cool stuff you're building. Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking. It will still pay well but you need to set expectations and be willing to find a smaller place to skill up. I got my start working in a creative advertising agency, then was able to pivot into software.Source: BA Psychology+bootcamp grad, worked in the industry for a decade now.",

People that enter the field only chasing the money often get frustrated and end up quitting.The only part that might feel is fast it's the fundamentals. That's was the case for me with Python. when I started, the first month flew by. Learning basic syntax, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, etc., felt quick and exciting because it was all new and I was highly motivated. Then I hit Object-Oriented Programming and realized that truly understanding things on a deeper level takes time and patience.So take it slow — and enjoy the ride!",

Then that’s pretty easy and doesn’t require you to understand much of what goes on under the hood.If you want to actually train models and understand what is going on under the hood, then that requires a decent grasp on college maths, stats, machine learning, and being comfortable reading research papers.I’d also give you a heads up that the approaches used by modern LLMs are very different to classical NLP methods. Deep learning and the transformer architecture have upended traditional approaches in many fields and this is a case where a textbook written even 5 years ago will be grossly out of date.",

A boolean is the most basic example of a flag, but there are alternatives. `SDL_Init` uses a technique where each individual bit in a larger block of data is used as a flagThis lets you group a load of related flags together in a compact block of memory. In the `SDL_Init` scenario, each bit (flag) corresponds to a subsystem you want to initialize.`SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)` passes a collection of bits where everything is off (`0`) except for the one bit that corresponds to the video system, therefore signalling that is the only thing you want to initialize.The main advantage of using bit flags over booleans in scenarios like this is that it gives people using the library a very convenient way to specify a combination of flags they want to enable. You use the bitwise operator `|`. Setting two bits to \"on\" looks like this: SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO)There's a guide to bit flags and how they're used in SDL's API design here: https://www.studyplan.dev/intro-to-programming/bitwise-operators",

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:```some_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);```Now this function call only says hello.This way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.Hope this explains it.

And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\\*x+2\\*y + 42\\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42.

        "body": "Sorry if this is not what you're looking for but here's a brief summary using C as an example because it is kinda the base and most other languages like java and python run by doing something with C.First, computers have CPUs, they are the things doing the instructions your code makes. Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler. CPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1. Assembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now. What you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.Python is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird. Sorry this is random and disorganized thoughts, please if you have questions ask me i like talking about this stuff if you couldn't already tell.",

And now you're left thinking ok ya I guess that's another option from IDEs and when I write code in C I write the file name and python I write the name python first.

I've been lucky enough to have good professors teach me where to start on these things, most CS majors don't get that, and it's completely valid to ask for more details on how these things work. Wanting to understand what you're doing isn't an ego problem, it's just called enjoying your field of study. This was a great question.

As a developer, the single biggest proof of competence is the code you write in public - either through your own projects or contributing to the existing code bases. To everyone's surprise, many of tools we use are open source and have their source code publicly available. If they are active projects, then there would be a lot \"issues\" raised on their respective repository. Good projects will often tag these issues accordingly by technology and the level of expertise that is required to solve the particular issue. The easiest one could be as simple as changing a part in documentation. These contributions are incentives as well. You will find programs which encourage these open source contributions. Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Outreach, MLH to name a few. They require you to contribute to their selected organization, and then submit a proposal. If it is accepted - you get a 2-3 months internship with the company along with a generous stipend. You can actually go to GSoC's website, and find past companies- and filter them by a technology. In your case just find web development stack. There is a ton of need for more open source contributors.",

I have a plan laid out for myself though, and itd be cool to have some people join me on my journey so we can keep each other motivated. Maybe even come together and build out a portfolio as a group.

If you just go into the gym and start throwing weights around, you might get a bit stronger, but you're likely to do a lot of things wrong, be inefficient with your time, and get injured. A (good) book on weightlifting can teach you principles, routines, and instructions for how to do exercises safely. But of course, if you *only* read and never set foot in the gym, merely reading won't get you stronger. It's when you combine the two—the principles and routines from books, and the practice from going to the gym—that you get good results.The same is true with programming. Read good books to learn the principles and techniques, and then build projects to get practice with those principles and techniques. In fact, some of the best tech books include a ton of exercises for you to do so you that get practice while you read.",

My method:When I learn a new language I do stuff like Edabit first, maybe two weeks of 1-3 hours a day, just working thru the difficulties. I move up to leetcode easy. The point is to exercise my very meager skill in the new lang with tiny, manageable problems.Later once I feel bored, or like I'm wasting time with the ease of the problems, or I want a greater challenge, really any negative dull non-transient feeling, I move onto building a very small program. Usually it solves an imaginary problem, but if I could do something I could conceivably use (still small!) I try to do that. This approach avoids Tutorial Hell, where you are stuck in analysis paralysis. Bite off small manageable pieces, increasing somewhat linearly in size but with variation in difficulty.You can ask me if you sense utility here and you'd like more guidance about the method.",

Note that the last type argument of a `Func` is the return type. So `Func` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`So instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:```Dictionary> handlers;void Init(){ handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA); handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);}void Handle(string value){ if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler)) { var output = handler(input) } throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));}private SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value A...}private SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value B...}```",

If you store it in a variable, you only have to change it in one place.A predicate is just the data type of a lambda expression that takes one parameter and returns type boolean.In this particular example it’s unlikely that you’ll ever need to change the predicate for testing if a number is greater than 10, but imagine you’re developing a game with an inventory system that can be filtered in different ways.

If you want to learn Web Development for example then I can say the Odin Project is a fantastic free resource. Almost everything I know about web programming I learned from the Odin Project. However, there is one important point you need to know when starting this journey. The motivation you feel right now will disappear, usually around the time when you can't solve some hard problem or can't fix a bug or you are trying for hours and don't get anywhere. Programming, especially once you can actually build cool Apps yourself can be very rewarding until it's not and you question why you even started. Just don't give up when you get to moments like that. Also don't let AI solve your problems. You might think you learned something if AI is doing the work but you actually didn't. If you gonna use AI then use it to ask questions about a concept you don't understand but don't vibe code your way to an app as you won't learn anything this way.",

Disclaimer: this is just my personal experience.What is really funny is that everyone assumes that physicists suck at coding. I have heard \"you're good for a physicist\" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read \"Clean Code\" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure. I think you need to feel the pain of being stuck and then digging yourself out of that hole.Sorry for the ramble, your post kinda resonated with me. Let me know what you think",

Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.Leadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. As for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

I think it’s either I jump ship now on my own terms or they make we walk the plank later.And to those that say that once you have FAANG your life is easy and your resume is set, tell that to the people laid off and still can’t find jobs. I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. I don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane. These kids who only graduated like 3-4 years after me are such sweats, they can solve these leetcode hards like it’s nothing. I can’t even pick an easy or medium question for them anymore.Sorry for the rant.",

It's not a reflection of your worth or abilities, the hiring process is just broken in a lot of ways.Something I've noticed works better than the traditional apply and pray approach is that you need stuff people can actually see and touch. Your GPA and internships are great but recruiters want to see what you can build. Even small projects on GitHub that solve real problems can make a huge difference.Also, have you considered bootcamps? I know it might seem like a step backward given your background, but sometimes the structured approach and job placement support is what breaks through. At Metana we've had people with CS degrees who just couldn't crack the interview process, and the hands-on training plus career support made all the difference.The other thing is, what specific roles are you targeting? Sometimes pivoting within tech (like from pure SWE to product management, technical sales, or developer relations) can open doors that weren't there before.Your education definitely wasn't wasted even if it feels that way right now. Those problem solving skills transfer to pretty much anything. But I get the frustration, job hunting is soul crushing.Take a breather if you need to, but don't give up just yet :) The market will turn around.",

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.But at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.All companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.Established companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.One thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future. You can consider stability and process, while also considering quick delivery. There's ***a lot*** of companies in-between the 2 extremes that highly value that kind of perspective.",

As you can imagine this was a vicious cycle that never really got any better until I left.Fortunately the beauty of remote work is that you can generally find a workplace that will accommodate you, especially if you don't live on the west coast and can take advantage of the time zone difference.edit: It's unfortunately very normal for some workplaces to be like that. My experiences with early morning people in management positions is that they tend to be pretty unreasonable and may go out of their way to sabotage you if you don't want to work on their schedule.",

Which basically means that you should see that your manager is consistently messaging you at 7:40, and you should be adjusting your entire life to make sure you get around to that more promptly.You have to make a judgement call on whether you think this company / your manager is like that too, and whether or not you care enough to do this sort of people pleasing.Also, if it doesn't feel \"painfully obvious\" on whether or not your manager / company is like that, you should just ask. \"Hey, you know those messages you send to me around 7:40? Do I need to get to those more promptly, or is they delay fine?\"Edit: I think there's a lot of over negativity in this comment section. Not saying that it's not warranted, as I said there are \"plenty of places / people out there...\", but no one should be paranoid about this stuff.",

        "body": "Hey, Im a Comp Eng major (1st year though), and I can relate to what youre saying. Let me give you my perspective. I think your questioning isnt only about software engineering itself. It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.As humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**Oh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?Answer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. So now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?But I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.In any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect. And if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.If its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you. Sooner or later, you will be gifted with new likes and will feel complete once again.",

Do some personal projects in the meantime to stay relevant and beef up the resume with recent accomplishments. Also, as far as resume goes, definitely make use of the AI tools out there to tailor it for each job and to use phrasing that the auto screens like. One tool I like is www.faangresume.ai, but there are tons. 2 years is not too long as long as you have a story and relevant continuing projects (which can be self directed). If it looks like you just got bored and left tech without anything going on, why would I hire you over the guy who has been working for the last 2 years?",

The visa applications weren’t filed by Microsoft directly. They were submitted on Microsoft’s behalf by Integreon Managed Solutions (India) Pvt.

Depending on the complexity of the company, it could take a solid year+ before a new hire is productive.A single bad hire can set project timelines back for ***years*** Their salary isn't a big issue, but the impact it has on the project could literally translate into millions.Not quite the same as the FTE grind, but I did college recruiting early on. My company flew me out to a couple campuses to serve as the SWE-interviewer. That gave me a lot of insight into what HR was looking for. Every college we recruited at had a quota, and that quoata was based on not only the qualifty of candidates, but also *retention* of that candidate. Lots of SWE's don't realize it.... but we're looking into you ***years later*** to get our own stats. If every student we hire from X University leaves after 1 year, we're gonna stop hiring from that University.",

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.I speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities. If you want to do it because you just like those cultures, go for it, but I wouldn't expect to get anything from a professional development perspective.",

You're not wasting that time, you're getting 6 months of work experience which will be invaluable on your resume.Sure, internships are supposed to be chances for you to learn, and it sounds like they're just throwing you in the deep end and expecting you to learn to swim. So I get why you're viewing the internship in a negative light.... but all these things can be massive positives when you think about how they look on your resume, and to a recruiter at your *next* employer. That's what this internship is about, helping you to get a job in the future.Experience like this should be pretty easy to spin as a major positive on your resume and during interviews. \"I was expected to write the entire implementation plan for the frontend build\" is a major accomplishment to talk about. As an intern, you were working independently and delivering work that benefitted the company. You wrote git issues yourself, getting experience in stuff that a lot of early-career full time SWE's don't. You don't need to go into details about the delays in code reviews, instead you can just emphasize that there *were* code reviews (sometimes). Being left to figure things out demonstrates that you have the ability to learn quickly and independently, and apply those learnings in a real work environment. That's a *major* green flag for a future employer.Even if you don't spin anything, the internship is still worth its weight in gold simply because it's professional work experience with a real company. Even if there's bad practices, no mentorship, no nothing. The name alone will put you ahead of most people. Don't leave that opportunity, unless you have another opportunity already lined up to replace it. Your new-grad-self will thank you.",

They are cheap labor meant to shovel bitch-work the other engineers don't want to or can't do.Your boss second-guessing you is going to happen your entire career. Sometimes they mean well, other times they are legitimately confused, and they may also be trying to fuck you over on purpose. Each of these is a learning experience, especially the last one. Take it from someone who met his first self-serving manager 10+ years into his career, the sooner you learn to defend yourself, the better off you'll be.Call out their catch-22s. Start following up verbal asks in writing (e.g., To recap today's standup, I am blocked on code review for this PR since yesterday.) and when they flip out on you, just attach all your written pings to the reply with a simple \"Hi boss, please see attached pings from last week.\" If their behavior continues, consider starting a relationship with your skip-level manager so you can copy them into any contentious or inappropriate feedback. Again, learning how to manage upwards is an incredibly valuable skill.Being assigned to write an entire implementation plan and then break it down into stories is fantastic experience, do NOT squander it. Most interns would kill for that sort of an opportunity, because this the stuff that you need to get promoted to senior.Many places suck with code reviews, and you being a team-of-one in your domain of expertise makes it so much worse.

Culture, food, easy travel (Schiphol LMAO) and so on are good things. Money, it may sound like a lot to make $200k a year, unless you live in Topeka Kansas the cost of living will make most of it balance out. Then it's family situation. If you have kids going to college, it's phenomenally expensive. Medical care too. Funny or strange taxes. And so on. The USA gives you more options and has much simpler bureaucracy than most of Europe. If you're young and restless as we say it's not a bad idea to work here for a few years. But long term today is not as clear to consider the USA is better even at more pay. Depending on what you want of course.I'm retiring in France in 3 years. Not French, and hopefully B2 French by then. I have often regretted not staying in Europe but back then options weren't as plentiful as here. Still aren't. Bottom line.

Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. If you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. So, my advice:- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews - Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA - Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away - Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k In general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. Edit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards.",

They might only have 2 weeks PTO, might be 100% in the office, might have a terrible company culture, are extremely low paying (less than 104k), etc.For others, it's great. They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.And a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.My main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.As for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.Compute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in. That's your COL increase.",

Relatedly, the less advance notice you give about challenges or slipping deliverables, the less they can plan around them. If you're eating a lot of cycles from a more experienced engineer, that also hurts productivity.Overall they are probably not treating you right and setting you up to succeed if they're verbalizing things in that way. But understanding where it's coming from can help you figure out what to prioritize, like1. Proactive documentation and communication about issues, especially if it's on a ticketing system like Jira. Document and get help, so you don't slow the team down.2. Think through and lay out all the assumptions, steps you've taken, etc. You want to minimize the time spent asking other people, if they're complaining about it. So make any questions and context clear and easy to follow.3. Consider what it would take to get you unblocked. Sometimes it's your entire premise is wrong, but sometimes a quick question is all it takes to get enough information to keep going.",

Depending on the place you're employed that may not be an option. IE if you're in a faang and they pay you a dump truck full of money every year that may not be an option for you. If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.But, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. For now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. When you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.Once youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs. It will take longer to recover the longer you push past them.",

If I had just blindly listened to this subreddit and bought into the idea that it'd be impossible to find another job, I would've been miserable. I would've had to keep that now-shitty job for god knows how long.People with my exact experience level were screaming on this subreddit about being unemployed for over a year. If this subreddit was my gauge for the market, I may as well have just ended it rather than started looking for another job.Instead, I just started job searching, market be damned. Was the search easy? Obviously not. But I still managed to line up an amazing job in just under 3 months.That's what you need to do. Stay employed, you need an income, but also start applying to other jobs. Once you line one up, you can quit. What you need to do is very straightforward.

Chronic pain issues, like what? Are you injured, is it just pain because you sit at a desk for 10 hours a day? Either way that's a physiotherapist/doctor issue. Depression would be a therapy thing, I imagine that it's linked to your health too. I'd be pretty sad too if I had to live with chronic pain. Don't worry about your girlfriend, if she's good for you she won't leave you because you lost your job.. but the caveat is that she might have a chat with you or *consider* leaving you because you're not willing to fix your situation. No woman in the world wants to play mother to their boyfriend (unless they're abused or manipulative). Either way, you're smart and driven enough to work in this industry I'm sure that wouldn't be the reason a good girl would leave you. But your depression and anxiety? it might contribute, not specifically because you have depression or anxiety, but because of what depression and anxiety can do to you and those around you. So you need to really lock in and get those things sorted. How? idk, therapy? but ask someone more qualified than me (probably a therapist lol). At the end of the day, no matter what job you pick you still have to pick a flavour of shit to eat. I've worked everything from warehousing, labouring, construction to office based engineering.. all are good and all can be shit. At the worst you could probably try a more \"chill\" job that pays less, like part time stocking shelves or something. Or maybe labouring outside (I loved the physical do what you're told-ness part). Just until you figure it out?",

They'd verbally tell you you're underperforming, and they'd work with you to improve your performance.The PIP is a last resort. It's not something managers give people right away at the first sign of poor performance. It's something managers give people they already plan to fire. It's a paper trail. That's the sole purpose of a PIP, to serve as a legal paper trail of poor performance so you can't claim the company wrongfully terminated you.You should absolutely start applying to other companies.One aside though... it sounds like you're blaming all of this on the fact that you're quiet, don't chit-chat, do your work, and leave. Are you sure that's the cause? I'm quiet, I don't chit-chat, I do my work, and I leave, but I've never had issues like this. I've had bad managers before, but it doesn't have anything to do with my introvertedness. Just ask yourself that question. If there was a deeper reason behind this PIP, figuring that out would benefit your career. Ignoring it, blaming your quietness, and carrying whatever trait got you fired with you the rest of your life will make your career very painful.",

I started applying to jobs the last few days in April once i learned my fed contract was coming to an end in mid May. I had around 5 serious interviews and ended up with two offers, the one I accepted i just started this week. It’s going to vary wildly and i consider myself pretty fortunate that this position was posted at the right time and the tech stack was right up my alley and fairly niche. I also studied like crazy for each interview and prepped according to reviews posted on Glassdoor. In my hunt, i found a lot of jobs that were hiring where one could “get by” while still applying. Think local/state government contracts as well as contracting for companies. Pay was fine, benefits sucked, but those seemed easiest to get. So the answer is, it depends. Not counting the BS applications i sent out after accepting this offer to keep unemployment, i was at 35 total. This position was the 11th i applied for.",

Each product manager has a different set of skills. Each product demands a different set of skills.There is inwards and outwards focused parts of the job. I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.You can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer. How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).Do you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?I will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.Gaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.Things like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth. Writing and art are both things that are very shareable and show passion. Being an amazing writer can be a great way of enhancing your (introvert focused) communication.Long and short though is that I wouldn't lie at all. I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.I'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",

At Slack, our most successful PM was an ex-engineer who would straight-up say, \"I don't know, let me find out\" in stakeholder meetings. That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. Your dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. The buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. Don't fake being someone else. The industry needs more thoughtful, technically-grounded PMs who ask hard questions rather than confident performers who can't actually ship anything.",

That is a way to make the WFH day worse than an office day.* Wake up at the same time as you would going to the office. It's tempting to wake up at like 9 AM. Don't.* Hooray! You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you \"simulate\" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.Extra goated golden bonus tip:* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time. So, after you work, you have to do less errands and you have more **really** free time",

        "body": "Following, as this exact same scenario unfolded for me over the last 10 years of my career, as I moved towards team leadership. It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. I feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. I do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next. Good luck OP and let me know if you have any questions. I was a team lead/engineering manager for several years at big banks, with 30 total YOE.",

But you need to push on and remind yourself that you’re doing this for your team.Under performers should be easy to spot - if an associate's deadlines are slipping or their deployments are shoddy/ causing issues - ask them to walk you through the task, since you recently were an engineer you should be able to easily tell where the holdups are. You can start by asking them where the holdups are and see what they say/ take it from there. The goal is two fold - teach/unblock and diagnose the situation (how unrealistic an ask vs how much of this was them)",

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.When an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.At least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.Doing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

CS grads don't come out ready for senior+ either they have tons of gaps in their knowledge base and experiences. You have to identify where your knowledge gaps are and go research each gap to fill it. All the information you need is available online for absolutely free, you can also pay for some relatively cheap books to help. System design is well written about and a lot of free content you can find to fill that gap. System design isn't even taught in most CS programs so if you're expecting that from a CS degree you'll be left wondering why they graduate students with so little system design knowledge. Most CS programs focus on theoretical foundations and DSA all of which you can learn for free online.",

        "body": "I was in similar position though pay wasnt as great. I worked in defense industry (think RTX, BAE, Lockheed matin). Made 90k with little bonus after 4 years. Company was losing projects and it seemed I was going to maintenance hell for some time. I jumped ship to make 120k+ with stock and good bonuses. It was 3 years of mental burnout from the start. I dont regret the money I made but I somewhat regret jumping ship due to mental breakdown.IM not saying the new job will suck but sometimes there is a thing about staying at a company that treats you well even if the work slows down a bit. It happens in many companies it's on you to decide whether it's worth it or not. For 136k base pay vs 150k base pay and the options you are getting, id stay at the job. Im sure it's getting boring but you know the work, you have more job security, the people likely love you. You get 2 fridays off a month (i've done 9/80 and I love it and wish I could go back to it). I dont like including bonuses as part of pay because they are not guaranteed and it's just used as a way to get you there. So really consider it as you only make an extra 14k. Is 14k worth travelling 4 hours, having to work 5 days a week every week, potentially losing work-life balance (this is a big one), etc. At your job I know it'sa bout 22% bonus, that's amazing, you are likely more guaranteed to get that 22% at your current job than your new job because they will take into account the years you have put in good work where the new job wont give you 30% the first year because the first year they likely are hoping you catch up. Theyll give you enough to be happy but I doubt it will be 30% and who knows how much they give you in followin gyears. I was told when I moved companies that Id get 10% raises and 20% bonuses almost every year. In year 1, they decided to not give raises to anybody due to market. Usually companies that give amazing bonuses are the first to give no bonuses on a down year.",

The key is being upfront about what you know and what you're eager to learn, rather than trying to oversell your experience.You're not really overqualified for mid-level positions - you're differently qualified, which can work in your favor if you frame it right. Focus on the problem-solving aspects, the full ownership you've taken of projects, and your ability to work independently, but also emphasize your excitement about learning team dynamics and industry standards. Many companies actually love hiring PhD holders because you bring analytical thinking and persistence that's hard to teach.

Keep a brag / conflict documentA work log is essentially for writing down what you do day to day, conversations you have, context you gather, and anything and everything so you can look back and see your growth over timeA brag / conflict document is two fold: Writing down big accomplishments that you'd brag about, and a conflict document is any issues that arise like bugs you introduce, conflicts with your manager or peers, etc. All of these will help you craft your resume in the future, and help you remember context for when you go to interview. It's a lot easier to look back and brush up on what happened during that huge project than go \"uhhhh yeah i built the thing over time and people were happy\".Congrats and good luck!",

        "body": "Congrats.Your first week is usually onboarding., depending on company you either talk to your manager to decide how you're first few weeks will look like or you take an onboarding course. It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.Before any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.Get your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.Sign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.As for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.Ask questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up. Edit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. Also find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there. Im talking about when someone has a report and they say \"OP helped me get past this issue\" or \"OP made an interesting observation\" at a certain point someone is going to say \"wow OP is making good contributions\" and someone might be like \"who is this OP everybody is talking about\".",

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.This is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.Instead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. Generally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.What you want to avoid is generic \"entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models\".Now, what can you do to enhance your resume:1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. 2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. 4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the \"under the hood\" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",

Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.So again, don't think \"well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD\", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.Instead, I would look for jobs where you can say \"typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this\", and those are the jobs you want to apply for. I think startups would also be a good place for someone like you vs. mega dino tech companies (and I say this as someone who works in a mega dino tech company).>Also, to be sure, what does llm powered application mean ? Does that mean how to work with and guide and direct llms to build and put together coding scripts and libraries with which to build apps ?That means a piece of software that uses API calls to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, whatever) to do stuff. You're not actually making contributions to the underlying LLM model, you're making a piece of software that uses an existing model. There is a spectrum too - there's stuff like RAG systems where you're not retraining the model per se, but you're adapting the model for your own application with your own data.",

Over-intellectualizing it will make you feel worse about it without any actionable outcomes.

Read some posts from people who had to job-hunt during the dot-com crash or the 2008 financial crisis. Most of the competent ones made it out OK, but it took them a while to get there.

It is a tiring, exhausting process but i still apply with hope in my heart to see if i can land a job which might get me out of these paradoxes in 2-3 years.

I graduated from my Bachelors about a year ago and I haven't really been job searching due to health reasons, but now am trying to start a serious job search (currently working in customer service). Located in Toronto, ON, trying to avoid relocating if possible.I've been doing some part-time freelance work for an app that a family member is developing, but besides that, all my internship experience is in DevOps or QA/Test. Ideally, I would love a Software Developer role but given my experience I'm also targeting Junior QA roles. Would also be happy to be in a DevOps role but I know Junior DevOps roles are more limited.I know I'm not an especially strong candidate- I don't really have any projects or a Github, so I'll also be trying to work on that but in the meantime this is what I've got! Would love to hear if there's anything that can be improved, especially regarding my bullet points. [https://imgur.com/a/Kq2QqfS](https://imgur.com/a/Kq2QqfS)",

If you are passionate about development, then you could go back get the bachelors, or go to a boot camp, or take free classes online.Once you have like 4-5 years experience people don’t really care about that. I think your problem, I’m sensing is that you are unsure of whether or not you want to do this for the rest of your life.That’s a bigger question than just getting a bachelors or not. For me it wasn’t a question, I always knew I wanted to do this type of work because everything else felt extremely boring to me. Even when I struggled I would take breaks, but I eventually always came back to programming because I just enjoyed it that much.I would still do this, even if no one paid me to do it.",

I think we're leaning towards the SWEs doing their own testing part of the cycle at the moment because people are being pushed to wear multiple hats with the job market as it is\\* Having QA-related roles on your resume can be very polarizing. Some managers believe that to be a huge plus, especially if you ever go back to SWE, because that indicates that you will test your own code along the way, and take testing into consideration when you plan anything. Others think that a SDET/SET is unable to code as well since they do QA along with other work. It's hard to say. \\* One more thing that comes to mind is that most places that have dedicated QA generally operate on inflexible timelines. If you're burning out, having those kind of hard deadlines (which can be hard to meet due to a whole host of reasons) might not be as pleasant as you expect.All that being said, and noting that a lot of that sounds negative, I personally enjoy it. Places that value quality will value the fact that you're bringing in perspective about testing that is often overlooked, especially when you're bringing these discussions to the table early instead of as an afterthought. I have been seeing some roles pop up on LinkedIn and otherwise, so I'd like to believe that as hiring picks up more of those roles will open up as companies flow back to having to build up quality around projects that have had minimal testing..",

To survive your current on call, try to look into the root cause of your pages. See if youc an try to fix the core issues so you're not getting hammered (or creating tickets and advocating your manager for people to work on it). Some pages tend to also just be noise, do you get a lot of pages that people say to just ignore?

That's just how it is.TL;DR find teams or companies with more mature products that do something like a 'follow the sun' approach to on-call. Less pings and less craziness for sure.",

They are all different so there is not one way to do it.I've only done it at one company, though im getting prepped to do it at my current job.My first company in FAANG was a major project with offices in US and India. So what theyd do is there was about different teams for every product in the project. My team had about 30-40 people in the US and about the saem in India and it rotated betrween each person. So I had to be on-call for aabout 12 hours once a month. At first it sucked because we had no automation at the time so every issue was hard to find and any customer issue had to get on a call with the customer for a few hours. It sucked. But then automation got better and dropped the amount of customer calls because issues were getting resolved before the customer realized it. Usually the issues in this on-call were onest that had to be resolved immediately.There was a 2nd on-call that lasted 3-4 days, this was for less serious issues that could wait a couple days to resolve. But people in this on0-call would get a lot because it was mostly minor issues. My current job, does weekly on-call but from what I hear we will get all types of incidents. But it's mostly to be owrked on during business hours unless it's a tier 1 issue which has to be worked on immediately. Thankfully my team is last line of defense so it's rare to hear that happen.",

Speaking to the process, I think 9/10 companies that interview you for a role and bait and switch like they have aren’t good companies to work for. What they should have done is clarified the job you were interviewing for before the first round and certainly by the second round. Clarifying the job you were interviewing for at the offer stage is scammy. There are situations where that could make a lot of sense for everyone but this doesn’t sound like that. I think the kind of company that does this is also the kind of company that says “we would like to give you a raise and we for sure will but we have to wait until next year”",

The key thing in my mind is to focus on salary, not level. If they pay you like a senior/staff/whatever, then fuck it. Take the money. Title aint shit without the money.I had a similar situation: I was hoping for staff engineer, but got a senior offer. I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well. Then later, at the offer stage when we talked about senior, I was clear \"Hey I started looking at these because of the salary band of this higher level - can we meet in the middle somewhere?\"There are obviously no guarantees, but that's how I played it. I hope it works out for you!",

I do have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth from it TBH as the staff and senior job rec is basically identical with the exception of a single line about years of experience, which I easily meet for the staff role. Fingers crossed I get more info on Monday. I was given the offer at the end of day Wednesday with no comp numbers and just an email from the recruiter outlining what I shared in my OP and a “we will talk about it on Monday”. I feel like after 5 rounds of interviews including an hour long presentation and a 4 hour panel, they should have given more info regarding the downgrade and not leave me hanging all weekend… but such is life.

It comes down to what you want out of it,.the actual program offered by the uni and the industry where you live.If you want to be creating new AI / ML algorithms or pushing the boundary further (effectively research) - most of those jobs exist in US / Europe (if you aren't there) and require PhD level research experience and significant output in research. It's also an intersection of computer science and maths. Most people here are more theoretically maths/stats heavy. Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.If you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.Most unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively \"create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research\". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.For your situation - You could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. The industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc. These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.The masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory... How hopfield neutral networks work , Monte Carlo etc work. Remember ML / AI is actually intersection of CS and Maths. So when you pick a uni program, make sure it has a balance of CS and Stats. If you really wanted to go deeper, your maths level will need to go deeper.",

        "body": "This gets asked like every other day, forget five years ago.ML is definitely \"saturated\", which means you should not pursue it because you think it'll make it easy to get a job, \"future proof\" your career or to make a quick buck (well, you can probably do the latter taking VC money for your \"AI\" company that's really a GPT wrapper). Are new masters graduates who actually like doing ML getting jobs? Absolutely. They do need to be from a \"top\" university, however. (PhD hiring is, as ever, less prestige-obsessed, but it's still pretty bad.)The tricky part for you is your level of experience. The typical ML masters new grad has 0-2 years of experience and should expect to be busted down to entry level. You should expect that, too, just with a faster promotion path. Whether that's acceptable to you is a different question.",

        "body": "Hey man.. Honestly, you're in a way better position than you think. QA automation and cybersecurity are actually huge advantages when transitioning to dev roles, not setbacks.The QA automation experience gives you testing mindset which most devs lack. You understand how to break code and think about edge cases. That's gold. Plus you've already written automation scripts so you're coding.Cybersecurity is even more valuable now. Every company needs devs who understand security, and with all the data breaches happening, having that background makes you stand out big time. You'll be the dev who actually knows about secure coding practices. At Metana we've had students transition from all kinds of backgrounds. QA, cybersecurity, even completely different fields. The key is showing you can build stuff and solve problems, which you're already doing.My advice would be to take the cybersecurity program but keep building projects on the side. Maybe focus on security-focused applications or tools. That way you're combining both skill sets and will be way more valuable than a regular dev. Also don't stress about being \"behind\". You're creating a unique skill combination that most devs don't have. That's actually gonna help you way more in the long run than just being another generic SWE.",

But you shouldn’t stay there.I’ve known people in my org who wanted to be SWEs and never got around to it and it’s clear their skill set is very much junior level when it comes to development work.You can always just apply to other jobs. You can utilize your school’s connections to industry past graduation. You should try to transition to a SWE job as soon as you’re able to. You don’t become less of a risk taker as you get older, if anything, you’re going to be more cautious with new life responsibilities coming in. Now is the time to make big changes. If you wait 10 years, you’re mentally less capable of learning new things from a neuroscience POV. It’s similar to how people lose language learning ability as they age.The job market isn’t nearly as bad as this subreddit makes it out to be. You’ll be okay as long as you’re at least the median CS student in skill.",
