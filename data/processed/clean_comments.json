As it was done before the MCP era, we basically need to provide knowledge base of SQL syntax, table metadata, and its question - SQL pair to make sure the gpt is not hallucinated. As the data warehouse itself is not neat as well, there was a need to preprocess the data first before we dump the data and the gpt can access it.it also need to be done on case by case basis, as we need to create examples per business use case and if there is a use case where complex analysis is required, good luck facing hallucination.as for the action part, it just become a fancy chat base wrapper to existing app that originally need to be manually operated by some teams.in the end, that project getting stale and become a data extractor for business team to get data that is not available in dashboard yet",

We have spent decades trying to build deterministic systems that give the right answer every time but effectively we are throwing a probabilistic system on top that will add to the error rate. Their expectation is that you one shot determine the correct answer every time and that's never going to happen no matter how much you tune it, add agents or whatever. The best you can do is reduce the error rate, but that takes some serious work with experienced people, not just something you get out of the box from some crap tool or whatever.Also the context of how the LLM got to that answer that it gives is often SQL and that's gibberish to most business users, so they can't even evaluate whether something that \"looks weird\" is actually correct or it's an obvious mistake in the SQL construction. Personally I think AI is great for tasks in which the user can evaluate the output from their knowledge like doc retrieval with links, coding assist, etc. But we are not at a point where we can blindly trust answers from AI.Kinda related, we had a call with a company that was offering some kind of vibe coding tool for data engineering. You feed it a bunch of context and it would build your pipelines with an agentic model (orchestrator/workers from what I could tell). I asked the question of how it could get to understand your source systems when the documentation is often lacking. They said the expectation was that you had full documentation for your systems that you could feed to the tool. I almost laughed because I have never actually seen that anywhere outside of maybe a small biz that only uses Salesforce or something.",

I haven’t done this myself yet, but something I hope to experiment with soon: build an MCP server that scans your metadata and samples the data so that it “understands your database”. You can then, in theory, hook that up to Copilot or some other LLM as the MCP host. There are probably good and bad ways of doing this, but it should in theory be doable. Someone on this sub recently posted that that they had successfully implemented this (I give this sub slightly more credence than LinkedIn lunatics).To those concerned about OP feeding private data to public LLMs: enterprise LLM products exist (ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, etc) and they typically have privacy/security guarantees, or so I’m told. This type of setup should only be used with those, obviously. All that being said, the most successful use case of such a setup would probably be the data team having more intelligent/aware AI coding assistants, eg using an agent to build you a pipeline that isn’t just guessing at your schemas. As for your stakeholder… I still don’t understand why some people think a fancy randomness machine will give better results than a simple SQL query, which is a straightforward and deterministic way to pull the data one needs.",

Go further into data science to give your dashboards more depth. But for “frontend data engineering”, as i call it, the data is all there, but you’re just finding the data with optimized queries and transforming and loading into a dashboard or whatever. For some, that’s enjoyable. For me, not so much. Then “backend data engineering” is more storage, modeling, and infrastructure. You can def up skill with tools like spark and airflow to automate some of those processes. Those skills def transfer to “backend” data engineering a bit more. Also, use Python.",

Same for DEs: they write code and design systems to solve data problems. Analyzing data and working with business requirements around data systems is also part of it. Creating reports can also be part of it (although that’s more of a data analyst thing in my opinion).Generally you will find multiple different realms of data engineering when looking for jobs. To me it sounds like you need to be more specific with yourself about what exactly it is that you are interested in within DE (is it writing Spark ETL jobs? Is it writing SQL pipelines? Is it working with Kafka/streaming systems?) and then filter your job search based on that.",

I don’t have a good explanation for you other than the market is warming up and bigger companies are willing to bet on junior talent. But smaller companies still won’t generally is what I see anyway. Data engineering is hard - we can’t afford the risk of bringing on too junior people so we want proven experience.I think my only advice for you is even if you are able to job hop like you seem to be, I think it’s wise to spend your first years of your career building solid skills from solid experiences. And you won’t get those in four months at a place. If I were to look at your resume I would be worried about your intentions if I saw that you had changed jobs three times in a year.",

You’re getting exactly what changed, straight from the DB’s transaction log, with no table locking, no SELECT \\* FROM hell, and no risk of missing updates between batches.But just because CDC is real-time doesn’t mean your *pipeline* has to be. For example, at Estuary we separate the extraction from the delivery. So even though we pull changes instantly from the source, we can hold them in our internal buffer (cheap object storage) and forward them downstream however you want, hourly, daily, whatever. That gives you the performance and safety of CDC without forcing a real-time architecture where it’s not needed.So yeah, real-time extraction doesn’t mean real-time everything. But CDC at the source is non-negotiable if you care about correctness.It also lets us backfill history or debug weird usage spikes by looking at the full change stream. it's absolutely worth it.",

        "body": "You need to see every state change.Take a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.Alternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.All sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.You might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.Doing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?---Speed / latency and flexibilityIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.You don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.---Efficiency with actual slow changesIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.If your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%---Automation and concurrent usesCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.If the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.--- CaveatIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.In any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",

If you group your dimension calculation definition along with its query SQL and table joined into a single definition, you have a semantic model. Is it a logic table? Yes, in the end, it's a logic table persisted in your database. Since the logic table is defined in a formatted way, it gives extra meaning for your LLM model to inference.

If you want to apply for jobs, do it while you have a job.Also it’s not that they see you as “so stupid” it’s that if they can choose someone who has done data engineering vs someone who hasn’t, of course they will choose someone who’s done it before. The reality is certs and personal projects only teach you the tools, the core learning of DE is done on the job, in how you solve the real problems that come up. How you compromise between stakeholder needs and technical constraints, how you interpret vague requirements, how you anticipate (or don’t) a future data structure for a data source that hasn’t begun coming through yet.Curious your numbers as well. Last time I was laid off about 3 years ago, I was unemployed for 1.5 years while searching, took just over 500 applications before landing a role, and I had 3 years of DE experience and 12 years of full stack dev experience at big companies (ones whose names anyone in the US would recognize F500 or equivalent non-publicly traded).",

You grow into it through an Data Analyst -> Analytical Engineer pathway or Software Engineer -> Data Engineer pathway.That being said, it is very tough for juniors now. I can sympathise with you, but you may need to bite the bullet and go back into analytics, start inching your way towards engineering, change titles, then look for jobs.",

Might want a separate file for each job.Look into medallion architecture. Bronze jobs are mostly for reading from data sources with a checkpoint file so you can pick up where you left off. Bronze tables just exist as a raw source of truth. Maybe you split one raw table into others for different kinds of messages, but you don't really process the data. In silver, you deduplicate, normalize, and clean the data. Then, you may have some \"gold\" table or views at the end which are heavily joined, denormalized (i.e. \"read optimized\") for consumption by dashboards or BI.I've jumped into situations where people didn't understand the medalion pattern and it led to some poor design choices that created confusion and difficulty.Learn how to check those .py style notebooks into version control.

Less hectic, less firefighting and in general more stable environment. But this is just my situation.Edit : Here im a dataops guy. so i do backend , infra as well as data",

        "body": "I might be outside of your target for the thread but I was a C# dev for 10+ years who stumbled into a classic SQL Server data warehouse via a Power BI migration in 2016. I then took the leap into cloud native data engineering in 2021Instead of slowly making the transition and building alongside a team that knew what they were doing I ended up a tech lead by the end of 2022. IMO this never should have happened and I ended up stepping back to senior. This has hurt me in some respects trying to find my next role but that's off topicWith no awareness of cloud tooling I originally built a skillset in SSIS. Weirdly - maybe due to the fact that I was still largely a dev day to day - nobody would give me the time of day when I tried to find roles in that area from like 2018 onwards. I largely credit COVID/full remote/zero interest rates and the explosion of hiring for even getting interviews for cloud native jobs as my dev job never had cloud native options. I still wonder if I'd have even broken into the field at all without thatAs to how I'm managing - I've really been on the \"learn outside of work to the point of burnout\" trail for the last 3 years. I was a SQL heavy dev so no issues there but I still don't think I know enough about anything else. This gets more complicated because my current role is analytics for security teams so I'm also doing SIEM work and chasing security certifications...I always get by in my roles by being passable at things the teams I work in can't even get started. As a data engineer that's been teaching everyone Git, CI/CD, and infrastructure stuff, or in my current team doing actual security work in the SIEM/SOAR spaceI've written far too much but there's lots to share I guess.

Yes it was hours worked for free on the side, but the market was shit and I needed some experience.Eventually my utility in this role got too hard to ignore and I negotiated a role as \"data analytics engineer\", which was a role created for me. My salary negotiations actually netted me a loss in money, but I view it as a stepping stone.I know not everyone can do that, but I'm leveraging what little power I do/did have to hopefully get myself to a company that will actually pay me what I'm worth to do it now.As for how I managed, I was used to doing a ton of work on grad school outside of work, and I just took all the time I had been spending on that and applied it to making the data thing work.Yes it can be tedious and overwhelming, and I spend a LOT of time trying to prove how valuable my work can be, but coming from a job that is very difficult physically and emotionally, this shit is cake.",

I see that updating your business data once a day might be a bit slow, but wouldn't every, say 5min, be totally fine?In parallel you're mentioning metrics for system outages. From my point of view, those shouldn't be part of your CDC workflow, but rather in Monitoring system, e.g. Datadog. Could you elaborate here a bit, on what you envision here?",

        "body": "When bringing data into the cloud from onprem for migration start with:Data Acquisition: Be sure to drive data consistency verification on all datasets that are acquired. Use data factory for this if you can as its just a tick box. This guarantees your data is as expected. You can also capture rows counts in metadataData Translation: It is important to run audits at every point in this process as in nearly every migration, some data will fail to go through translation, or simply be incomplete at a source level leading to data incompatibility with new systems. To solve this, it has to be found in the original system, details and then agreed with the business. You can then write routines to determine all of the data that is affected this way and make that know to every before-hand.Data Cleansing: Often we are asked to fixed of patch data issues from the source data, this should always be avoided. But we know how the entirety of the project will be against you pushing best practice. If you do get forced to cleanse or transform any data you must have the business and project agree that this will break any ability to do data verification, and you can only therefore rely on counts of data and inference of 'completeness'You'll never get away with having a migration project that actually follows sense and logic, you will be the only person in the room arguing why transforming data in a migration is completely wrong, and you will be spoken to like you are the idiot in the room for it.You can only cover your back by making sure:* You get agreement for everything* You document every row of data that falls out of expectation at the source* Plan in multiple entire migration data runs leading up to the go live data* Never ever be quite about best practice. The conversations will make you want to quit, but never under any circumstances lose your integrity just because you're in a room of people who don't understand.",

The jargon removes ambiguity from the communication and speeds up the process.For example if I could say **”Define a function that takes a function as an argument and/or returns a functions”** or just say **”write a higher order function”****”Define a function that has a nested function that has access to variables in its enclosing scope”** or I can say **”use a closure”**Both of those alternatives are much more precise and succinct.Edit: I’m not saying don’t look stuff up. i am saying try to learn the jargon you can to be able to communicate precisely.",

Or the data is shifted left on accident from the source? Or it's a date type and you were expecting string & vice versa? Multiple excel tabs instead of 1 expected tab?Essentially my point is the folks creating the raw data that you then ingest as \"raw\" data in bronze layer are often times front desk staff who dont know what excel even is - there is huge variance. We can't reject every other row in real life, that data needs to be cleansed and ingested/used for x purpose(s) (because we pay for it, or responsibility to load it or whatever the use case is). What you've built is really cool, and teams out there would pay you big bucks to get this sort of pipeline operating efficiently, assuming you can course correct for the above scenarios.",

With flat pricing you do not pay for each query.If you're willing to self-host, then ClickHouse is excellent and may be a cheaper alternative. You can store all of the data in GCS or S3, saving a fair amount of money depending on the amount needed to transfer. (ClickHouse Cloud, which is also great, charges a bit more for storage then BigQuery, but may come out as cheaper than BQ depending on your use case — you need to do the math here.)40GB/day streaming is something you can do with a single, low-spec ClickHouse server without needing any clustering.

Data lakes and lakehousea are fine but also come with the small files problem. Also not mentioned here, how are you doing analytics. If you are reading 25tib of data and the end user can tolerate a lag in updates, maybe an analytics tool with its own datastore can cut costs. Other than that, others mentioned looking for partitions, you mentioned a lake house, limiting columns in the select is a good idea, anything to avoid full table scans. It might be a good idea to look at table size, analytics needs, and the number of bytes read v. number of bytes used in your worst queries. Set alarms for slot usage, query length, and bytes used too. If they trigger often and are well written, look at the queries and processes triggering the alarm.",

Here’s my 2 cents: - there’s always more generic SQL optimizations to be done (only select relevant columns, materialize often used tables, etc), but balance savings with engineering time required to understand ROI and total cost of a table/tool/feature- For BigQuery specifically (compared to e.g. Snowflake) the on demand tier is great for small-ish, partitioned queries, like those from a BI tool or certain ETL jobs. For the bigger ones use editions/slots/capacity pricing or whatever they call paying for a vCPU. Split these into different GCP projects with distinct pricing options (one for slots, one for on demand)- don’t reinvent the wheel with custom queries for monitoring usage and hacky dashboards for costs but use something like mastheaddata.com to get insight per consumer (e.g. Looked, Fivetran, dbt) and pricing optimizations per query.",

The companies that do throw in LeetCode problems are typically the big tech firms, some fintech companies, or startups trying to mimic Silicon Valley hiring practices, but even then it's not guaranteed.That said, you should still be prepared for some coding challenges, just not the classic \"reverse a binary tree\" nonsense. European data engineering interviews tend to favor real-world scenarios like writing SQL queries to solve business problems, designing data pipelines, or explaining how you'd handle data quality issues. The coding portions usually involve manipulating datasets, working with APIs, or demonstrating your understanding of data structures in a practical context. If you do encounter the occasional algorithmic question, it's often more forgiving and focused on problem-solving approach rather than memorizing optimal solutions. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot AI](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this pattern consistently - European data engineering interviews focus more on practical skills, though having a tool to help navigate any curveball questions can definitely give you confidence going in.",

If you run OSS locally (outside databricks) and test your application, and submit jobs in cluster mode, then the performance should be comparable to what you might expect in high concurrency mode. (Open a support ticket if not)Lately I've been unfortunate enough to work with Fabric notebooks on spark pools and they have a totally unrelated concept which is called \"high concurrency\" mode. Be careful while googling!!The reason high concurrency mode was important in databricks -at the time- was because the \"interactive\" clusters sent the driver of all jobs thru a dedicated driver node and it doesn't scale well when lots of jobs are running at the same time. My recollection was that there was deliberate synchronization performed, for the benefit of interactive scenarios involving human operators. In high concurrency mode they remove that self-inflicted performance bottleneck.",

Spark isn’t really optimized for tons of lightweight jobs running in parallel, it’s more batch-oriented by design.A few tips that might help: Use job clusters for isolation if you can afford the overhead, it’s easier to scale horizontally. Avoid over-provisioning the driver, more cores can actually slow it down due to task scheduling overhead. Consider Structured Streaming with trigger once if your pipeline fits, it’s surprisingly efficient for incremental loads. If you’re on Databricks, Workflows + Task orchestration + cluster pools can strike a good balance between throughput and manageability.",

Is the pay ceiling the same in both positions? Ultimately I’m not very money motivated, so keep that in mind. But for me it would depend on your current responsibilities. Do you feel like you’re empowered to grow technically in your current position? Do you feel stagnant or unhappy? Is there a possibility you might find yourself in a DE position naturally in your current team without taking such a drastic pay cut? Plenty of things to take into consideration, but I could see it being potentially reasonable for someone who feels “stuck” in a reporting specific role, etc.",

Typically organizations will have their own player ID keys, but unless you already have the mapping figured out, someone else's keys aren't helpful, and there's a new batch of rookies every year. So you end up with waterfall fuzzy matching logic which always has to end with some hard-coded exceptions that need to be regularly added to. This can happen with team names and abbreviations too - don't get me started on college football.Also timestamps. On an almost daily basis I need to select games on a particular day (in north america) via a UTC timestamp, which makes evening games look like they're on the following day if you just extract the date without converting the time zone.",

Some other comments here have covered it -- matching things by name or by address, rather than by concrete id values.Not only does it need a variety of fuzzy matching approaches, it also requires domain knowledge to understand what types of fuzzing can be used rather than just plain string distance. You want to know how to parse things like addresses or names into components, with different rules for different types of addresses/names. You want to figure out which aspects can be ignored or moved around, or can have specific changes.Even when you have it working well, it is still only 90%, and the last of it is always a continuous manual process of fixing things that didn't quite work, and your rule set just can't handle the subtleties that a person can manually implement.A great annoyance is the business looks at it and thinks 'this is easy for me to figure out, why can't you just write an algo for it? it should be easy' - not understanding how trying to implement all the nuance of human understanding is impossible.

True multi-master in Postgres is tricky, but most teams drop the fantasy of “writes everywhere” and run one write region with async logical replicas that can promote if the primary dies. If the execs really insist on concurrent writes both coasts, look at Citus for shard-level conflict handling or jump to CockroachDB/Yugabyte, which keep the Postgres wire protocol while baking in global consensus. Keep the hot 6–12 TB in the primary cluster, offload historical partitions to cheaper storage, and you sidestep the 87 TB headache. I’ve run Citus for sharding and Debezium for change capture, and DreamFactory sat in front to auto-expose the REST layer so the app didn’t need direct DB wirings. Postgres is the safer bet.",

Your instinct about Postgres being easier on the dev side is spot on the SQL compatibility makes the migration much smoother.But honestly, with 87TB of highly relational data and that schema structure you described, I'd lean towards Postgres here. few reasons: The relational nature of your order management system is gonna fight you every step of the way with Mongo. Sure, sharding comes easier but you'll end up with a mess trying to handle all those one-to-many relationships across collections. Plus your devs will hate life trying to rewrite all that logic.For active-active with Postgres, yeah its more work upfront but:\\- Citus handles the sharding pretty well for this scale\\- pglogical or BDR can handle the multi-master stuff \\- Your existing queries won't need major rewritesThe 15M users across US east/west is definitely doable with either but given your schema complexity I think you'll save months of dev time sticking with relational.One thing to watch out for tho - active-active with financial transaction data gets tricky with conflict resolution. Make sure you have a solid strategy for handling concurrent updates to the same order records across regions.What's your timeline looking like for this migration? That might influence which route makes more sense from a project management perspective Also curious about your read/write patterns are customers mostly reading their order history or do you have heavy write loads during peak ordering times?",

        "body": "Upfront disclosure - I work at MongoDB. But I’ll fully upvote every comment that says you’ll have to redevelop most backend code to use MongoDB. Fact! On the other hand - an Order Management use case is perfectly suited to the MongoDB document model. Your data is not highly relational; it is highly structured. A customer places orders, and orders contain items. That can be entirely achieved in a single collection with nested fields in MongoDB. The performance will be superior. There is rarely a need for transactions in MongoDB - use a flexible document to capture the reads atomically, and if you need to update other collections that contain values use change streams. Jumping across 87TB in relational tables is inherently less efficient. Going further, if you use MongoDB Atlas, I’d expect you can use the built in archive for a majority of the customer data (orders >6 months go to archive?), adding minimal latency degradation (+1-2s? Vs sub 100ms for hot data) and massive savings, with no added code. That could half the size of your cluster and costs. But at worst, for the near hundred TB of data, you are looking at a 25 shard cluster which would be active-active and could accept east/west geo-specific writesGoing even further, how does your order management support search? Atlas will provide you order search capability within the same cluster or with dedicated search nodes. And vector search. And all of this is Highly Available starting with 4 9s of uptime with options to increase to 5 9s. So if your C-Suite is weighing in with technical requirement (active-active) - my suggestion is ask them what the business requirement is - uptime, latency - and steer them back towards doing their jobs and letting you do yours ;). And ask them what value lucene search would provide to users? And then returning to the reason for you not to use MongoDB Atlas - you will have to refactor more code. But we do offer purpose built genAI refactoring solutions to help customers achieve this. DM me or check our website. End Users can even Experiment with “Relational Migrator” but you’ll need custom or some of our internal tooling to migrate 87 TB. Good luck!",

        "body": "I actually started as a fraud auditor, and later in my career led broader data analytics & data governance at a tech company so, have worn a few relevant hats here.I can't speak to the specifics related to banking & financial services, but I was in a similarly heavily regulated industry. This is definitely a very sensitive area and I think you are correct for erring on side of caution, since exfiltration or \"data leak\" risks could carry extreme repetitional risks for your company. Here are my general thoughts:- There are many procedures which do require PII. I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. - If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a \"free-for-all\" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. - I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. - You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. - There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. - On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? - Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. Just my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it? I could see the financial industry being a bit more sensitive than where I worked so, these controls might not be enough.",

Investigators opened a Citrix VDI that mounted the lake as a virtual drive; Excel worked, but copy/paste, local saves, and print were disabled. Row-level policies masked PANs to last-4 unless the user had the fraud role, and even they got an auto-expire token after 24 h. Every extract got watermarked with the ticket number so leaks were traceable.If your stack is mostly Databricks, hook the VDI to Delta Sharing or Power Query so analysts still build pivots. For quick looks, spin up a Squirrel SQL style web viewer that limits results to 10 k rows.I’ve tried Immuta and Privacera, but DreamFactory slots in nicely when you need to expose just a few masked endpoints to vendors without opening the whole lake.The safest move is to isolate Excel in a monitored sandbox instead of banning it.",

A Master’s can help, but only if it’s paired with project experience and real-world tools - that’s what hiring managers care about most.One option before jumping into a full MS is to build a public portfolio using tools like Datalayer, which gives you a Jupyter-style environment (with Claude and agent support) that’s great for building dashboards, pipelines, and ML experiments in one place. It’s also resume-friendly and much cheaper than tuition.If you're leaning toward school, look for programs with strong co-op/internship pipelines (like Northeastern, Georgia Tech’s OMSA, or UCSD’s MAS Data Science). But even short-term certs + a strong project repo can sometimes land you the job faster.P.S Have some blogs and github links around Jupyter (MCP and AI Agents) use cases.

For heavier processing that takes many hours/days typically you might look at Apache Sedona, a spark fork designed for geospatial processing. Based on your example though it sounds like you could probably get away with parquet files or some cheap cloud columnar DB implementation.We do similar stuff at the billions of rows scale (no geocoding though), with spatial indexing and location points on Snowflake.

If you limit yourself to one technology, you limit the positions you can potentially be hired to do. Also if you're really early on in your learning, you don't really have the perspective to know what makes a technology good or easy to use or not and your opinions on it might change once you see how you work with it in real world scenarios vs classroom/tutorial/personal project scenarios.",

While big data tools code base need more performant compiled languages, historically Java for Hadoop (and still for recent tools like Trino), but also Scala (Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink), and more recently, C++ (Databricks' Photon, Apache Arrow, DuckDB) or Rust (Apache DataFusion, Sail).If what you are interested in is high performance coding, then I guess the second job is what you'd prefer. Although my experience is in the first one, I think there are way more jobs in the tool user category than in the toolmaker category. But making those tools probably require quite advanced knowledge of performance, so you may succeed with specialization. This community is about DE, so you will get most of your answers from data engineers.What is your level of education, are you graduated in CS or already an experienced coder?For distributed system engineering, if you are into theory, I think a good starting point are the scientific articles that described the concepts behind the tools when they were still cutting edge research inside the laboratories. For example, those are articles from Google that served as a foundation for building Hadoop at Yahoo:- \"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters\" - Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Google, 2004- \"The Google File System\" - Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, Shun-Tak Leung, Google, 2003- \"Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data\" - Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Google, 2006There are likely more recent articles in the same vein.If you want to develop those tools, I would probably study the active open-source tools like Apache Spark, Trino, Apache DataFusion, DuckDB and Sail to understand the general designs and the hard problems. Then study the foundations of those problems, try to solve issues and submit PRs as training, and eventually try to get a job at those organizations.",

Breaking it into two distinct steps allows the database to first have a copy of the data that it has statistics about, and can do it as a single bulk operation. You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.Breaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.Having your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.Or, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.SQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",

The fundamentals, however, change very little—unless there’s a true paradigm shift. What really matters at the senior level is your ability to focus on people and process.At this point in my career, I spend far more time on change management, stakeholder alignment, and influence than on hands-on technical work.

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).With this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.Now let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...In the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.I don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",

In my experience, Databricks wins on cost once you're processing substantial data volumes, but Snowflake can be cheaper for smaller analytical workloads. Consider your data ingestion strategy, tools like Windsor.ai can streamline data feeds to any of these warehouses, giving you flexibility to switch platforms later without rebuilding connectors.Run a pilot on a subset of your current workloads to get real performance/cost metrics.

Once the process is on paper,  you can pass off the authority to do it and retain the responsibility for its outcome by asking to look it over before delivery. This should clear up some of your time week to week to begin to document more of your job and pass more of it off to others. The only way to improve your bus factor is to remove your hands from the critical path.",

See the old Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM) to do it easily, NSSM is open source and still used to this day on Windows stuff.We ended up using Prefect Cloud’s free version though since self-hosted was missing auth and we didn’t want to expose our instance to the internet, but heads up they recently changed pricing and now I think you need the Starter plan to do that? Could be wrong so double check me.They - like do many other companies - don’t seem to care much about Windows shops, no one ever does. Their docs didn’t have any of this in it whatsoever, all they mentioned was setting up a Linux daemon. Literally none of these companies ever care about Windows users.That was the best option I found.By the way, I’m a bootstrapped startup founder and love orchestrators, I’m deeply passionate about them, and I’m actually writing my own C# job orchestrator for dotnet. :relieved_face: check out [Didact](https://www.didact.dev) if you happen to use C#, releasing very soon.",

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.If not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.If I were you I would first answer these questions:- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?- How often is new data added to the data lake?- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?And then, Once you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

Drop the CSVs into a partitioned parquet or iceberg layout so each batch lives in its own folder; Streamlit can then pull just the files for the selected batch with polars/pyarrow, which loads way faster than spinning up DuckDB every click. Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code. I’ve used dbt for model builds and Superset for dashboards, while DreamFactory sat in front to expose quick REST endpoints for the same parquet files when we needed them in other services.

When you want to do internships in college, these are your people that will help you get in.For your situation, they are expecting the college students to have some knowledge and be able to complete some tasks. If I was the manger here, I would expect no actual work out of you, and that's not an insult.Things are going to move slowly, it just takes time to get your laptop, get setup, get access to everything. So while you are doing that, try to talk with the manager about specific, manageable tasks that he'd like you to work on. Then you can brush up whatever skills related to that.Talk with the college students, if any of them are smart, they'd take you under their wing so they can show they are friendly, collaborative, and a leader. If your manager doesn't have very specific work for you, try to get your college mentor to give you chunks of work.This is less developing technical skills and more training for the business environment, and that is just as important.",

If you need stricter schema and permissions, throw up Supabase or Postgres behind Appsmith; business users fill a simple form while you still query via SQL. For our vendor-format tracking we store element, subelement, status, and comments in Airtable, then run a nightly dbt job that syncs the base into the warehouse so every pipeline sees the latest approvals.

So I end up with the good data at the end but I have no way of testing if all the expected types are available, or build test on top of it.Also if I put the logic in the model it makes it harder for non tech people to add new elements.Also if I want some relation between the static records I kinda need to build multiple models and so the relation myself which complexity this a lot for a simple input list that are dependant to each other…. I’m kinda lost as you can see",

For example, we have a similar but less complicated case where we keep a dbt macro that is simply a dictionary of column name mappings. This dictionary macro gets called by other dbt macros so they can look up columns available in a source table and rename them appropriately.It seems like maybe you could do something similar with a dictionary where maybe you have an entry from 'Country1' and the value for that key is an array of approved fields. ...or another dictionary of fields for 'Country1' and the status you've given them?Then a higher-level macro could call your dictionary and say \"Ok, for 'Country1' I will loop through the approved columns and ingest them.\" Am I following you? Does something like that seem feasible for your case?",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys.  So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.",

Based on [this explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/6wilmr/comment/dm8blj7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I then got detoured into the researching pedantic questions like whether Java byte code is at the same level of abstraction as assembler (answer=yes, though its binary form is more comparable to machine code in that it doesn't use text mnemonic labels and the instruction set is for a virtual processor) [1].Google AI says that an app that is deployed as a docker image \"doesn't have direct access to the host OS's files, processes, or network configurations in the same way a natively installed application would.\" The ambiguity here is \"in the same way\", which pretty well makes the statement impossible to decipher. I hope that it allows access to `c:\\users\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py` or `c:\\cygwin64\\home\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py`?In any case, even though it took years, I now *can* access Anaconda at work, so the availability of PySpark provides much needed relief from the setting up of PySpark outside of Anaconda and integrating the two.**Notes****[1]** I also found it informative that *microcode* is at the level of abstraction of sequential state machines for digital circuits, according to Google AI.",

This would've saved you hours and can possibly save you hours in the future. The answer is yes, ofcourse you can add scripts, files and networking (it narively passes your own connection, so you can download packages within the container, but you simply copy files into the container). The whole point is that you can run your entire application inside of a container without the overhead of an entire VM, but with the flexibility of everyone 'using the same os'.For pyspark is also just skips the JAVA and SPARK environment variables because those are just already setup for you.If you ever need to host your applications using something like docker is highly advised anyways. There shouldn't be a barrier to installing docker. It's one of the essential applications in any orginization where code and hosting plays any role.

But it works.@OP, we’re using dbt-core with Synapse dedicated pool and ADO. When deploying to our integration environment, in addition to the docs output I mentioned above, we use pipeline tasks to upload our manifest.json and download it before the run so we can use state:modified. We don’t use —defer yet, but I think we will in our new (non-Synapse) environment. We’ve also started uploading run_results.json as well to support —retry (although we haven’t implemented it in the deployment pipelines yet.)",

If you already loaded the data then generalising will be hard since you cannot programatically apply rules to columns anymore (unless you go back out of sql and generate the sql).

Retain the original address string, regex the zipcode out (there's probably one some mad bastard wrote out there) into the zipcode column, take the rest of the string and dump it out into the street address column. You now have three columns: `original_address`, `street_address`, `zip_code`. Layer on top of that with more lookups for cities if you want.The most advanced thing you can do is pay for an address API which will take your address as a string and then return where it thinks it is along with a confidence value. Anything below a certain confidence value you review.",

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.This may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.Taking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like \"what is the best client by premium\" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.Technically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.This is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

Full disclosure, I have not touched AI. I did originally, in my naiveté, set out to learn AI and machine learning, for the same reasons as you. An article I read recommended learning Python, so I started there, and fell in love with programming. I'm on my second project, and have started learning SQL also. At this point I'm just not that interested in AI, but that may change in the future. It is challenging. I bit of a big hunk with my current project, and some obstacles have taken me a week or more to figure out, but, programming is solving problems, and that's what I love about it.

Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C, SQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours. > The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, **or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.**> Felleisen et al. give a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say \"Bad programming is easy. *Idiots* can learn it in 21 days, even if they are *dummies*.\"> Researchers (Bloom (1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it takes about **ten years** to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts.It's a marathon, not a sprint. As long as you're learning, you're achieving something. Keep going.",

This is especially true in your case because the response says \"their expectations\" which suggests that you're getting the information secondhand.They might have said the same thing even if there was nothing *wrong* with your code, but they had 10 applicants and one of them did slightly better than you, by whatever subjective criteria they're using to judge your code.As far as actual issues go: As already mentioned, you allow the player to spend more than 3 credits on a spin, which violates the spec. But more importantly, you made up a formula that increases the payout if the player spends more, and you did it in a way that would be a **big problem** if this were a real casino. With a wager of 3 credits, the house has a significant advantage (a player will lose 1.333 credits per play on average). But with the way you're calculating payouts, a player who wagers 6 credits or more has a positive expected return per play, so they can easily just bankrupt the casino by playing repeatedly.Also, this is a much smaller issue, but your test code in `SuccessfulGameTest` seems kind of sketchy to me. For one thing, I really don't like the structure of making all your test cases being dependent on running in a specific order, because it means you can't test them separately. For another, you're not *meaningfully* testing the final balance; if you start with 10000 credits and spend 800, then checking whether the final balance is >=800 tells you nothing about whether the payouts were correct.",

The most important part of your gambling game is the Reel logic, and you have no tests for that.* Your tests are kind of unusual. Most tests I see are self-contained at the method level. They set up a situation from scratch, they exercise the system, and they examine the result. Your test methods each run one part of a larger scenario. That's not necessarily wrong. It even comes across as readable and maybe is the best way to do it, but it did give me a \"huh?\" moment, which might be bad for an interview project.* The main logic of your game is, to me, oddly organized. You have a \"CreditStoreService,\" which is fine, but its interface is \"takes arbitrary logic to manipulate the balance.\" Why doesn't the credit store service just have deposit, withdraw, reset, and checkBalance methods? Why put the business logic of how to modify balances in the controllers and also the game service?* When a game is played, you simulate the result before checking whether the player was allowed to play. This has no side effects, so it's fine, but it struck me as odd.Still, all in all, a reasonably fine project. I don't see any obvious red flags. I'd probably let a project like this through the screening.",

I say that, because I think the answer is use AI, and I have history to support my claim.I started programming before the internet, and the ONLY documentation was paper. Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.Then HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like \"What you can't remember that api?\". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.Next came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said \"You don't already know that? You have to look it up?\". Again, outdistanced soon.I'm sure you get the pattern. AI is the next documentation tool. This time the \"example\" code it provides is even closer to what you need. It's not right, often, but it's close, and sometimes it has an approach you had not even considered. The nay-sayers will be left behind again. Use the tools, use the technology. Give yourself every advantage you can find, it's not lazy, it's not being ignorant, it's progress. In 50 years of programming, it's always been this way. You either keep up, or you become unmarketable.You still have to learn more on your own, but boring api, or programming patterns is not where you win. Learn the theory, WHY is this way better than that. What is the benefit of this way or that way, and the chat bots can help with this learning too. That's where you will outshine your competition.",

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great 2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \\*something\\* so that you can apply what you've learned.3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",

It starts with being able to truly understand a problem, explore multiple ways to solve it, and compare those options—thinking through tradeoffs, constraints, and implications.But technical ability alone isn’t enough. Great engineers can communicate complex ideas in simple terms. They adapt how they explain things depending on who they're speaking to and what the context is.I’ve been conducting interviews in Big Tech for a while now, and here's what I look for: when I present a problem, a strong candidate asks questions and engages in a real discussion about how to approach it. That back-and-forth tells me more about their ability than the actual coding exercise. In fact, in most cases, I’ve already made up my mind before they start writing code.

Like you somehow reach this magical point where you just get it and can code from scratch. It doesnt work that way. At least it didn't for me. Its a continual gradual process that takes years and as soon as i took a break, a lot of the specific details started to fade. Its challenging but can also be enjoyable. When I was in it, and something I was working on did what it was suppose to do and all the pieces worked. That was exhilarating. Not everybody is like that though. Maybe for others, its no big deal and it starts to make sense right away but it didnt for me. Id definitely give it a shot if I was you. If you can be consistent with it, you might be find it very rewarding. Now with ai tools, learning is much better too, if you get stuck, you can ask ai to explain it, something I didnt have when I did it. Good luck to you.",

I began on Coursera for free the PY4E.I know a few start with the CS50...but now is a whole different ball game with AI. I used to be an instructor in the Army so I'm pretty familiar with adult learning and how to get adults who \"think \" they know to actually learn. I say all this to say this...start with Dr. Barbara Oakley's Learning how to learn and them right into her version that integrates AI. These 2 courses alone have turbocharged my learning....so much so I entered a hackathon building agents using Python! So from 0 to 100 in 6months flat!

Hope it gets easier for you, and I'm certain it will if you ever get a chance to move out of your family's house.I feel the way forward for you is to research on which technology is most in demand for the location that you'll work in, then if that's also something you want to do, learn that.Consider moving out of your family's house when you earn enough as the emotional toll and abuses, and being able to not be in that toxic environment, will enable you to learn better or just avoid painful situations. Hopefully there will be minimal to no permanent harm done to you.Take note that we may end up working for a toxic workplace too and it's better to learn how to protect yourself, both in your family environment, workplace, and anywhere. Learn not to overthink and stay rooted and grounded in the physical world you're in. Trust your thoughts, emotions and gut feel, don't let others tell you poor or even dangerous advises.Consider doing internships to gain real work experiences, learn to sell yourself well on your resume, LinkedIn and in interviews.The best thing for you is learning how to protect yourself, and plan to move out of there or be away from them.and if you ever choose to get a life partner, be careful not to repeat the mistake of being with someone toxic. We tend to be attracted to who we find familiar, and children from toxic family, have a tendency to gravitate to toxic people too, even when they themselves aren't. Break that cycle.",

From your post i understood that your in a very tough situation! The major problem you have is 1.toxic family 2. Financial problem 3. & currently dont have a laptop! The first thing you have do is convince your parents to give your laptop back! Then you said your financial situation is very bad so you should do some part time job in any clothing store or any shop, you can try cafe or something like that! They will pay you enough to survive i think! Considering your 20 year old female i think it Will be very tough for you to leave your home just like that! If you can do that it will be very good but outside home in india as a lone girl finding suitable living place is very tough to get! You can live in your local hostel where College girls lives or something like that! So now you got your laptop & got a part time job & also found a shelter! Now the journey of coding begins! As you want to learn ai / ml or like this kind of things! But the thing is this very possible to learn but considering you situation you should first learn WEB DEVELOPMENT! Because it is a very suitable career path to enter the tech world & you can land a job very fast as a intern or junior web developer & you can learn 100% of it in Just 6-9 months! So how will you learn? For that there are many resources in YouTube & those are completely free! In my opinion you should learn from codewithharry's sigma web development course! There are also others resources like Freecodecamp etc but sigma web dev course will ne best for you bcz its in hindi! Thats all! If you have anymore quarry plz feel free to ask & Don't lose hope! Have faith in yourself you will be able to overcome any problem in your life!!",

In this case, the semicolon right after the if statement is technically valid code, but i tends the if statement entirely, so now we have a random opening brace with code inside of it that is entirely detached from the if statement, followed by an else which, because the if statement is already closed, has no if to go before it, and now the universe is out of whack, pants are now shirts and pineapple on pizza is the national favorite food choice until everything just falls over and explodes.Generally, the topmost error has the highest likelihood of giving you a clue what may have gone wrong.

It's to computer science what Apostol's Calculus is to math.SICP and HtDP do two things: they develop intuition, and they introduce you to some of the most foundational ways of thinking about programming.AI tools, code assistants, etc. are cool, and interactive platforms smooth the process, but the important thing isn't to write code itself. It's to develop new circuitry in your brain for thinking about computational problems (which you do by *the process* of writing code, which code assistance can skip, so you get the right answer, but don't develop the brain circuitry).I also find that (good) books, in general, go far more in depth and provide far more insight than most other mediums for learning, which tend to be shallow and focus on low hanging fruit. Even AI is going to be mostly low-hanging fruit, as it's basically a compilation of all the blogs and reddit posts and tutorials that are out there on the internet already.If you want something other than a book, CS50, which is basically (good) book quality in video format. Very rare.At the end of the day, technology has changed, but our brains have remained almost unchanged the same since the advent of modern computing. You can't cheat building up those circuits in your brain to develop new ways of thinking -- you need to learn, try, make mistakes, and learn again. I'm dubious as to the capability of new technologies to change that process that is so integral to our brain's biology.",

Newbies often think that learning to code means learning syntax. But that's really not the case.It'd be like assuming that you could learn to write poetry well by simply reading the dictionary.Once you have core skills moving to a new language is often quite simple. I recently learned Go (I'm mostly a JavaScript and Java developer) and it took me a weekend. Not because I'm amazing, but because the core skills I already have are all applicable to Go too. I just had to learn new Syntax (which a good cheat-sheet helps with anyhow) and work through the quirks.I'm far from a total wizard with Go, but I have written a pretty decent API server using Gorm easily. My point being, pick a language and just focus your efforts on going deep. Learn the core skills. Build actual useful things with it. And then, down the road, explore other languages if and when you need them. Which you choose is most often a practical choice based on how easy it is to do something in them, who else needs to work on the project, what is already in place, etc.",

There is just no way anyone can learn every field in IT, because it is just too big.With that in mind this would be my suggestion, take it for what's worth.If this was me, this what I would be doing:1. Take a look at different jobs that are going in your area, what is hot, what is not, what you like, what you don't like.2. Make a note of the skills listed in the Job Descriptions (JD) for all of these jobs. You'll notice these jobs can now be categorized into job groups, based on the skills required. These grouping will be based on things like languages/frameworks/technologies etc. There will be dozens of these job groups.3. Now based on what you learned in boot camp, pick a job group for which you think you have the most skills.4. Next identify the skills you don't have for that job group and go away and learn those skills to at least a basic level.Why do this? Because at the end that process you can confidently craft a resume that lists ever skill set required for the job group. That then means your resume has a better chance of getting through the vetting process should you apply.In summary, if you want to get a job in IT you'll need to make sure you have at least a basic understanding of every skill listed on the JD for the role for which you are applying.",

Then it turned out that I couldn't ever do the job of a senior computer programmer because of a brain disability. If you're interested in the details of my brain disability, read this GitHub issue I created seeking a workaround: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159406 :backhand_index_pointing_up_medium-light_skin_tone: Basically I can only handle codebases that I am not the designer and author of if that codebase has fewer than a (relatively small) number of lines of code in it. I got around this issue as a junior developer by having a senior developer tell me, for every task I had, which file or class the code fix needed to be made in. That being said, eventually the senior developer got tired of holding my hand and spoon feeding me and then I got fired. Eventually employers caught on. But yeah, in short, you could literally have a 4-year degree in Computer Science from MIT and then discover that you cannot work due to a very specific brain disability. Life's not fair.

That being said, I'm wondering how far you made it before getting stuck.Can you display a board? Can you fill the board with pieces? Can you click & drag to move? Can you enumerate legal moves? Can you have the engine play random moves against you? Can you detect checkmate?Realistically your \"stuck-ness\" sounds like analysis paralysis, not lack of programming ability. Thousands of talented programmers have worked on chess engines for decades and filled their own corner of the internet with a complicated repertoire, so its easy to understand how you might get stuck researching.I don't have a magic bullet to avoid analysis paralysis, but it helps me to understand the opportunity cost of time spent waffling about. I have learned that a bad plan is often better than none at all, so now I try quite hard to maintain progress.",

Make mistakes, recreate things that are already created. Don't expect that it will lead to greatness but it will help you understand why (in the case of libraries) some decisions were made. Likely you will (in some cases) run into the same constraints.For chess: why not make a chess board that lets you move a piece (and the board verifies your move is valid). that's an achievable goal. You can do it in text or using simple graphics. (graphics takes some learning but it is manageable if you set your goals low, like just load sprites for board and pieces. then displaying them in a grid. then if you cna make moves and if you make illegal moves it will stop you (just with 1 side of the pieces) you can start on taking turns with the opponent. At any of these stages you can ask for help, talk through your planned strategy. Don't literally build what people here / elsewhere tell you is 'the optimal' way to do it. You don't need to get a perfect solution , you are exercising your brain at the coding gym. It's good to get pointed in the right direction but it's important you do the work.We all feel like this. Especially at the start of a project because there are too many options. Once you start a project, the options become smaller and it will become easier to do steps forward. At some point you have removed enough unknowns for a specific problem that you have mental space to work on the problem at hand (isolated from the rest of the issues it becomes easier to think about). then you'll find you actually can work your way through it.There is a reason that in school you get given clearly defined problems with clear boundaries. It makes it very easy to focus on what you have to do. Build a datastructure that ... , build code that finds ... , etc. If you want to get a break from the high level things you can always go do some exercises but don't stick to them permanently.And when you see a tutorial, don't copy paste their solution but read it and then implement it yourself.",

A chess engine is no simple project.I can relate to the feeling of everything just feeling hacky, when merely plugging things together. Often that is, because one does not understand what exactly is happening on the lower levels of a thing. And if one was looking into that, then the actual project one was working on would be completely stalled.It can help to either do a very minimalistic project, or consciously say no to something like React and build things the traditional way, just rendering a few templates in Django. And if Django is too magical, you could go more minimalistic with something like Flask, or Falcon + Jinja2 + some database connector.Or you could go even more rudimentary and choose to do some coding puzzles. Like Project Euler, Advent of Code, or similar. Those allow you also to write beautiful code to solve problems elegantly. For example last year I did AoC with solutions developed to be purely FP.Or you could do something bog standard like \"write a blog in Django\" to get more familiar with it and make it feel less like magic.",

As you understand more you can write more tests. At this point every test you write should pass as you’ve made no changes. Now you can start refactoring the code. You can see how a list is initialized and say, “That is useless, you can just keep an empty list rather than a pre-initializated list” or vice versa, you can say, “You already have the initial list data in memory, it’s cheaper to use it than to regenerate it a second time”Then you verify the tests pass with your changes.

Your comments about your portfolio website suggest that you got stuck in a “I have to pick the right thing” loop, and that stalled progress… and I’m going to assume (rightly or wrongly) that a similar thing impacts other projects.If you’re anything like me… you start something, build up some good momentum, then reach a “decision point” where you’ve got multiple equally valid paths you could explore. At this point, you lose momentum, it stops being fun… and in your case, you move on to something that feels more fun again.For personal projects (and, many a time, even professional work), better to deliver *something* that isn’t quite right than to deliver nothing at all.If you accept that you might have to make big changes in the future (your “large front end revisions” you were avoiding), you can just pick something and see how it goes. If you like it, great… if not, you have another mini project ready for the future to redesign this to use some other design system (or whatever).Also, yeah, you’re going to have times when working 8 hours a day on coding leaves you not wanting to touch a keyboard when you get home.

While not easy, try to find a group of people with similar interest in coding, that don't just yap about how good they are but are genuinely interested and put effort, these people would motivate you just hearing about their work!

Every new programmer probably has an experience where they think “ohhh I don’t wanna make a whole method, I’ll just copy and paste this block”Then eventually they’re maintaining the same block in 5 places and they realize how nice it would be to only have to update one bit of code each time something changes.So anyway, embrace making bad code and learning from why bad code is bad!",

Small achievements should always be celebrated - especially when overcoming hurdles that have held you back a while.I'm a middle-aged hobbyist, and one of the things I've learned when pursuing other hobbies (Chinese, guitar, etc) is small steps. Good to have goals but need to crawl, walk and eventually run in that order.Most never get near to achieving their original goal because either their original goal was too ambitious and / or there is too large a gap between the effort and the end i.e. the amount of used guitars on sale when people realise that just learning to strum EAD chords takes approx 2 weeks of work.Glad to see another person presuming the time honoured text adventure (or in your case a CYOA). I too, have a number of goals that eventually included creating a MUD [multi-user dungeon]. I'm working on baby goals by first completing CS50x, then working ony simple RPG character generator.The key is simple: get the basic concepts  working, then expand. Can I do points allocation for stats and include out of bounds error checking? Great! Can I get player input for name including out of bounds error checking? Better! Can I expand upon that and create a banned name list ruleset, et al?Going in with lofty goals from the get-go, sees them cut down to size, and either the initial motivation disappears or one adjusts and creates smaller goals w/ a more realistic expectation.If the original motivation remains intact, and one can embrace and actively enjoys learning - and has a realistic timeframe - then go for it!Keep your CYOA - simpe, very simple - to start. Once you have the basic structure, good method to handle and track decisions, then think about expanding. All the best",

The part of the kernel that does this, is called the **scheduler**, and it is also responsible for running the different threads in a multithreaded process.The difference between concurrency and parallelism is very important. You can have a concurrent system that never runs anything in parallel...for example an event-driven system. A concurrent system *can* be parallel, but doesn't have to be.Also, bear in mind, that neither multithreading nor multiprocessing guarantee actual parallelism. They are a requirement for it, but it is absolutely possible to have a system that is concurrent, but not parallel, using either of those. For example, currently (as the GIL is still in place), a threading python program is multithreading, it is concurrent, but it is not parallel processing, as only one of those threads is allowed to run at any given time.",

It's more useful to know how you'd practically use concurrency.Generally, you can either pass messages between processes, or share memory.In the former case, you create a pipe between two different processes, and then send data from one to the other through the pipe. This is convenient, but there's a cost to it; the message itself must be copied and typically you'll have to make a system call to the operating system to do it. Still, it's great when you don't have much data to send or you need to compose different programs together and make them talk to each other (as in most command shells).In the latter case, there's the risk that two different threads will edit the same piece of data at the same time. To prevent this, you can use atomic operations and/or mutexes. An atomic operation is guaranteed by the language to make other threads wait to mess with the variable until you've finished reading or writing to it. A mutex is a lock that only allows one thread at a time to lock it. So, you can lock the mutex, mess with the variable, then when you're done, unlock it and let another thread do whatever it wants.",

I kinda think your lying tbh, if you aren't, then my guess is your not trying hard enough, might sound reductive. But I dont use that phrase lightly.",

Mind you, he had never even heard of the site before. I think this is just one of those things that is true of programming in general, regardless of where you learn it, and being resilient and willing to do your own research goes a very long way. Nobody is going to provide you 100% of everything, and that's true even of college courses, etc.I've also found that the AI chatbot the site provides is extremely helpful not only in guiding you towards the right answers, but also explaining the underlying concepts. I'll say that with the caveat that the other day, it set me off on completely the wrong path and I spent like three hours trying to write this whole crazy method that could've just been a for loop haha",

There's concepts in how to code, and what functions are available for use, that are routinely just not provided or mentioned as something available. I have issue with those basics being missing.It's like being given a pair of running shoes without any laces. If you've never seen them before, the shoe can be snug and usable for running, but it'll be very loose and not fit well. Versus if you know what laces are, you can figure out what you still need to really get the most of the tool and then use it to its maximum potential. This may sound like an obvious comparison, but I'm trying to show how some of the \"basics\" aren't being fully explained, and that leads to issues in comprehension later down the road.",

        "body": "It is a difficult question to answer, because, yes, programming IS mostly about plugging things together smartly, but the thing is, that that has always been the case!Way back in the 1940s, \"programming\" was about literally plugging computing equipment together in the order needed to run the calculations you wanted. The ENIAC computer was programmed by connecting wires between components that did addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, storage and so on!But of course that was very low level, and programming languages then came about, that did the job for you. You wrote \"A = B + C\" instead of plugging C and B into the addition-component, and the result into the A component.And as programming projects grew, you didn't write code for mathematical functions yourself, there were libraries for that, you write Math.sin(X) to calculate the sine value of X, you never write the lower level calculations yourself.When programmers repeat code, then instead write functions to reuse, and when those functions are needed a lot in every project, they become part of a shared library, or often the programming language itself. No one writes code to sort a list alphabetically, there's always a built in .sort function, that you don't even need to know how work.And when you write applications that look a lot like each other - say a web-interface to administer a database with users and their logins - you don't write the same code over and over, but do it once, and create a framework, or even easier, use a framework written by someone else! **But!** And this is the important part! - There's always something missing! The application you are working on will always need some feature that isn't in the framework, or library, or language, and then you have to write it yourself. You always have to \"dive down in between the cracks\" and write filler-code for that one thing or another. And also, to connect the components you still use very basic programming at the lowest level available in the language, variables, for-loops, if-statements and functions are still as important building blocks as they have ever been. So you won't get away from needing to understand basic coding - but mostly you don't have to write very much from scratch, you almost always build on something existing!",

Sometimes you're plugging together things that you wrote, sometimes you're using something that someone else wrote. But we're always plugging things together. Let's say we're writing something that needs data from an API. Well, I'm not writing my own network layer or HTTP client, that's a waste of time -- someone else did that. So I'll write a class that handles using an HTTP client to pull down data from an API and do something useful with it. Cool. Now I have something that can be plugged into a larger system to do other things based on that data. Rinse, repeat until you have a program that's solving a unique problem (or solving an old problem in a new and hopefully better way). A core rule of our craft is \"don't reinvent the wheel\". If something already exists to do what you need to do, use it. If it doesn't, write it yourself. But generally speaking once you get past the educational phase and into the real world, you're solving unique problems within a certain domain -- medical billing, insurance, manufacturing, banking, flight scheduling, game development, whatever. You're not going to find ready-made solutions to everything within that domain, so you'll by designing and implementing solutions with the lower-level stuff as building blocks.",

When you build a house, you CAN go out and cut your own trees, forge your own nails, build a crane. Or you can use lumber made by someone else, maybe pay a crane operator instead. That said, you still need to figure out where to place the supports, which type of nail or screw you need and where to put them, how thick the walls need to be for insulation + electricity. The seniors are thinking about how to make sure the house is weather resistant, passes local zoning, ways to cool the house naturally without just using a ton of AC. Your job is to make something work with high fidelity, on a timeline, up to spec, and part of that is making tradeoffs in how you build it. A very big part of that in the modern world is deciding between different libraries and packages for your job. Maybe HTTP is best for your project, maybe gRPC, maybe graphql — they are all prebuilt tools but still need a ton of implementation within your projects to work and all come with pros and cons. One thing is for certain though, you can’t just tell the lumber company and the crane operator to design and build the house. The lions share of the work still needs to be done, decisions need to be made, hours have to be spent — and that’s your job.",

There is no pejorative sense here, although as a hacker I guess I may sound biased and I am biased at least in terms of being one of these and not the other. Plumbers seek to put together parts from a catalogue. Lead through the catalogue, pick the right part for the problem, buy the parts, put them together. Hackers seek to understand the problem and the machine and be able to derive a solution from the combination. No catalogues necessary. Of course, people are always a mixture of both to a greater or lesser extent. But at least in terms of hackery, programming is NOT bolting together things we already knew. It is finding new ways to say things. There always seem to be a lot more plumbers than hackers. But maybe that’s because of environment. A lot of programming is done for money and money tends to discourage hackers and push everyone to be a plumber.",

But if you have a clear goal, like mobile development, or embedded systems or web development, then I think watching crash courses that focus on that alone is a lot more beneficial if you're trying to master your field of interest. It's good to be curious, but doing 3 different crash courses on completely different things can lead to fatigue and burn out, at least that was my experience when I did that.",

In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.Step 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what \"things\" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other \"what ifs\" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).After step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of \"todo list\" of sorts for what I actually need to \"actively do\" to learn that material \"for realsies\".Step 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.Suffice it to say that \"Step 3\" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a \"library\" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).For step 3 (\"implementations\") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes \"unfinishable\" for me in practice because I tend to write \"too many\" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little \"checklist\" to keep progress:\\[ \\] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\\[ \\] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\\[ \\] (146) \\*bar\\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \\* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" as synonyms for \"(\" and \")\" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\\[5\\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \\* \\[1 + 2\\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \\* (1 + 2).\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output....In my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a \"\\*\" mark to mean \"it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise\", \\*\\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \\*\\*\\* or more to mean it is an \"advanced\" exercise.The stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.These \"checklists\" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual \"stuff\" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE).

Try reading code that makes use of the concepts to see how they are used in non-trivial programs. There are many public source codes available online. Also, playing around with the concepts and examples and making your own and modifying the exercises and observing what happens basically makes taking notes obsolete. But if you are taking a programming class and would be quizzed on the definitions or explaining the concepts, that's when taking notes makes more sense. Or more theoretical concepts that are abstract and hard to wrap your head around",

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.So, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.Similar with constructors. You can use the constructor to perform logic that **must** be done before the class gets interacted with. Go grab some service dependencies, initialize some variables, warm up the cache, whatever you need.",

You change your class to store a radius instead of a diameter.Now *everyone calling .diameter will have broken code.* This is a problem.In Java, you'd write a getDiameter() method for people to use and make your diameter a private variable. getDiameter() would just return the diameter, but then when you refactor your code to store a radius instead, you can just make getDiameter() return 2 * radius.

However, if you wanted to do something like clean the input - check bounds, convert type, etc., - or fire an event or something when the value is retrieved or written to, this is where a getter or setter is really valuable.C# does a better job of this, IMO, but getters and setters are the norm because globally accessible variables are a HUGE no-no in virtually every application.Most often setters are the complicated ones and public getters that just spit out the value of the variable are pretty common. However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. From the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier. Likewise, if for whatever reason getting that information stops working, I know exactly where to look which saves time with debugging.",

Just think of it as a method that is always called on construction. Could you create an init() function that you have to call after you create the object? Yes you could, and you often do if you want to be able to return a failure code. However when you don't need to return a failure code, it's less typing to just initialize in a constructor.One area I've found setters as being really nice is lets say you have a variable that should only be a number between 0 and 10, and you have a bug where it's being set to 100007. How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007? With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.As for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set. And see why setters are nice above.",

More on that at the end.Presumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200? Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab? These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made. Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change. For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it. To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. But when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will, their only purpose is to keep it consistent. These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A, those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming. If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer. They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same: while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) ) { display bad input message() new_value = get new input from user () }",

It doesn't do anything by itself, but you need to know what the type of a variable is so that you know what operations you can do with that variable. You can't do things directly with `int`. There's no \"thing\" to work with.

This isn't good, because this means that if you want to update the contents of one of the arrays, you will have to change multiple places in your code, where you should only need to change one place in your code for such a change.* Similarly, in `UserInterface`, you have one area that prints out a numbered list of all the actions that the user can choose from, but the logic that goes along with each of those actions is elsewhere in the file. It would be good to use a data structure such that if you needed to add an action, remove an action, or rearrange the actions, you could do so by only making one edit to the code, not multiple edits.",

It might make the code look better, something like: switch(command) { case 1 -> generateRandom(); case 2 -> generateWithLength(); case 3 -> generateWithLetter();and so on. But it is a matter of taste.You could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.It is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

No, I am not referring to updating the content of string arrays through a method.Let's look at the `dCons` field as an example:2a. You define `dCons` as an array that contains 40 elements, which is perfectly fine.2b. However, later on, when you *use* `dCons`, your code looks like this: dCons[random.nextInt(40)]Here, you have explicitly hardcoded the length of `dCons`. In the future, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will need to update *two* places in your code — 2a and 2b. That's not good, because it's important that those two places in your code stay in sync.Instead, it's better to remove the hard-coded length in 2b, and have it *read* the length, via something like `dCons[random.nextInt(dCons.length)]`. This way, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will simply need to update *one* place in your code, and everything else will automatically adjust.",

I have done that before with hard to reason about code bases with dynamic, interaction-based and hard to understand flows and it was surprisingly useful. It might make less or more sense in your case, depending on the context.Perhaps there are also static analysis tools for whatever language/application you're dealing with that can visualize modules, module members and relationships between them. I have also written custom tools for that for my code base and it was also quite useful, but it's a bit much. Besides that, I'd say perhaps don't sweat too much about it unless there's a good reason and let it come to you organically, as you work through the issues and features (hopefully, gentle at first).",

This could easily be handled by a single kernel thread when it comes to CPU load, so it makes perfect sense to create virtualized threads, which expose the same API as a kernel thread, but all run on a single kernel thread.When faced with CPU-bound work, however, user space threads are simply not that useful. No matter how you slice your algorithm, you only have a fixed number of threads capable of independent computation, so even if you run 10 thousand virtual threads per kernel thread, all of them together can execute only as much real computation (not waiting) as the kernel thread itself. Of course, since managing user space threads has some overhead, this is also a net negative in performance for CPU-bound work.Modern server applications are rarely CPU bound, though, so feel free to go as far as you want with your millions of user space threads, like Go has shown to be completely possible and manageable.",

        "body": "This is actually dependent on whether the OS scheduler can reliably have threads run on different physical cores. With some server products, it absolutely can. If your program executes on a single core, there's no benefit. Multithreading (and lightweight async execution) lets a program benefit from context switching where a blocked thread can surrender the cpu until its data arrives. The OS scheduler will do this with processes as well. As long as the thread can still do work on the cpu, there's no point in switching off. Also, do note that cpu cores are pretty good at parallelizing independent work and simulating in order execution. We've had cpus with multiple ALUs per core for example since the 90s and the hardware will dispatch parallel instructions as long as there's no dependency within the execution window. You as a programmer don't have to specifically ask for this. The same is true for things like hard disk caching.On the multiple cpu issue, it is worth testing or reading more about if you need this. There have been notorious cases like Playstation where hardware designers shipped multi-core hardware only to find that the OS hardly ever used more than one and never more than two. On the flip side, there are cases like Sql Server on Windows, where the server absolutely can scale across cores to process large volumes of data. I know that's an IO bound load, but often the whole load is aggressively cached when the request comes in so there's low latency.",

        "body": "It can be, if the executor of the user-space threads is itself multi-threaded and runs on multiple system threads.User-space threads are designed to solve a very specific issue - to reduce the time a system thread needs to wait on operations that block (think: locking a mutex, waiting for IO, waiting for timer,...). It is implemented thusly:Instead of calling blocking APIs, we call their non-blocking alternatives . The non-blocking version of the API works the same, but instead of blocking, it returns \"would block\" error.A user-space thread is a state machine. The states are the values of thread-local variables at the points where blocking operation is called. Advancing a state means executing all the code up to the operation that would block.This advancing of states is done by an executor, which runs directly on a system thread. The executor has a set of user-space threads. It advances a user-space thread up until the point it calls a \"blocking\" that would block. It then tries to find another user-space thread in the set, which no longer blocks and can be advanced. If all the user-space threads in the set are blocked, the executor (ie. the system thread its running on) blocks, until one of the user-space threads unblocks (operating-systems do have API that lets you wait on multiple blocking operations simultaneously, until one of them unblocks).As you can see from this, user-space threads are completely useless for CPU-bound tasks (ie. tasks that don't wait on blocking operations). You might as well just directly run such tasks as a sequence, because that's exactly what a user-space thread executor will end up doing (likely with some additional overhead).HOWEVER! A user-space thread executor can be parallelized using system threads. You spawn multiple system threads (as many as your computer has cores) aka. a thread pool. Each system threads runs an executor, but they all share the same set of pending tasks. Now the tasks (in our case, user-space threads) can actually truly run in parallel.That being said, user-space threads, as tasks for thread pools, is not the best abstraction for CPU-bound tasks. If you don't divide the work evenly between the user-space threads, then some of the system threads in the thread pool will be busy with big long tasks, while the rest are parked, waiting for something to do.A better abstraction are tasks that can be automatically broken down into sub-tasks that can be done in parallel. That way, the thread pool can automatically spread the load among the system threads. For example \"apply this operation to each item in a list\" can be easily split into processing sub-ranges of the list, or even individual items.This is why pure functional paradigm has gained some notable traction in the last decade. It is trivially parallelizable, because the program is ultimately a tree of function calls where branches (ie. evaluation of arguments) can be evaluated independently of one another.Imperative code, much less so, because it essentially describes a sequence of operations that are expected to be executed in order. Transforming that sequence into multiple independent parallel sequences (ie. threads) is not trivial.",

Usually one process:one app but when you can and want to utilise multiple CPU cores you need more processes. That usually gets called multi threading but that's not what your operating system, or my concurrent computing textbook calls it.In my experience outside uni, both these things tend to get called threads without much care for the very important distinctions. Like I'm seeing people talk about user vs kernel threads and it kinda sounds like when they say kernel thread they mean what I've called a process above. However windows and Linux both provide a kernel feature that matches my definition of a thread above. Not having a go at anyone we're all just using words the way we were taught to. Bottom line is though, if you're confused about what someone is saying about threads it's probably because the word means something different to them than it does to you.",

That kind of logical thinking translates really well to programming.The fact that you've already played around with TrueNAS, Linux, and Docker shows you're not starting from zero. Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.At Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.The ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove.

Don't let that scare you off though, it can absolutely still be done.One piece of advice I can give on self-teaching (from an ADHDer as well) is pick ONE language and stick with it for learning. It absolutely does not matter which one you choose as long as it isn't completely obscure, or something like COBOL. The fundamental concepts are all the same in every language.I started with Ruby, learned C# through my first job, now work in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.I'd recommend you start with JavaScript (alongside HTML and CSS) as you can use those 3 to build interactive web pages and get immediate feedback and a sense of achievement, which is big when self-teaching, especially for ADHD folk. Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. For where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",

Just stay consistent, try to do a bit each day, and review the last few things you did at the beginning of each session, as the assignments often build upon one another. Good luck, you got this!",

Typically an array or list is good for most things. When given the option, prefer nonresizable arrays to arraylists/vectors to linked lists. If your language doesn't provide options then it doesn't matter.If you are searching for things in an array, try a map or a set. If you need to add/remove things from the front, try a queue or a deque. Other datastructures have niche advantages; but you'll know when you need them. The rule of thumb I use is that if I'm reading about something and see a datastructure mentioned I check its wikipedia page; it's probably important to whatever I'm doing.For algorithms, if you need to sort or do some other common operation your programming language probably has a way to do it that's faster than anything you can write. Otherwise, just write it in a way that works, then think if there's any way to optimize it a bit if you really need performance or it's really ugly.As much as I like quicksort I don't think I've ever needed to write it myself. Even C has qsort().",

The whole idea of learning DSA is to learn how to evaluate the pros and cons of each structure or algorithm, and decide based on the individual case.However, for most real-world applications it isn't that hard. Never implement an algorithm, if some exists in the language/library/framework you are using! Don't choose a sorting algorithm, use the built-in sort, that is always the most efficient one! And for data structures, there are mostly only two choices: lists and maps. A list is an ordered list of items, where you can get, add, remove, insert any item you want. A map is a collection of items identified by a unique key-value, for instance user-objects with a userId. Every language has effective implementations of both, in Python it is list and dict, in JavaScript it is Array and Object, in Java it is ArrayList and HashMap, and so on. Most of the time one of these will do just fine!But if you want to know more, you need a course in DSA - or a good book. I really like [\"Grokking Algorithms\"](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms-second-edition) \\- it focuses much more on the understanding, than on the actual implementation or the math.",

I kept pushing and pushing. Then I left it alone until last week. That overkill, killed my buzz and pushed me away from learning for that long.. I’m not saying don’t go hard, but you have to know when to take control and have a your breaks, where you’re not focused on the task but something like a hobby. Or reading a book, nothing to do with the task at hand. Because if you take an intermission, and you keep thinking about what you can’t do to breakthrough, the break didn’t mean anything at all. Because it didn’t help you in anyway. So again, anytime you take a break, make sure you do something fun, or something relaxing / unrelated to your studies..",

So you have a 1/259,200,000 chance to experience a bit flip during this check. Now this doesn't mean the bit flip will happen at the memory location that your value is stored though. 4GB of RAM has 32,000,000,000 bits in it. So that alone means a 1/32,000,000,000 chance that the bit flip happens in the location that your data is stored.So the odds of a bit flip happening during your calculation and landing on the memory location where your data is stored is 259,200,000 x 32,000,000,000.

You'll normally never it in personal computers, because it's much more expensive; but for certain critical applications, a company or agency may decide to pay extra for it. ECC guards against memory corruption due to spontaneous magnetic flips in the physical storage medium, mostly from background radiation. This is not limited to, but includes cosmic rays, for which reason spontaneous bit flip increases with altitude and is worst in satellites (as u/MediumRay said). And of course, if a bit has spontaneously flipped, that bit could represent a variable in a comparand, or for that matter an operand.How real is this problem as opposed to merely theoretical? Well, as I said, it's not enough of a problem to be worth fixing in personal computers, but still a concrete enough problem for there to be a manufacturing sector and a market for ECC RAM. People out there are paying a lot of money for this stuff, and probably for good reason. So in certain applications, it's a possibility real enough to pay money to mitigate.I don't think choice of language should be expected to have any effect. Ultimately an opcode is an opcode. The way to fix it is to buy ECC, not to program around it.",

Needless to say programs ran strangely after that statement was executed.Don’t put harmful code in your program. The threat profile to worry about is this: some future maintainer of your program misunderstanding something and changing it to run the harmful code.As far the chance of arithmetic errors goes, if a damaged machine has those going on, it’ll crash out long before it gets to running your program.

It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.`scanf()` is not moving the cursor. The OS is. Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS). It turns out that the cursor advances all the time. Like when you type in the command to compile:```$ _$ g_$ gc_$ gcc_```After each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time). But terminals are very complex things. Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and \"sending them\" to the application.IOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes. It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc. Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: \"Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is.\" Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.It's somewhere from \"a little\" to \"way more\" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea. Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them. If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer. Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application. Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).If you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated \"APUE\".",

Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).Also in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal. This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to. A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.The terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed. But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.In modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.In a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",

The Odin Project is probably a good start though. I will however give you a great starting reference guide though - [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)This is a site that not only has documentation for just about anything you can do with HTML/CSS/Javascript(these three were as deep as we got) but also includes built in environments to start messing around and see what happens when you change different values. One thing I do recommend though - learn HTML at least reasonably well before you move onto CSS. CSS is an *amazing* tool that basically acts as templates. It makes a lot of things much easier to do but it's important to know *how* they work under the hood if you want to really get your skills up. Trust me, HTML is not hard and you can get up to speed relatively quickly. Our course was like once a week for 12 weeks and by the end we could make functional websites with decent designs.One amusing thing about HTML compared to other languages - it does not care how bad your coding is. It will try to run it anyway. You can have a garbled mess of garbage that god himself will not forgive under the hood and as long as the important parts are functional it'll still go, as opposed to other programming languages that tell you to die in a fire if you miss one bracket. Just something to keep in mind - your code may work despite being terrible(professor asked me \"what the hell is all this doing?\" one time when I had a solid 30 lines of broken code) so use some attention to detail to keep it clean.Hope that helps a bit, best wishes!",

Also, it really does come down to surfing the web, especially Github. Read the issues lists of repos you're interested in. But reproducible bugs suitable for beginners are rare in my experience.",

A boolean is the most basic example of a flag, but there are alternatives. `SDL_Init` uses a technique where each individual bit in a larger block of data is used as a flagThis lets you group a load of related flags together in a compact block of memory. In the `SDL_Init` scenario, each bit (flag) corresponds to a subsystem you want to initialize.`SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)` passes a collection of bits where everything is off (`0`) except for the one bit that corresponds to the video system, therefore signalling that is the only thing you want to initialize.The main advantage of using bit flags over booleans in scenarios like this is that it gives people using the library a very convenient way to specify a combination of flags they want to enable. You use the bitwise operator `|`. Setting two bits to \"on\" looks like this: SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO)There's a guide to bit flags and how they're used in SDL's API design here: https://www.studyplan.dev/intro-to-programming/bitwise-operators",

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:```some_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);```Now this function call only says hello.This way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.Hope this explains it. I haven't written C++ in a long while, so my syntax might be a bit off.",

An example is std which rather than being on/off sets your c++ standard to 17 or 20 or 23 or whatever else.Sometimes an integer used as multiple flags is still called a flag, though its bitwise treated as up to 64 individual boolean/bit values.So while the term OFTEN refers to single bits, it does not HAVE to, and it does not even have to refer to a 2 state toggle, but can represent the state of a multi-state (eg left/right/forward/reverse) entity. And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\\*x+2\\*y + 42\\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42. What is common to all of it is that when you hear the term 'flag' you usually should think 'optional configurable/alternative behavior'.",

As a dev I'd say about 90% of my work is researching patterns and approaches, finding the right library, figuring out the domain. LC is a great opportunity to practice that last 10% where it's just you and a code problem, not because the skill translates, but more the discipline to work through a problem, start to finish, figure out where it's weak and improve it.This doesn't mean it will make you a 10% better dev of course, you're likely already a pretty solid problemsolver, but it is not entirely worthless.",

Second, a lot of those people are successful programmers who are good at what they do, so in a sense, they're correct. You can be a good programmer and be bad at leetcode.I would say, though, that the reverse is far less likely. There are far more good programmers who are bad at leetcode than there are bad programmers who are good at leetcode. For interviewers, this is usually a good trade. Sure, the leetcode arbitrarily filters out some good talent, but it also effectively filters out bad talent. Not all, but most. A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. Programming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. But there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

All tasks can be solved through 'software' ways: You can install virtual machines on the MacBook and check how remote access works. You can set up a hypervisor on the PC, configure GPU passthrough, and run 2 virtual machines simultaneously: Windows for gaming and Linux for work tasks. I have set up remote access to my PC, there can be some obstacles. Home internet provider may use for your connection a 'gray' IP address. Also, some providers offer dynamic IPs, but this can be resolved by sending the address after startup. Additionally, the PC mainboard should support Wake on LAN.",

Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.Leadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. As for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

When I was taking my CS class it was in Python with me coming from a C++ and Java background and it's probably going to sound stupid but my biggest hang up was not having defined types. I just couldn't wrap my head around it. But to answer your question it might be a good idea to look into some basic Python stuff online or see if your local library (if you have one and have access) has a book on it. For some reason the libraries around here are seriously lacking in coding books unless you count like WordPerfect 5.1 or something.",

I personally prefer more structured languages, like C#, Java, and C++. I actually prefer C++ (I use the POCO library) overall because it lets me write the fastest code possible, and to access other C/C++ libraries directly (most of the core libraries you'll use in any backend framework are based on C++). But I learned to program long ago and I'm in the minority on that.For front-end, you are ultimately always working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are a ton of pre-processors that can compile, obfuscate, and otherwise turn code from some other source format into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For my part I just use those basics straight, usually with jQuery. But I've also used JavaScript compilers like esbuild (which I like because it's very fast).So I think it's largely a matter of taste and people tend to mostly use what they already know.I think the main constraints are (1) if you're writing server code that needs to be very fast, you either need to master something like numpy or the equivalent JavaScript libraries, or use C++ or rust. In my opinion, it's easier to use a fast language like C++ instead of trying to cleverly use numpy or other C++-based libraries to make a slow language like Python faster. And (2), because front-end code is always in JavaScript, if I'm using a scripted back-end language I'll prefer Node over Python, just to keep everything in the same language.",

If you start from python its hard to understand heap VS stack memory, memory leaks, pointers, parsing binary data into structs and other concepts. Its also the common intermediate language between many languages - many languages have integration with C, and then integration between the languages is done through C.You may not use these \"low level concepts\" most days (depending on your job), but when you will need them (optimizations, weird bugs, integration with weird external projects) you will understand them better. You will also learn to appreciate higher level languages, and understand some of the \"whys\" in their design.Then, in parallel, python is just a great scripting language for quickly getting something done, can teach you how higher level languages work, and many big projects use it.After knowing enough of those two, i would suggest trying to understand what you like and want to learn/work at, and either pick another language popular in that domain or stick with C/Python.",

If you're processing less than 100,000 records I'd classify this adventure as \"premature optimization.\"> Would this even be the best way to implement what i want?It depends. Does this describe you?- You're willing to invest time and effort into mucking with low-level details of binary file handling- You don't need a working program quickly- You want to learn about handling large binary files- You're willing to write a lot of low-level unit tests of data handling- You're willing to accept some risk of data corruption bugs in production that you don't find in testing- You understand that adding more fields to your data, or the ability to look up fields based on something other than timestamp, is going to be a complicated extra feature- You're willing to accept the possibility of some subtle failure modes (e.g. it can be very tricky to write correct code in terms of atomicity and consistency)> if I want to remove parts and move everything back to \"fill in\" the space, it could lead to having to move very large amounts of dataThis is called \"garbage collection\" and yep, it's a big design problem that pops up in lots of different applications. You don't define \"very large\" but I would suggest planning for your garbage collection to take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.One option is to add a \"This record has been deleted\" flag to each record, then you can \"fast-delete\" by rewriting the byte that contains the flag (without moving anything else). Then you could have a slow, infrequent garbage collection function that compacts everything.If you want to avoid downtime, you should think about (slowly) writing the compacted data into new files in a separate thread while using the old file to answer queries. Then you have some logic that quickly swaps to using the new file.Of course the easiest thing to do is just show the user a warning if, say, >20% of records are garbage. Then it's up to the user to follow the procedure in the manual for running the garbage collection at a convenient time.I should also ask: Do you know if (a) your deletion pattern is \"random\" / arbitrary, or (b) you always delete records in the order they were created? If (b) you can simply delete each file as its records pass the \"too old\" threshold. (The \"delete\" terminology usually implies (a), for situation (b) a clearer term would be \"log rotation\".)",

From the little brochure web site for an electrician to, I dunno, TurboTax and other vast and complex stuff.Some of it is desktop software. Autocad, for example, is a really big and elaborate piece of desktop software constructed over many years by many master, journeyman, and apprentice tradespeople. We call them lead, senior, and junior developers. Some of it is mobile software. The reddit mobile app is an example.We have \"boot camps\" to help people get started. https://freecodecamp.org/ is a good self-paced boot camp. There are many others.The boys at Harvard offer their CS50 (computer science 50) class online for free, and you'll get a lot of really useful theory there. But keep in mind they are computer scientists. Think \"professors of mechanical engineering\". And most of us programmers use that theory to make useful stuff rather than to solve programming puzzles.There's a related trade called IT (information technology). This one involves setting up and maintaining computers and networks and servers and all that stuff. It's not quite the same as programming, but just as helpful to end-users. If you have electrician chops, this could be a straightforward transition for you, because good wiring correctly installed is a critical success factor. It's possible you could do this under the IBEW umbrella (I think, I don't know from union stuff). Welcome to our trade. Like anything, you gotta practice. I hope to see something you made one day.",

One other thing to note is that Programming can be very different to what some people think working on computers is. If you prefer a more hands on role like installing and maintaining systems or servers you might consider looking at the CompTIA or CCNA route. CompTIA A+, Net+ and Sec+ are industry standard certs that can progress you from basic IT Support to full network admin. CCNA is Cisco’s pathway for working with their systems. If you prefer the physical side and setting up servers or devices those might offer a better match with coding.Edit: I was able to use CS50x to get advanced entry into 2nd year of college(skip 1st year). I did the 2 year higher cert in 1 year which then got me into Uni in 2nd year. No time lost even though I had to go a bit longer around it.",

Meaning: you should be good enough to handle 80% of development on either frontend or backend.So if you think you got enough information on Springboot to do 80% of the development on a Springboot app, learn some JavaScript.And to clarify that \"80% of a Springboot app\": handle network requests, CRUD operations, unit testing (enough to read the unit tests for another class, and copy how it's handling testing for your class), and enough OOP / MVC best practices to avoid making a complete mess (which honestly isn't too much, but hard for me to describe atm).",

The language used for the coding aspect depends on the school (mine chose Python), but they do not teach much either, only the basics really. This is very evident now that we are starting our NEAs, because almost everyone in my class is panicking.I do the bulk of my learning independently because of this, so I can confidently say that if you put your mind to it, you will be able to learn any language you want, or do any personal project you want. Everything is well documented with a virtually infinite amount of resources. I recommend W3schools for an introduction to any of the well known languages, and CS50x for a general introduction to computer science. They also have offshoots like CS50p specifically for Python.Good luck with your studies! :)",

The fact that you're self-aware about your code quality actually shows you're learning, which is good.The React Router/Remix situation you mentioned? Don't stress too much about keeping up with every framework change. Focus on understanding the fundamentals really well.At Metana, we see a lot of bootcamp grads who started exactly where you are. The ones who succeed aren't necessarily the ones with perfect code, they're the ones who can learn fast and solve problems.You're probably more ready than you think. Start applying to junior roles while continuing to build projects. The worst they can say is no, and you'll learn what gaps you still need to fill.Good luck :)",

Knowing that the project was going to be the basis of several upcoming projects, we created a generic and working \"starter kit\" based on the original project that had heavy AWS integration (it was 2019) and some ML stuff sprinkled in.I had been working mostly frontend until then, but found myself on this internal project. My job was to put together the backend of the core starter kit or \"platform\" as we called it. The frontend was also a generic frontend that could be branded and modify very easily, and my backend needed to work no matter what the client's ask was.Eventually this became a much bigger deal with dozens of people on the broader project once the platform started selling. Back then though, it was a great time to learn how backend works in the real world without being tied to a client.",

        "body": "You don’t need a degree as the other commenter mentioned. The job market is fucked for people who have degrees too.Here’s what you need to do: 1.) Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. You should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. You will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. 5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. 6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.Bonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.First dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp. Paid $11,000 annually. I did it for a year, leveraged the experience on my resume and landed a $70k gig as a junior developer 8 months later.Edit: I don’t have a degree in CS. But I do have a bachelors in psychology. Which may or may not have helped my chances.",

If you want to do websites, and webapps, and APIs, use JS/TS and Go. If you want to build performant, cross platform applications, especially in the corporate world, C# is great (especially compared to Java, IMO).But at the end of the day, they're all general purpose languages, they all do \"mostly the same things\", and there's TONS of overlap.For example, I'm a TS/Go developer. But I play around with AI and local LLMs all the time. I write Python, I run Python, it hasn't been a problem for me - even though I've never formally learned Python. However, if I wanted to train AI, perhaps I'd need to learn Python more deeply.I've also developed C# applications, although I mostly try to avoid OOP/MVC. I like that Microsoft is responsible for both C# and TS, they play nice together, and they share a lot of features.",

There's a short period of time where you can get hired to do Y without previous experience in Y. After that, they're only going to hire people who already know Y. Further, it's easier for you to get X jobs than Y jobs, because you already know X well.You also can pivot to Y and choose wrong. I had one job where everyone was excited to be learning Angular 1.0.Outside of big tech, where you need to be able to solve leetcode hards, they tend to hire based on N years of experience in X language.

AWS, iPhone, Facebook, YouTube among others were all launched in that time period. There was massive growth every year as more people got cell phones, wanted apps and social networking and companies moved compute to the cloud. Fast forward to 2025, everyone who wants a mobile app has one, everyone who wants on the cloud is already there. What’s the iPhone moment now? LLMs? One of the reasons they are being pushed so much is that this is probably the only hypergrowth market around right now. While there will always be a need for engineers unless there is a heretofore unknown radical increase in demand, one that AI/offshoring can’t meet, the past 20 years of growth are gone. It’s a mature industry now.",

That was equivalent to all of Europes working games sector numbers at the time. 1-2% were hired on graduation. I would suggest that what we see now is bad but it’s more in line with historical trends than what we remember from 5-6 years ago. It is probably still not as bad as it was around 2001 where there was practically nothing to apply for let alone competition.

As your manager or mentor, I would want to work with you on that preoccupation because it can be career-limiting. Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.Having said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. I would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)Send your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.Try not to assume the worst in people. You created something so good that an upper level manager thought it was good enough to scale to other departments. The higher up managers are, the less they know about what is happening on the ground, so don’t take it personally.",

Trump is the one who passed the bill to make that all happen.Now onto the BBB, the long and short of it is, it's likely going to tank the value of the dollar. Increased government spending (practically across the board), less taxes, more borrowing.I genuinely say this as a die-hard fiscal conservative: This is ***not*** about Trump. This is ***not*** about party politics. This is about the value of the dollar, and how it plays a key role in global international politics.The USA is going to have a Brexit-level fall off.

I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. I don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane. These kids who only graduated like 3-4 years after me are such sweats, they can solve these leetcode hards like it’s nothing.

I dropped out of med school to get into tech and there were definitely moments where I questioned if I made the right call, especially during those brutal rejection cycles.The market right now is absolutely insanee. Even people with solid backgrounds like yours are getting ghosted left and right. It's not a reflection of your worth or abilities, the hiring process is just broken in a lot of ways.Something I've noticed works better than the traditional apply and pray approach is that you need stuff people can actually see and touch. Your GPA and internships are great but recruiters want to see what you can build. Even small projects on GitHub that solve real problems can make a huge difference.Also, have you considered bootcamps? I know it might seem like a step backward given your background, but sometimes the structured approach and job placement support is what breaks through. At Metana we've had people with CS degrees who just couldn't crack the interview process, and the hands-on training plus career support made all the difference.The other thing is, what specific roles are you targeting? Sometimes pivoting within tech (like from pure SWE to product management, technical sales, or developer relations) can open doors that weren't there before.Your education definitely wasn't wasted even if it feels that way right now. Those problem solving skills transfer to pretty much anything. But I get the frustration, job hunting is soul crushing.Take a breather if you need to, but don't give up just yet :) The market will turn around.",

I decided to branch out and got into FAANG. I specifically went to this one because it was known as the palce that you could have work-life balance and I Was going to make 120k with 45k in stock a year. But I didnt realize I was going into cloud and cloud is the death of work life balance in FAANG. I learned the hardway and spent 3 stressful years playing their game. I didnt leave because by the time I saw how bad it was, the market was going down and I didnt want to spend a year or two unemployed. I got fired after 3 years due to low perforamance but I was working 10x more than my first job. Thankfully I bounced back in 3 months, got a job in big tech that paid more and has been more chill.",

As you can imagine this was a vicious cycle that never really got any better until I left.Fortunately the beauty of remote work is that you can generally find a workplace that will accommodate you, especially if you don't live on the west coast and can take advantage of the time zone difference.edit: It's unfortunately very normal for some workplaces to be like that. My experiences with early morning people in management positions is that they tend to be pretty unreasonable and may go out of their way to sabotage you if you don't want to work on their schedule.",

Generally speaking, if you are just building user-facing features, Android has a lower ceiling as most of the hard problems should be taken care of by the backend. You aren't going to build something out of a system design interview in your day to day.But here are some examples where you CAN differentiate yourself:1) Building frameworks / features in a way that's easy to iterate on. What if your app wants to show every new UI screen with a certain template that serves a nice entrance and exit animation? Okay, now you have to build that animation out. But it would be inefficient for every engineer who wants to add a new screen to deal with that themselves, so you build it in a way with enough abstractions / modularity that it's easy to use for other use cases.2) Finding and solving problems that nobody knows exist, because they're not directly attributable to the product. Maybe your app startup time is too long, or you lose a lot of users while a certain page loads. You have the ability to improve this stuff and see incremental but significant gains in engagement.3) Influencing the backend / APIs - the backend doesn't always know exactly what's needed and what's possible from a mobile perspective, or edge cases that might arise. Being good at your job means you participate in these discussions, not just showing up to plug in their fully baked implementation to the mobile appI'd also add this: judging the value of an engineer solely in the context of \"What technically difficult problems can they build\" as if you need to be building something worthy of a case study in an algorithms textbook is a very junior way of thinking.",

Especially in the tech world, it's not unheard of for one C-Suite to reach out to another to \"warn\" them about a problem candidate. A close friend of mine was let go after her first 2 weeks at a new company after the CEO of the company we both worked at got wind that she was trash-talking her experience on Facebook. He reached out to another exec at her new company, pointed out her posts, and said it would be risky to keep her on. Another is that some companies love to sue. This is especially true when people sign a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement. If a former employee starts talking shit and the company catches wind, you could lose out on your severance, they could come after you in court, or just make you suffer through a legal fight you likely can't afford. As much as I would love to expose the garbage companies I've worked for, it's not without it's risks and frankly, many folks aren't in a position to defend themselves.",

This was masked by the 2012->2022 software boom driven mostly by VC money that finally died down.To some extent mobile development (Android/iOS) created some demand, but you need a bit higher skill to get into that even as entry level and that market is also massively slowing down lately.",

I had a year of savings in my emergency fund. Unemployment is difficult to get, doesn’t last long, and peanuts in my state compared to other states so it wouldn’t have really been much help to me.2. PIP terms were a month-long effort with goals that were realistically scoped larger than a month and also depended on the rest of the team for success. Resignation was an immediate two-week notice period but I was given the time to brush up my resume, prepare for interviews, etc. Not having to work my ass off for an extra paycheck to have two weeks of uninterrupted job search time was worth it to me.

A layoff for a company that staid in business, means that somebody didn't consider you part of the group that was worth hanging on to, while a resignation is still your own choice, and that perceived negative judgment never comes.I don't know this part for sure, but I believe there may be some kinds of background checks, like for those entrusted to very high-security operations, which asks explicitly whether you left voluntarily or involuntarily, and (again just spitballing) but I expect the check may not pass if the story doesn't match up with investigation, or if there are too many involuntary departures over a certain amount of time.",

I stood out.It may require being patient and persistent, but local roles felt so much better in terms of getting interviews. There just aren't as many to go around, which is stressful.

The options and network were so much better than shotgunning my resume across the country.Maybe my advice is hit up some meetups, find the really local job boards, startup incubator spaces, etc, and try to meet people in person wherever possible. Lean into the benefits of being in a city not flooded by big tech layoffs. If you make a good enough impression you can get your foot in the door before the company even posts the job.

Ask clarifying questions, write out functional requirements, non-functional requirements, define core entities, define the api, do a high level design that satisfies the functional requirements via the api (like actually check them off like a todo list), then deep dive to cover your non functional requirements (check them off). That should take most of your time, might have a few questions from your interviewer boom you’re done.",

Even then, this was more than enough to land an interview (not sure what the market climate is now for new grads, but back in 2021 this was doable) If you’re struggling to get offers, couple of questions I have for you: 1. Are you getting past the resume screening at least? Are you getting recruiter phone calls and moving to the technical interviews? 2. Are you open to interviewing outside of Vancouver, maybe even in the US? 3. Curious how you’re fitting all of that experience on a resume. Related to question 1, but maybe get your resume reviewed by your university or someone?",

Your alternative is to be a unemployed person seeking an entry position which typically does target students but instead targets people looking for their first jump after 2-3 years experience. You'll be part of the unlucky cohort of people competing for junior positions with no experience. There's a reason people go back to school. Mostly to pivot and be eligible for new grad/student recruiting pipelines again. Your best bet is to continue doing internships and get a return offer. They are unfortunately the only pipeline to get into most reputable companies.If you hit the button you'll likely find yourself back in school doing a masters in a few months.",

The good news is that your background is genuinely impressive and you're not starting from zero like most new grads.Stop delaying graduation - you're essentially in limbo right now and employers can sense that uncertainty. Graduate in August and commit fully to the job search, but expand your geographic scope beyond Vancouver. Toronto, the US, or even remote opportunities could open doors that Vancouver simply can't right now. The trades and military options aren't bad backup plans, but don't abandon tech when you're this close to breaking through. Get your resume professionally reviewed, practice your interview skills extensively, and consider contract or startup roles that might be more willing to take a chance on someone with your background.I'm on the team that made [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and I've seen how much difference it makes when people can practice handling tough interview questions and get real-time feedback on their responses - it might help you convert those eventual interviews into offers.",

I think your questioning isnt only about software engineering itself. It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.As humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**Oh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?Answer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. So now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?But I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.In any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect. And if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.If its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you. Sooner or later, you will be gifted with new likes and will feel complete once again.",

Lots of solid devs are struggling to land something.For JavaScript full-stack, Id say React, Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL combo is still the most in demand combo. Its not the shiniest anymore but companies actually use it in production. Next.js is also huge right now if you wanna go that route.The thing is, at this point its less about picking the \"perfect\" stack and more about getting really good at one thing. Companies would rather hire someone who's solid at React than someone who kinda knows React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.We see this at Metana all the time. Students who try to learn everything end up not being great at anything. The ones who pick a stack and build 2 to 3 real projects with it are the ones getting hired.Build stuff that actually does something useful. Not another todo app lol. Maybe a small SaaS tool or something that solves a problem you actually have.",

For now, it's probably best to address your immediate needs, and you don't have to do it alone. Pass your resume along to your friends, search for employment services like temp agencies near you, and try to talk with career centees and career fairs to make sure you don't miss out on chances to get critical feedback on your resume. See if you can hone one resume to show technical employers, and another one to use for part-time work. Beyond that, i can't provide too much advice and you've probably heard a lot of it before. Get something, anything, under your feet to keep you going, and the rest falls into place with time and persistence. It does get better.",

In fact, you can do very well in your career by setting them up to take credit for things.I had a prior C level boss who I like a lot and he mentored me extensively (still friends). It was a very regular occurrence me briefing/explaining technical subjects and accomplishments and hearing him regurgitate them later as if he was the expert.Actually, my favourite on this front was being involved in filming a tv show and coming with a bunch of 3D scanning equipment and VR headset. Spending hours scanning a house and then explaining it to the presenter and then they filmed it like they’d known it for years.It’s slightly different, obviously but don’t let it get you down.",

I decided to go back to my old temp agency for the same very low-paying apartment groundskeeper/porter work I've done at one point when I took a short break from college, so I don't stay unemployed and without any stable source of income for too long. I'll do this for the time being until I can land a much better-paying job that's at least IT-related or adjacent.At this point, it's just outright borderline impossible to even get your foot in the tech work field door right now because there's just no way to get the necessary experience without time-traveling back to the past when entry-level jobs still existed or without compromising a lot of money(certain certifications, unpaid personal projects, volunteer, etc.). It's also gotten rather tiresome for me to see quite a lot of out-of-touch folks in so many CS subreddits making the boomer assumptions that all of the latest CS grads who are unemployed are just too unqualified and incompetent for any job in tech and that they supposedly didn't try to get internships during college. They conveniently ignore that even CS internships have gotten a lot more incredibly competitive, selective, and oversaturated now than ever because they're aren't negatively affected by today's poor job market, especially in tech.On the bright side with my temp agency work, despite not paying a liveable enough salary, at least the job itself was pretty laid-back in my experience when I briefly did it during my short time off from college before graduating.Sorry for this TL;DR-length comment. I needed to vent, so I got this off my chest.",

Every college we recruited at had a quota, and that quoata was based on not only the qualifty of candidates, but also *retention* of that candidate. Lots of SWE's don't realize it.... but we're looking into you ***years later*** to get our own stats. If every student we hire from X University leaves after 1 year, we're gonna stop hiring from that University.",

I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job What follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. My advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. And give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself. My wife described it like buying a house, you get really attached to an idea of a place where you start imagining yourself only to be out bid. But only one has to work out. Sorry if that was super long. I hope your job hunt goes well.",

That time I’m there was very little emotion. The next team I worked on, I spent 6 years going from a mid-level to and lead. Over 4 years I got to build out an awesome team. Not just developers, but a few BAs, a PM, and a QA team. This was for two huge projects. Nothing makes people close like time in the trenches. We all became great friends. After the second project launched, I needed a change of scenery and a great remote opportunity opened up that would allow me to move home. Resigning from that team was the hardest decision I ever made. Some of those developers couldn’t hardly write OOP code when they started with me and by the time I left, we were a well oiled machine. Not a day goes buy 2 years later that I don’t think about them.The last two years I had the chance to build a software dev practice from near scratch. It has been a great experience, and some of the folks I’m really going to miss when I leave in about two weeks. This time I knew it was the right decision to leave (bad culture fit, lost a big contract for reasons the dev team had no control over, inconsistent / lack of full time adjacent support, and never ending dangling of carrots that always vanished when they were to materialize). Am I going to miss my team? For sure. Some have become friends like my last team. But the reality is that for them to grow as well, I need to move on. They rely way too much on me and I failed to get them to fly on their own because of pressure from the top to deliver now now now. My new role is a director of software engineering, so it’s going to be a new experience for me… but I will always appreciate the folks I work with daily. I don’t think leaving good people is ever easy. It’s great when you can challenge each other just the right way, attack problems with some out of the box solutions, and just being nerds together in general. At the end of the day though, you have to worry about your and your career progression. You don’t want to be the guy/gal that sits for 10 years on a project and never gets to grow or even totally stagnates. It’s human to care, but at the same time be happy for what you all accomplished together and leave on a high note.",

From what you shared, you're already doing a lot right ...real experience, personal projects, leading initiatives at work. That's actual substance. Big tech doesn't only hire from Ivy League ... they hire people who can solve problems and build things. You just need to showcase it properly and target companies that don't filter purely on pedigree. Experience and interview prep do matter. But so does clarity about what you actually want. Do you want to go deep into systems? Build user-facing products? Work on small teams or at scale?Pigment self discovery helped me figure out what kind of engineering I'm wired for when I was stuck between chasing prestige versus finding purpose. It's not about \"what's next\" generically, but what growth path actually fits you. You're just at the point where the next move is less about proving you're smart and more about figuring out where that fits. Keep building, but don't forget to think about what kind of engineer you're trying to become.",

A lot of successful engineers don't start at FAANG, and plenty of people who do start there end up leaving for smaller companies anyway.You're in a pretty solid position. Full stack experience at a small company where you're leading features? That's valuable real-world experience that beats a lot of what new grads get at big companies where they might spend 6 months just learning internal tools.For getting into big tech eventually, it really does come down to two main things: 1) having solid fundamentals, and 2) being able to communicate your experience well in interviews. Your portfolio projects + the feature leadership experience you mentioned gives you good stories to tell.Don't bother with a masters unless you want to go into research or very specialized areas. The time you'd spend in school could be better used gaining more experience and prepping for interviews.Practical next steps: Start doing leetcode regularly (like 15-30 min daily), practice explaining your projects clearly, and start applying to mid-size companies as stepping stones. Companies like Shopify, Slack, Stripe etc often have good engineering cultures and pay well but aren't as competitive as the absolute top tier.For the behavioral side of interviews - this is where a lot of engineers struggle. You need to get good at telling stories about your work using frameworks like STAR. That's actually why I built Score My Interview, because so many talented engineers miss out on opportunities just because they can't evaluate and communicate their impact clearly.The comparison thing is tough but remember - social media shows highlight reels, not reality.

The old guys I know in this business, do not give a shit were you used to work. They barely care where they worked. And no one outside this business cares who you work for. Now, how do you advance your career. Try to stick it out for two years in your job (but it's okay to bail if a better opportunity comes along...becoming the CTO of your buddy's start up is not a better opportunity), then move on to the job, work another couple of years, three if you like it. Then move on. Every time you change jobs, you will get more money. More importantly, you will increase your breadth of experience. You'll be exposed to more approaches to development. Which will make you better able to advocate for one approach over another. It will also help you understand what really matters vs. what's just noise.Eventually, you'll want to start increasing your time in jobs just to show you're not a job hopper. However, you wil reach a point where it really doesn't matter. My default advice is keep your linkedIn profile up to date, turn on the quiet open to work flag, and respond to every recruiter that isn't a clear scam, even if it's to say, \"thanks, but this isn't the right opportunity for me\". My average is about three years.You do this for a while, and big tech companies will start to notice you. They may not be FAANG, but the pay is good.The most important thing to remember is that your career is a business. The companies you work for will let you go the minute you stop making financial sense. You're allowed to make the same decision about your employer.",

The thing is, there's no one \"right\" path and those social media posts are just highlight reels.And The masters thing? Honestly depends on what you want. If you're eyeing specific roles that require it, sure. But experience and strong interviewing skills usually trumps another degree.On the comparison side, remember that for every person posting about their Meta offer, there are thousands of successful devs who took different paths. The goal isn't to be the loudest person on social media, it's to build something meaningful.You're already ahead of most people just by being self aware about where you want to go.

Post uni if you aren’t given a golden ticket from graduating (Ivy+, FAANG internships, etc.) you’ll actually have to prove yourself. This means working in jobs where you have impact and actually do stuff. While it will probably be harder than resting and vesting, it will push you to have the work ethic required to be truly successful in this field. FAANG folks get paid a lot more, but aren’t really noticeably smarter from what I’ve seen. Plus after spending 3 years supporting the migration of a survey modal at big tech you might realize you weren’t really doing as much as you would have expected. Clout only gets you so far (and to be honest it does get you pretty far) but at a certain point people are going to ask what you actually do, and those who were in the trenches at their small shitty company are going to have a lot more to say than the person on the platform team with 3 PMs and a different director every month.",

It’s 1 PM, and then 3 developers who pick up random tickets ranging from devops, database querying, and then typical frontend and backend work. I have been working here for 3 months as a developer but came in with 0 experience and an unrelated degree. For the first month they did an extensive onboarding which involved teaching me as much about Java, Spring, Typescript, and React as they could. They also had me develop my own application from scratch to get me familiar with their process and tools. After that I was treated like any other developer on the team and given tickets. It’s a small team and everyone on it really loves their work so it’s very fast paced and I get to make meaningful contributions all the time which is great. I am a junior and have a ton to learn but with it being a small but stable team I am able to work on a lot of real work with real contributions which is nice, I am never sitting there trying to find something to do and was given really good training which I think is rare.",

Having regular production incidents implies you have a fragile product. That's a problem. It's not sustainable.That's one of the main things I focus on during the reverse-interview process. I really dig deep into on call rotations, how frequent calls are, when the last incident was, what the response was during that last incident, etc.Unless I'm unemployed and desperate, I will not join a company that says they get after hours calls more than a few times ***a year***. Let alone per week. The type of company you join is very much in your control.There is a bit of a differentiation between after-hours calls and business-hours calls though. During business hours there's all sorts of support issues to work through, but I'd never really describe them as all hands on deck critical production incidents. Either way, during business hours I'm OK with incidents. That's stuff I work through as a normal part of my job. It's the after hours prod fires that I'm not OK with.Here's my anecdotes for after-hours on call incidents:Company 1: I was called once in my 3.5 years here. The team as a whole was called a couple times I think. There weren't any during business-hours support fires either.Company 2: Across 5 years, there was a single after-hours prod fire I had to deal with. There were some small fires during business hours, but nothing major. Even if we didn't get them fixed during business hours, we'd just wait until the next day to fix it, so it was a very casual business as usual.Company 3: Across 2.5 years, 0 after hours calls. This company was a bit of a shit show, so they had a lot of small fires during business hours, but again nothing was ever serious enough that it couldn't wait until tomorrow morning. We were not working after 5pm.Company 4: Only been here a year, but so far 0 after hours calls.",

I have a couple friends struggling to find jobs, but they all became programmers after a career of passion or major of passion. All the folks who majored in CS because they wanted to make games or loved coding are fine. Some had to make career pivots (leaving games industry mostly cause that market is toxic as hell). The major is no longer the automagical 6 figure pumping major it was 10 years ago, but those who love the craft are finding jobs. Being on forums or discords about coding, going to hackathons, etc. I also should note I think this is a bad thing and always has been. Teams that require you to be really into it are usually toxic workaholics and creat a poor environment for long term retention.

        "body": "I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. I dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. But sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds \"since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class\" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've. But if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it. Some higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. I learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. I think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say \"I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.\"",

The fact that it was a \"stupid\" mistake doesn't reflect poorly on you at all, especially since you weren't the one who introduced it. What matters is that you identified a critical performance bottleneck, diagnosed the root cause of database deadlocks, and implemented a solution that increased concurrent request capacity by 50x. That's the kind of impact that makes interviewers sit up and take notice.The startup context actually works in your favor here because it shows you can thrive in environments where you have to wear multiple hats and solve complex problems with limited resources. Frame it as a story about your problem-solving process - how you noticed the performance issues, investigated the database connection patterns, identified the deadlock scenario, and engineered a fix that dramatically improved system scalability. Interviewers love hearing about real-world debugging skills and measurable improvements to system performance. I'm on the team that built [ interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and this is exactly the type of technical story that tends to trip people up when they're trying to present it effectively, so having a tool to help you practice articulating the impact and technical details can make all the difference in landing the role.",

At the time the max db connections was about 10 which to many of us didnt make sense because the design was meant to be more than 500. Through various debugging and unit testing skills I discovered that there was a potential deadlock that went unnoticed. I presented my findings to the team and after resolving the issue we starting seeing the max db connections go up to 500 as expected\".Maybe tie in the business impact of it too. Like it saved the company millions of dollars in troubleshooting or some BS.I dont see how this story makes you look bad. You didnt make the error, you found it and fixed it. Honestly, debugging skills is something that many companies value. Because many of these codebases are complicated especially in databases. If you can find a difficult bug in a large and bad quality codebase, you can defientely do it in a large, better code quality one. I would leave it and use it as an example. I get it probably didnt take too long but it's more about the business impact than the amount of codeor time spent.",

If your users use your service on weekends that means you will work weekends when things go wrong. The problem is the frequency in which those incidents are occurring.I'm also in banking and we avoid your issues by :1. Doing a lot of testing - development is 4 weeks behind prod.2. Have a fallback for when prod breaks - We have a \"disaster recovery\" environment that is 1 version behind and tier 1 support can activate it at the push of a button. \\#2 turns nearly any emergency into a non-emergency, the worst that will happen is a 10 minute call with support. The problem is that your team isn't putting in the necessary work to ensure that emergencies don't happen and there are no mitigation strategies for when they inevitably do occur.Your team has a lot of bad practices/habits and unless your team is willing to recognize the problem, it's only going to get worse.

Depression would be a therapy thing, I imagine that it's linked to your health too. I'd be pretty sad too if I had to live with chronic pain. Don't worry about your girlfriend, if she's good for you she won't leave you because you lost your job.. but the caveat is that she might have a chat with you or *consider* leaving you because you're not willing to fix your situation. No woman in the world wants to play mother to their boyfriend (unless they're abused or manipulative). Either way, you're smart and driven enough to work in this industry I'm sure that wouldn't be the reason a good girl would leave you. But your depression and anxiety? it might contribute, not specifically because you have depression or anxiety, but because of what depression and anxiety can do to you and those around you. So you need to really lock in and get those things sorted. How? idk, therapy? but ask someone more qualified than me (probably a therapist lol).

They'd verbally tell you you're underperforming, and they'd work with you to improve your performance.The PIP is a last resort. It's not something managers give people right away at the first sign of poor performance. It's something managers give people they already plan to fire. It's a paper trail. That's the sole purpose of a PIP, to serve as a legal paper trail of poor performance so you can't claim the company wrongfully terminated you.You should absolutely start applying to other companies.One aside though... it sounds like you're blaming all of this on the fact that you're quiet, don't chit-chat, do your work, and leave. Are you sure that's the cause? I'm quiet, I don't chit-chat, I do my work, and I leave, but I've never had issues like this. I've had bad managers before, but it doesn't have anything to do with my introvertedness. Just ask yourself that question. If there was a deeper reason behind this PIP, figuring that out would benefit your career. Ignoring it, blaming your quietness, and carrying whatever trait got you fired with you the rest of your life will make your career very painful.",

I had around 5 serious interviews and ended up with two offers, the one I accepted i just started this week. It’s going to vary wildly and i consider myself pretty fortunate that this position was posted at the right time and the tech stack was right up my alley and fairly niche. I also studied like crazy for each interview and prepped according to reviews posted on Glassdoor. In my hunt, i found a lot of jobs that were hiring where one could “get by” while still applying. Think local/state government contracts as well as contracting for companies. Pay was fine, benefits sucked, but those seemed easiest to get. So the answer is, it depends. Not counting the BS applications i sent out after accepting this offer to keep unemployment, i was at 35 total. This position was the 11th i applied for.",

Culture, food, easy travel (Schiphol LMAO) and so on are good things.

If you have kids going to college, it's phenomenally expensive. Medical care too. Funny or strange taxes. And so on. The USA gives you more options and has much simpler bureaucracy than most of Europe. If you're young and restless as we say it's not a bad idea to work here for a few years. But long term today is not as clear to consider the USA is better even at more pay. Depending on what you want of course.I'm retiring in France in 3 years. Not French, and hopefully B2 French by then. I have often regretted not staying in Europe but back then options weren't as plentiful as here. Still aren't. Bottom line.

They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.And a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.My main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.As for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.Compute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in. That's your COL increase.",

Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. If you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. So, my advice:- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews - Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA - Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away - Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k In general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. Edit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards.",

Health insurance is complicated and can be expensive to use, but my employer pays all of my premiums so it doesn't cost anything unless I go to the doctor. The biggest downside is probably the instability—over half of my division has been laid off in the last two years with the last round about a month ago. I'm making really good money (~$300k), but long term planning is hard because I could get let go any time and I doubt I could find a comparable job soon, if at all.

It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. I feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. I do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next. Good luck OP and let me know if you have any questions. I was a team lead/engineering manager for several years at big banks, with 30 total YOE.",

You can start by asking them where the holdups are and see what they say/ take it from there.

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.When an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.At least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.Doing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

You should select a problem that matches the role you want.3. It frames how you see *your* role in the problem. Do you come in with a negative framing and throw everyone else under the bus?

I'd choose Squarepoint. WLB is the #1 priority in my career. 15 vs 25 vacation days is *significant.* No amount of TC, outside of \"fuck you money\", would ever make me give up 10 vacation days.>5 days in office vs 4Same here.... this by itself makes the decision a no-brainer for me. Way back in 2016 when I got my first hybrid job I made a promise to myself I'd never work at a 100% onsite company again. Amazon would be breaking that promise. Whereas I could deal with 4 days in-office.Amazon also doesn't have a great reputation for WLB those things aside. That would also give me serious pause.But all those are things important to *me*. They might not matter at all to you, maybe you want to pursue TC, it sounds like Amazon might be offering more money. What's the yearly bonus like?

From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to \"just get it\" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.That said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.For me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.From there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the \"we've got it all\" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.Another thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is \"fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y\", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say \"oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR\" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.On a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things.

Pretty much every first time intern will experience the imposter syndrome. The company knows you’re still a student. The company knows that the point of an internship is to learn. You are not dumb, my friend.My advice is to find a colleague, maybe someone in your team or someone who’s working on something you’re curious about/interested in, and schedule a 30 minute meeting with them. Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly. Congratulations, you just got yourself a mentor.The mentor will look out for you. They’ll give you some guidance and hopefully show you the ropes. They can help you parse the code base. And if they don’t have an exact answer, chances are they know someone who does. They’ll help facilitate those other connections. See, something you learn is that people love flattery. And there’s nothing more flattering than a young person latching on to you and seeking you out because you gave them clarity. That’s the power of networking.Best of luck out there. Deep breaths. You got this!",

You're describing a completely normal junior developer experience. The fact that you're getting no negative feedback and they're cool with you taking extra time? That means you're actually doing fine. Companies don't keep people around for a year if they're truly not cutting it. But I get it, you want to level up and feel more confident.We see this pattern all the time at Metana with developers who feel stuck. The breakthrough usually comes when they start building real projects and connecting with other devs who share similar struggles and wins.Your current role is actually perfect for learning fundamentals properly. Enterprise environments teach you things bootcamps and tutorials never do, like working with legacy code, understanding business constraints, collaborating with teams.One year in is still super early. Give yourself some credit and keep pushing forward. The fact that you're self-aware enough to ask this question tells me you're gonna be just fine.You got this man, just gotta be patient with the process :)",

There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.That being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years. 1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of \"work life balance\", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. \"A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes\". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable. If this shit was easy, literally everyone and there mom would do it. There is a reason it demands a premium in pay. I believe in you, you can do this, its gunna take some work, but you have an opportunity here to build a career that people would kill for. Make the most of it!",

It’s really hard to explain and so basically I remove everything from over 5 years ago.But over qualification usually isn’t a thing and most places will interview you for sure if your resume is good. So I would say your problem might not be over qualification but maybe not having a clear objective in your resume. That’s mostly likely since you haven’t been in IC roles for a while, startups usually need more builders and workers than leadership since the founding team are the leaders already, they need grunt workStartups are in a funny place where they look for people that are founders but also founders have high flight risk so it’s a high risk environment overall from both sides.",

Key example being my distributed systems class. I work in distributed systems, and have never used a bloom filter. I've talked about gossip protocol at work a single time. The mass majority of what I learned in that class was completely useless, even though it was the most pertinent class to my specific field.The better approach is to learn as needed for a specific task, and use degrees/ certificates as signals to employers to get better jobs. Using a degree/ certificate in X primarily to *learn* will lead to a lot of wasted time learning things that you will never use.",

And even then, it was a passing comment that amounted to nothing. They care way more about actual degrees and professional experience.There is nothing special about learning something from a Stanford professor/ on the Stanford campus vs learning the same content anywhere else. Even the Stanford *degree* only matters because it is so hard to get into. The content learned at Stanford is similar to the content learned anywhere. It's the barrier to entry and the fact that you need to be incredibly talented/ hardworking/ successful just to get in the door that serves as a proxy for the type of person that a company wants to hire. If Stanford admitted everyone who applied (and still taught the same content), nobody would care about the Stanford degree anymore.",

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially. Even if we assume AI takes the first rung of coding jobs, the difficult part of software was never writing code, it's figuring out what we need the code to do, navigating various corporate processes, and knowing that the code we write will work as we intend it. What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.Anyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.Job security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",

Location - heavier cutting in hcol regions, with backfills going to lcol regions. Systematic plans to move to lcol, both within country and internationally.4. Seniority - cutting highly paid highly senior roles and decreasing the ratio senior roles/junior roles. They want more younger employees who have new ideas and are paid less and fewer older employees who are paid more and set in their way.5.

You should be making more decisions yourself rather than looking for others for guidance. I would still expect you to bounce ideas off others from time to time, just the frequency you do this as a Senior vs a Mid level engineer decreases.- Mentorship: As a Senior, expect to provide guidance and Mentorship to more junior engineers. While more independent with your own workflow, you will be expected to be a resource to help other team members when they have issues or need technical guidance.You got this! Just try to shift more towards a team mindset rather than an individual one. This is one of the main things that I had to deal with when I moved into a Senior role. Think about how decisions that are being made affect the team/project/business as a whole, rather than how they just affect you.Gz on the role!",

Any developer or project manager worth their salt knows that there is no perfect developer who can do everything in one go without making any mistakes. No man is an Island. They can hire Linus Torvalds to do it all by himself and there will still be bugs. Also good project management practice is to always have a rollback and disaster recovery plan if it shits the bed.

If a listing has been live for more than two weeks with no hiring manager activity, pops up every quarter with the same wording, and shows fewer than five employee views from the company on LinkedIn, it’s probably resume-fishing. I always DM a current team member asking, \"Did this role open internally?\" – no reply or confusion is a red flag. Also watch the applicant count: 200+ resumes in 48 hours with no status change usually means the req is on hold. Instead of grinding those, push referrals; a thirty-second ping to an alum landed me three real interviews this year. I’ve used Huntr to track applications and Simplify to autofill forms, but JobMate is what I ended up using because it actually submits apps for me while I network. Ghost jobs are real, learn to spot them early.",
