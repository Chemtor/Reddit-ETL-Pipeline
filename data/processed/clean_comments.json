Put unique indexes on keys, do atomic partition swaps/overwrites, and track processed batches in an audit table so reruns are safe.Monitoring that works: alert on freshness, row-count deltas, and schema drift; suppress flappy alerts with consecutive-failure rules; include runbook links and owners. Do canary runs on a small slice before full loads.We used Airflow and dbt for orchestration/transform and Fivetran for some sources; DreamFactory helped by auto-generating REST APIs over legacy databases so ingestion and auth were consistent without custom adapters.Ship guardrails first; the transforms are the easy part once the rails are in place.",

It's as if the vendors don't care about making things easy for the people who build this stuff, and instead take them for granted. If any vendor is serious about helping, they need to stop obsessing over workflows and buzzwords, and solve for things that actually are fragile and never talked about. The hard stuff isn't writing ETL, it is visibility into how data changes across systems, understanding why it broke, making reruns sfae, and keeping people aligned on what \"good data\" even means. Basically, the fundamentals that make a system trustworthy.Until vendors take that seriously, every new \"modern\" platform is just another flavor of the same problem. Some of that thinking is finally starting to shift though, especially with newer approaches that treat tables as publish/subscribe entities rather than a chain of brittle jobs.",

My initial reaction to it was how well thought out it was and how well documented. It felt like a db platform built to address the pain points of battle weary DW practitioners.Throughout my career I've seen \"Tech X is better than Tech Y, why can't people see that\". It depends on whether those advantages are relevant to your business. There are always pain points. What impact, if any, do these have on your business and do they negate the advantages.I worked for a consultancy that was a Snowflake partner. We worked out how to run Snowflake, and other SaaS tech at very low cost. As a Snowflake partner, this made us as popular with them as hemorrhoids in a spacehopper race.What people forget in Tech X vs Tech Y arguments, particularly in the SaaS world, is that both are watching each other, evolving, copying/stealing features. Yesterday, Tech X was ahead, today Tech Y is ahead, tomorrow, who knows?Remember too, it isn't the size of the wand, its the magic of the magician. Lets suppose you can query infinite data infinitely fast. Management take one look at the results, don't like them and send your team off on weeks worth of wild goose chases to determine why the figures don't match their perceptions if what ought to be. Even if you prove the figures are accurate they are likely to insist they are wrong because the data on which the results are based didn't include other factors.",

My most recent job is fully invested into snowflake and it’s so smooth to work with I don’t think I’d take a job maintaining any other kind of warehouse after this.

Now, MS already had a HUGE headstart but they dropped the ball because to achieve optimization on Azure data Warehouse, you had to figure out data distribution, workload management, resource groups etc. With Snowflake everything just worked without hassle. We are hearing more and more about SF because at some point in their journey, SF realized they don't just want to provide cloud data warehouse services but become an E2E cloud platform of their own. And now we see their offerings such as Snowflake notebooks (ML workloads), Cortex Analyst (AI), Snowflake Intelligence, Document Intelligence and more. If your processed data already resides on their platform, it's understandable you get dazzled by these new offerings because it is easy to use all of them and even faster to get a POC out in front of the executives. Word gets spread and so does its popularity.About vendors lock-in, in my experience that will happen with companies with proprietary technologies.",

These two were always an underdog in the general data landacape and value perception. Vendors who ask for the ultimate goal of a change are usualy the ones perceived by Cx as difficult to work with. Data&ai teams are mostly delivery teams, not vision drivers so business searches for shortcuts by themselves (throw a tool at a problem). Question is whether fixing it back down to the core isnt more expensive (and time consuming) than buying some obscure fancy tech (its a question). As you said yourself, things are wrong at their source, dont serve an analytical purpose but rather a kpi blackbox (it works/it doesnt) and now with ai and recent report by deloitte (written by ai) we should expect more shortcuts to be created. Maybe instead of redo, greenfield is the right way to go…",

Raw text stays in object storage, but we snapshot datasets to Delta Lake so every run points at a versioned table; lineage is just foreign keys plus OpenLineage hooks in Dagster. Schema tests with Great Expectations (or Pandera) and dbt contracts cut drift. Ray handles distributed infer/finetune; KEDA scales from queue depth. Watch for long transactions (lock contention), dumping everything into JSONB (hard to join), and backwards-incompatible migrations.I’ve used Hasura for instant GraphQL over Postgres and Debezium for CDC into the lake; DreamFactory fit in when we needed quick REST APIs over Snowflake/SQL Server so schedulers could read and write metadata without custom glue.Treat it like a transactional control plane backed by tables, not blobs.",

Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.Data engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. The decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. More recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse. Policy driven access control and dynamic data masking has changed how data governance is enforced. Snowflake and Databricks are continuing to gain market share. LLM's are changing what needs to be delivered to stakeholders.",

Data engineering is seeing the same uncomfortable growing pains that cloud computing (2008-2012) and frontend development (2012-2015) endured, with vendor repackaging existing alongside real innovation. While medallion architecture is undeniably repackaged data warehousing, open table formats like Iceberg are enabling radical change from proprietary silos to interoperable ecosystems (just like containers enabled a new infrastructure), zero-ETL is eliminating traditional pipelines entirely, and LLM observability is an entirely new problem space that did not exist three years ago. The technology hasn't experienced \"the end of creativity\", its most likely on track for the next paradigm shift, just like React emerged from frontend's \"framework fatigue\" phase to truly alter the landscape (for better or worse).",

Tons of special rules and regulations. And a lot of the other functional areas look like what you're describing. And they look like that despite some legitimate good effort on some DEs parts. And be careful what you insult or call bad practice.

The best solution is to talk with people who know the software and the database (if possible). Otherwise you’ll lose a lot of time.

Break down the problem, isolate the problems one-by-one, and clearly document them. In one of Kimball's books, he talks about the concept of a \"bus matrix.\" It's not totally what you're after, but the idea is very similar.

That's a big jump!Couple of points to your main question as someone who was in your position 4 years ago (almost to the day actually). but TL;DR I'd give yourself some more credit.1) I would not discount the work you do as a wrangler. Did you talk to stakeholders? Did you dive into the data? These things are often the hardest to teach. You know what it looks like when customers have the data they need, you know what questions to ask, and some of the subtle ways things can be wrong. This is very valuable. 2) You mentioned trying to keep up with standard practices at your previous job, this will likely have gotten you much farther than you think. A lot of folks don't really think about these things or appreciate why they are used. Beyond just that, it also demonstrates curiosity, which is very valuable. I'd actually say it's one of the main things I look for when interviewing junior to mid-level candidates. IMO that curiosity will take you farther than anything else. As far as not having a degree goes, the biggest challenge imo is convincing someone to take a chance on you, and you've just done that. That's not to say it's all downhill from here, but the degree no longer matters. I would be surprised if it even comes up the next time you're applying for a job. Keep asking questions, keep reading about best practices, keep trying your best. You'll go far.",

Lock down cloud basics: IAM roles/policies, VPC/subnets/security groups, storage semantics (S3/GCS), and how your orchestrator deploys code. Pick one broken or flaky job, add tests, alerts, and retries, then harden it end to end. For data modeling, define grain and primary keys first, keep naming consistent, and handle change with clear SCD rules before you chase “perfect” designs.Working in a new codebase: learn repo layout, run the full test suite, add tests around any bug you fix, and aim for frequent small PRs. Block time for pairing and code reviews twice a week; ask for on-call shadow early to absorb operational context.

The application logic and authz is also in some cases deferred to the DB in Stored Procedures - a horrendous design driven by a data engineer who didn't/couldn't consider the whole application requirementsThe best skill you can learn is to be commercial, understanding and improving the data task requirements and how to communicate and refine broad tasks from the business.Learn how to understand the domain/problem, application/software/data architecture and understand the tools you have/are available. Then communicate improvements to the plan in planning, spikes, reviews, retros etc. And ensure you know your data modelling fundamentals - you should know when to normalise/denormalise data, implement appropriate SCDs, and the different industry 'best' practices for updating and tracking pipeline tables batch updates. So many engineers in general just do the task without understanding the why or taking ownership.

        "body": "I’ve gone down that road of ditching ADF for pure Python, and the trade-offs are pretty clear.You gain full control and transparency, but you also take on all the plumbing ADF hides from you. Connectors is the biggest gap: there’s no magic “one lib fits all.” It’s usually case by case, pyodbc or sqlalchemy for relational, boto3 for S3, azure-storage-blob for ADLS, google-cloud libs for GCS, requests for SaaS APIs, etc. I haven’t seen a universal package that matches ADF’s connector library.For orchestration, Airflow and Dagster are the go-tos. Prefect is nice if you want something lighter with better DX.Honestly, even GitHub Actions or cron works fine for simpler setups if you’re disciplined with retries/alerts. Hosting wise, containers on ECS/Kubernetes give flexibility, but I’ve also seen folks run Python EL pipelines on Azure Functions or AWS Lambda when workloads are small enough.The headache is always secure on-prem access. ADF’s IR is very convenient, and replacing that usually means standing up VPN, jump hosts, or agents that your orchestrator can reach. That’s the bit most people underestimate.I used to burn days wiring retries and metadata logging until I made it part of the design from the start. You probably already know, but building a little audit table for run\\_ts/run\\_id helps a ton when debugging.Curious are you mostly moving SaaS/db data or do you also have on-prem sources in the mix? We keep hitting this dilemma with clients too, and it’s one reason in Stacksync we leaned into building ingestion + sync as a product instead of fighting with connectors every project.",

The role of analysts was executed by the respective stakeholders who needed the data E.g. the finance team was pulling data with SQL directly from the databases for their own reporting purposes, the risk guys did the same ,etc. If something needed to be automated, changed or structured in a different way, they raised requests to the devs. The people who wrote SQL for data analysis were not dedicated only for data analysis, they were also experts in their own field with a sprinkle of SQL skills. 3. Around 100 people we started looking for a dedicated data engineer and hired analysts within the respective teams that would use the data (again, finance got their own, risk got their own, etc.).",

First, it's a bank. Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.Second, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.Having to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.That said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place. They really are doing shit no other bank can. There are very good teams doing interesting work and very toxic teams where you will get fucked.Just like life it's a mixed bag. They pay well and if you aren't a coward you can learn a lot from those few awesome engineers holding down the fort. Take the money ride the wave and see where it takes you.",

        "body": "I've found the best way to understand your data requirements (and therefore table requirements) is to understand what your reporting requirements are. Once you understand what you need for your reports, you can then build the data to fit those needs. Typically if youre designing data models for Power BI or a lot of other tools, you need to have a model built on Kimball best practices for ingestion into your reporting dataset (i.e. a star schema as much as possible - this sometimes isnt possible due to data or reporting restrictions and you'll need to snowflake).You also need to understand what fact and dimensional attributes you need in your report, and appropriately build facts with the appropriate columns and dimensions with the appropriate columns where attributes directly pertain to one another.The three layers of ETL can vary from this, but this is what I would do:- Staging data - as is from source (or structured into parquet files in a data lake)- Enterprise/silver data - this can depend on what youre planning to have. You could do a inmon style data model, data vault or directly into a kimball structure. Inmon and Eata vault give more flexibility but require a lot more work in building them. While straight to Kimball is the simplest and quickest way of building data. It depends on your businesses skill sets and time constraints. - gold layer - kimball data models with surrogate keysIn terms of pipelines youre main aim is to have the easiest estate to maintain and manage. This to me means having minimal pipelines. This can be done by building a metadata driven ETL making your pipelines parametised and driven by configuration tables. In my experience its best to have configuration tables stored in an Azure SQL DB to allow easy transactional data changes, and ease of inserts and updates. With Azure pipelines you can typically do one extract pipeline (or a couple of parent child pipelines) per source system type and authentication type (e.g. Oracle and Windows auth).Enterprise/Silver pipelines you can have one pipeline.Presentations a pair of parent and child pipelines.",

Use ADF to schedule and parameterize ingestion (Copy to ADLS Gen2 bronze), store schema in metadata, and handle schema drift. Do transforms in Databricks: one notebook per domain or stage, promote to silver (cleaned, conformed) and gold (query-ready), with expectations/tests and job clusters via Databricks Workflows. Bronze is 1:1 with source objects; silver models business entities; gold is per analytic use case-add tables only when a concrete question needs it.Expose to Synapse via serverless SQL views over Delta in the lake; publish a curated schema, add row-level security, and document lineage. For dev/test/prod: separate workspaces/storage, Key Vault, Git + CI/CD (params per env), synthetic data, data quality gates, and monitoring to Log Analytics with alerts. We’ve paired Fivetran for SaaS ingestion and dbt in Databricks for transforms, and used DreamFactory when we needed quick REST APIs for gold tables to feed legacy apps.Net: ADF orchestrates, notebooks transform on Delta, Synapse serves, and everything moves through environments with contracts, tests, and CI/CD.",

In cloud stacks you trade that GUI clarity for scalability, and sometimes the trade doesn’t feel worth it.If you want something closest to that old-school feel, Coalesce is probably the best “modern PowerCenter” I’ve seen. You still end up with SQL under the hood, but the GUI gives you traceability that’s hard to replicate in pure PySpark. Matillion works too but the lock-in stories are real, and Informatica Cloud is… still Informatica, so you know what comes with that. Apache Hop is worth a look if you want open source with a GUI—less polished, but flexible.The reason folks keep pushing dbt is because it hits the sweet spot of modularization + lineage + testing in SQL. Add dbt’s semantic layer or a canvas-style GUI (dbt Cloud if you’ve got budget) and you get part of that PowerCenter experience without losing code discipline.If your gold models are the bottleneck, I’d maybe pilot Coalesce on a hairy one and compare cycle time + auditability against your current PySpark/dbt flows. Sometimes just seeing the impact analysis in a GUI saves hours of detective work.Curious, are you leaning toward vendor-backed tools (Coalesce, Matillion, Informatica) or would you consider open source like Hop or even something hybrid? We hit the same frustration with lineage when syncing ERPs/CRMs into warehouses, and it’s one of the reasons we built [Stacksync ](https://www.stacksync.com/)with audit trails baked in otherwise you lose days explaining how a field was derived.",

It is especially useful for scenarios where the database does not have timestamps, and you don't have other application-level events.Databases store every change that happen to them in some form of a changelog, roughly a file that has the changes applied to a row, sth like this:* table: `users`* operation: \\`UPDATE\\`* id: 42* email: [`old@example.com`](mailto:old@example.com) → [`alice@example.com`](mailto:alice@example.com)CDC is the idea of using this change dataset and replicate the same events for analytical purposes in other places, e.g. your BigQuery or Snowflake.There are various ways CDC can be implemented, the most common open-source software for that being Debezium, which reads these events from the database changelog and publishes them to other destinations such as Kafka. This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.This way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings.

At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.How it’s done depends on the tech. Some databases expose their transaction logs (Postgres logical decoding, MySQL binlog, etc.), and CDC tools read from those. Others use triggers or periodic queries. So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).Compared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time. Event streaming is closer in spirit, but those events are usually app-generated, not DB-level changes. CDC is nice when you want the “truth” from the database itself rather than relying on apps emitting events.",

I was serving a corporate meeting dinner and spilled a whole gravy boat down some important person's suit jacket.To echo what my old manager said to somebody who kept apologising, nobody wants to hear apologies. Everybody just wants to see improvement.First thing is hold yourself to high standards. Give yourself a rule - you're allowed to make mistakes once. Once you mess up, you make adjustments to fix it. I am quite forgetful and give myself a lot to do although I've found writing down a list of actions for a project, prioritising them, and then going through them one by one was great for my organisation.Second is to also be kind to yourself. Care about what you can control, accept that shit happens for things you can't. If you miss an edge case that you can't predict, then honestly, there's no point beating yourself up about it. I'll give you another story - I was getting a user reporting a migration \"wasn't correct\" even though it was 100% exactly the same as it was before. \"I don't see these characters that are appearing before. They're there now. The migration has failed\", they said. If you look at it with the naked eye, you'd be right. They don't exist...IN THE SQL DATABASE. When converted to parquet they show up. Shit was literally invisible to the naked eye and to the IDE looking at the text in SQL, but if you go and look at the fucking location specific character encoding and convert it, it is 100% there.This comes with experience. Some things cannot be helped. Mistakes will always happen. It's how we handle them after which defines us as people.",

I am not sure what you mean here.Are you already using DBT? Then sure, continue using that, and setup CDGC to scan the models, and then you have the exact data lineage in the catalog. As for data quality, Informatica have full-fledged data quality solution, so with me not having used DBT that much, I don't see what Informatica should lack that DBT has, but again, if you already have the DBT models running, it makes sense to continue doing so, and just add them in the catalog. Informatica can get lineage out of many many different systems, so using Informatica as ingestion is not a requirement to get data lineage, as long as your ingestion tool is supported to track lineage. > With new features like canvas and copilot I feel we can make our development quicker and most robust with git integrations.Depends on tradition and existing skills and habits in your organization. You can parameterize everything and template your way out in Informatica as well, though their git support is not always as nice as I would love. > Does informatica integrate well with DBt?Yes.You are however talking about different services. Data catalog is obvious; given DBT's focus on metadata. I see no reason as to why it should not be a breeze, though I have not used CDGC and DBT together yet.> Can we kick of DBT loads from informatica after ingesting the data?Yes. You can execute your tasks on command line or use the API and track the jobs through there if you need. But if you already have an orchestrator, why push that into Informatica? Informaticas catalog can get lineage etc anyway.> Is it DBT better or should we need to stick with snowflake sps? Not sure what you mean. Depends on situation and circumstances.You can use cdgc, data lineage, data quality and profiling in Informatica, without having Informatica to handle your ingestion or transformation. Or you can if you wish. Remember you can go to docs.informatica.com and download the scanners' document on DBT if you you wan't to know what is supported. Or any other systems you might thave, that Informatica supports. If you are to touch these tools you should have gotten an account so you can get the information that is requires an account.

But purchasing Informatica in 2025 is a very \"interesting\" choice. What is the reason for adopting Informatica? As others pointed out, solutions like Fivetran would be far better suited as an EL solution (with dbt doing the T) rather than using an old school ETL solution such as Informatica?Also using Informatica as data ingestion tool (EL) seems complete overkill in this scenario - especially as it is not really a \"no-code\" managed cloud service like Fivetran? And Fivetran is merely just one example of a data ingestion tool you could use - there are plenty of other solutions, ranging from managed cloud services to self-hosted open source solutions.",

For dates, detect formats per column, parse explicitly, store raw and ISO, and flag ambiguous rows. For addresses, split them with libpostal or usaddress, then validate/standardize against a service like Melissa or Smarty; keep an “unparsed” bucket and a small review queue. Talend or Matillion handle conditional logic and mapping fast; push heavy transforms into Snowflake with dbt, and add tests with Great Expectations so bad rows get quarantined. For backfill, run batch by domain, then switch to incremental loads with idempotent models and row-level dedupe keys. I’ve paired Talend and dbt before, and DreamFactory helped expose a crusty ERP as REST and proxy an address-validation call without extra glue code.Bottom line: choose a data-quality-focused ETL, rely on deterministic parsers over GenAI, and test every transform in Snowflake.",

Given you are comfortable and focused on saving time, use a system that:* allows you to import all of the original data and schemas, and* build incremental transforms that will turn that messy data into conforming data. One option is to dump everything into a data platform (snowflake here) and clean it up there, although that will skyrocket the costs. Another option is that you use an open source solution to process this before loading it into snowflake. Options include systems like delta lake and tabsdata. Bottomline is that whatever you do, it should lead to operational dataflows that will continue to work after the current backlog is finished to ensure that the systems stay in sync until the legacy ERP is retired (which, brace for it, may never happen).(Edit: formatting)",

While none of these issues may immediately prop up, they invariably eventually will. Unless you are building a product that can be widely deployed for such use cases (which would require significant over engineering), you will end up making assumptions one after the other that eventually become invalid and cause failures. The solution will eventually lead to more patchwork etc.Another example - what if the requirements, which are arguably very simple now, change down the line. At that time, you may not see it as your problem but your employer will unfortunately.Hope you see the point. Given you have simple connectivity and you are comfortable with python, I strongly suggest looking at tabsdata as a possible open source solution that will help you focus on your domain/ETL logic and can use the connectivity you provide.

Our older colleagues can still use a dwh with stored procedures and we can use pyspark with lakehouses (big big fan of that). Our juniors are loving powerbi, since everything is way simpler than qlik..So I guess it depends per use case.

Ship a CLI that outputs both JSONL and JUnit XML so GitHub Actions/GitLab can surface failures inline, plus per-check severity (warn vs fail) and exit codes. Add partition-aware filters (like lastndays or where on a timestamp) and a tiny state store (sqlite) to track baselines for freshness/volume z-scores. For CSV, consider running via DuckDB so DB/CSV share one SQL adapter, and add a statement timeout and optional EXPLAIN to catch accidental full scans. An Airflow operator and a dbt post-hook would make it drop-in; also support sampling and row\\_count deltas pre/post transforms. For messy schemas, ship a “hints.yml” that maps ugly names to semantics so Claude prompts stay deterministic. With dbt and Soda Core for assertions and anomaly checks, I’ve also used DreamFactory to spin up quick REST endpoints over Snowflake/Postgres that a tester can hit in CI.

I personally don't like having them unnested automatically, because sometimes the tables have too many arrays / dicts, and unnesting all of them creates a lot of tables. I like to control the fields, so if there is a need for unnesting, I like to do it myself. If a column will never be used, it doesn't make sense to unnest it at all.Another reason I dislike it is that, in modern DWHs, you can store JSON, as well as arrays/structs. So if you can store an array in a table, why should you unnest it? Keeping them as is gives you more power than splitting them into different tables.",

Provide a small set of vetted query templates for common asks; let the agent fill dimensions/metrics only. Lean on dbt exposures/metrics, cache the heavy queries with materialized views + TTL, and invalidate via lineage.Handle dialects by normalizing with SQLGlot; add a “safe mode” where the agent outputs a tiny DSL that you compile to SQL AST. Observability: fingerprint queries, tie to user/session, log rows, bytes scanned, and cost; sample results to detect drift. CI: canary prompts per dataset with golden answers and block deploy on regressions. Governance: row-level policies, redact PII before Slack, and cap output size.

Speaking with, what I think anyway, is reasonable knowledge about the UK DE market, people will have a flick through your Github and a competency style interview is more likely than anything else for your first job. So, you should have something to talk about.The easiest way to do that is build something which is interesting to you. Being able to build and solve problems independently by far the biggest and most difficult step, although it's the most important and rewarding.>Also, since I don't have a qualification in the field, I have been looking into the 'Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate' course and wondered if its something I should look at doing to boost my CV/ potential hire-ability ?Certifications are for people with experience rather than people who are new. If you are new, having strong fundamentals is a lot more important because somebody who can quickly pick up how things work is a lot more likely to be somebody who is a valuable contributor than somebody who is sleepwalking through certificates and courses, not really being sure what to do.Only ones I do recommend is do the free AWS cloud course.The next question is - well, how do I stand out? Get on the phone and speak to recruiters. Go and build rapport and sell your experience that way by showing you know more than your CV lets on. At the end of the day, everybody needs each other. They're the gatekeeper who wants to let people in so they can get paid, so it's in their best interest to place you provided you meet the criteria.More often than not, it's giving the recruiter confidence to put you forward more than being 100% qualified for the job. Nobody in the job advert will ever say \"Will take somebody who can program, lives in the UK, and isn't an utter bellend\" although sometimes that's exactly what they're looking for. Only the person in the hiring process will tell you that.",

For BigQuery, we had to push lineage via API/dbt metadata; otherwise you get spotty, table‑level links. Watch cost: cap the Data Map size, scan only curated zones, and schedule weekly not daily. A workable pattern was keeping GCP Dataplex/BigQuery lineage for engineers while using Purview for glossary, classifications, and compliance reporting. If open source is off the table, Atlan or Alation tend to give a smoother cross‑cloud UX and integrate cleanly with dbt/OpenLineage.I’ve used Atlan and Alation for catalog/search, and paired DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST APIs from Snowflake/BigQuery so downstream apps could hit governed datasets without custom gateways.Bottom line: unless you’re leaning into Azure, Purview won’t match Collibra’s cross‑cloud polish-prove value with a narrow pilot and keep GCP‑native lineage in play.",

Note that if anything would to happen where you might lose the Airflow volumes, etc. You can just redeploy the DAGs from OpenMetadata.",

The Dev environment needs to have prod data. My team uses dbt for our sql models, and we configure our dev environment to pull in prod dataOkay, so now you have a dev and a prod SSIS environment. You need to configure your environment variables in the SSIS project. This will allow GitHub later to switch between environments based on the git branch.You can use Github actions to build the ci/cd. The action is just a yaml file that gives github a list of instructions to perform. Here is the workflow. You push code for your local repo, les call it ticket SSIS-001. The ticket changed the column name in a table. When you push the local changes to the remote branch, aka SSIS-001, on the remote server. The Github actions will kick off the instructions. The goal of the instructions is to confirm of the deployment is worked as expected. You will probably want to run some test that check if any of your transformations fail. If any transformation fails, the entire pipeline will fail. When this happens, the ci/cd will stop. This means you can't merge SSIS-001 into prod.So, now you go back on your local branch and fix the issue and push the changed back to the remote SSIS-001 branch. The pipeline passed, and now you merge into master branch. The master branch will run a pipeline that is the same and then push the dtsx package to ssis server and done.Checkout Azure DevOps that might where you want to handle the ci/cd. But if you google github actions or Azure dev ops for ssis you will get a yaml file that will look exactly like how you deploy manually today",

One of the root causes of pipeline complexity is that many platforms (astronomer, dagster etc) force you to handle failure/boundary conditions, dependency management, etc., even when the logic is clean. In other words, a majority of this complexity is just the result of compensating for platform gaps, which ends up destroying maintainability and predictability.My $0.02 - go with a platform that provides a declarative (as opposed to imperative) approach, where you focus on the data flow/transformation, and the platform handles the failures in a predictable manner. * If you are already on databricks, delta live tables are it. * If you are exploring alternatives and want something lighter weight, tabsdata is a good alternative that you can run on your laptop and expand on later. Both these systems will allow you to use your favorite python tools without having to worry about orchestration overhead and failures etc.",

Kestra handles scheduled ELT (dbt), ingestion, and backfills; it’s great for SLAs, retries, and lineage. Our line: if a step waits on external events, lasts >1–2 minutes, or needs compensation, it’s Temporal; if it’s pure batch, cron, or backfill-heavy, it’s Kestra.They coexist well: Kestra triggers a job, publishes a message (Kafka/SQS) with a trace ID, which starts a Temporal workflow; the workflow emits status events back to Kestra for monitoring. Test determinism early in Temporal and keep activities idempotent. For integrations, Airbyte covers connectors and Cloudflare Workers is nice for lightweight webhooks; DreamFactory helped auto-generate REST APIs over legacy DBs so pipelines and agents had stable endpoints.Short version: Kestra for pipelines; Temporal for durable, stateful AI tasks.",

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code. Use SourceAsset for cross-repo dependencies and auto-materialize policies to keep downstream models up to date.Partition raw by ingestion date (daily/hourly), then map partitions downstream; avoid per-table custom partitions unless there’s a real reason. Cap fan-out with multi-asset nodes for shared transforms. Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy. Testing: unit-test asset functions with buildassetcontext, add asset checks for row counts/nulls, and layer Great Expectations or pandera where needed.I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms; in a few cases DreamFactory auto-generated REST APIs on top of legacy DBs so Dagster could pull from them without custom services.Short version: keep core assets static, generate raw assets from metadata.",

The first occurs during ingestion and ensures that the data actually meets the schema requirements in terms of file names, column names and types, and column constraints (like NOT NULL). If this doesn't pass, the data doesn't leave the raw layer. The second is more of a comprehensive data quality check (summary statistics and drift), which is usually performed further downstream and is business-logic dependent. Something like Great expectations or dbt expectations are open-source packages that can be used to handle this. Errors in this part are more subtle and usually indicate that something has changed in the data generating process.In my opinion, the third part, imputation, falls rather into the ML/Data Analytics domain and should be carried out by the data consumers as it is completely use-case dependent.",

You will need to be able to adapt to kind of whatever your company throws at you/wants from you. It’s definitely getting better, tools like Dagster, dlt, dbt (R.I.P. this open source project…) together with [PEP 318](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) (and associated RFP) have really helped to push DE closer towards SE in design and implementation. As such you are best looking at best practices around software engineering principles and adapting to your work.To answer your questions, please see below:1. This VERY much up to you as the DE to decide. The OLTP -> HDFS/S3(-like) storage is a very common use case and as such has a lot of choice for you as the DE. In saying that it’s easiest to usually use what you have on hand/in production already. Have SSIS - you can start with that, only have Python - use that. What you are really asking here is how do I ETL - just google ETL OLTP to storage etc.2. For you (or your architects/plats guys if you have them) to decide, but I personally would want separation of services since I’m not trying to deal with noisy neighbours etc. You really don’t want to add more ways for your Production OLTP server to crash/underperform IMO. So I would recommend a seperate VM/dedicated file server/service with proper subnetting etc.3. Will once again depend on use case, but almost always will be read-replica if they exist in your corp. (You can take this as - Yes, use your read replica(e).4. You will need a VPN gateway (unless you are running some ExpressRoute etc). Also you will need to give the cloud storage a Private IP address (and check subnetting/peering etc) Your network guy(s) will know what to do/should really be doing this for you.5. Just more ETL - this time file system to cloud storage. Once again you decide.6. :person_shrugging: Up to you. I personally don’t use them as they quite expensive and don’t seem worth it to me and my practice, but if your company is on board and you feel more comfortable using them go for it.Edit: I want to point out that it entirely possible to this all on-premise (and open sourced :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:) if you need/the cloud aspect is the most frustrating portion.",

Once the dimension changes, it is overwritten. This keeps nulls out of your dimension which makes querying less error prone.Is this change best captured in the way you are talking about? Would it make more sense to have a “system_value” column and a “manual_value” column, and coalesce them to a “value” column?Have you thought about just doing a type 2 SCD? People are often lazy with SCD, but a “change reason” column is absolutely permissible. You can set your change reason to “manual fix” or something if it comes from your business updates source. Depending on your requirements this may be a more reasonable.",

How much is acceptable.For your other point, I'm just trying to think of a weather fetch logic for trip data, granularity wise it should be per trip but that is where issues arise. The Stations are so close, that if I were to fetch per unique station, I end up with data for two stations that would have practically no variance in weather. How do I solve this? Also Open-Meteo uses a 9Km global grid model which is available for the data from 2017 onwards, and some other models which use 11km, 25, and 50km grids globally with data from \\~1940s onwards.",

Also want it to be able to pull historical data from any range, but the primary aim is to run it once a month, pull the CSVs for the month, then weather data, load it into Postgres and then dbt for transformation. I'll add some frontend (dashboard) as well.Hope this clarifies a few things. Appreciate your response and any help you're willing to offer.As for granularity, that's my issue too, I do not know what is acceptable because I'm not very geographically aware.

For JSONL, stream into a staging jsonb column, then transform with SQL. Parallelize loads per file/table and use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to spot slow transforms.For search, precompute a tsvector column and GIN index (plus unaccent), add pg\\_trgm for fuzzy, and GIN on jsonb if you query JSON. Materialize a “search\\_text” column to avoid on-the-fly concat. Paginate and cache common queries in Redis. ParadeDB can help as data grows, but benchmark it vs native FTS + pg\\_trgm before committing.Airbyte and dbt have helped me standardize ingest and transforms, and DreamFactory auto-generated REST APIs from Postgres so I didn’t have to hand-roll Express routes.Focus on streaming bulk loads and good indexes first; add ParadeDB only if native FTS still isn’t cutting it.",

As a professional who's working in this field, I'd like to kindly pick your thoughts on what entry-level roles I might target to land my first job in DE and what advice you might offer moving forward in terms of career path.I used to say \"just go for mid level\" because there is a lot more opportunity there than the junior market although over time, I think a bit of revision is required:* If you already work in a data focussed job or a job which involves interpreting a lot of data (typical STEM kinds of roles) or already have a programming job and enjoy it, then continue building your portfolio and go for a mid level role. Objectively, if you are somebody who works in engineering or science and spend a lot of your time crunching numbers and interpreting spectra/graphs/lines on paper correlating to values, then mid level is absolutely for you because you already have one part of being a DE drilled in - interrogating generated data* If you do not have any experience of working in a data focussed job (perhaps you're a service worker or manual labourer with a big interest in programming, automation, and data), then start as a data analyst, get used to working with data, and build from thereSo, in your case, it'll be option 2 by the sounds of it.",

You will have a very wide base of knowledge, just deep enough to know what you actually need to do.The most useful in real life for most people is probably DSA. At university, you will learn way more complex DSA than when you are self taught. (I personally also did multiple advanced DSA courses, because I liked the topic)I implemented a partial merge sort (just the merge step, we had pre-sorted data in our database (as JSON, don't ask)) twice. I had to implement a version of A\\* to run on a huge dataset (which was not in a graph database, it was a mess but worked) and I had to write a maximum-flow-algorithm.I am sure a programmer without prior knowledge could have solved all of these issues, but I already knew how to solve them and what I needed to look up (because I didn't do all that by heart) in advance. That's the real benefit: I know what to look up, and when I need it.Other topics that I know \"enough\" about to gain a massive speed boost, should they become relevant, include how operating systems work, how the network stack works, basically all math that will ever be relevant to me, how compilers/interpreters work, and probably a lot more passive knowledge I forgot about.EDIT: You absolutely CAN learn all of that by yourself, but generally people don't (and it takes quite a while longer without good lecturers, tutors, fellow students, dedicated time and pressure to learn things you don't particularly enjoy)",

        "body": "So the *biggest* advantage is getting past the HR filter: In most companies, long before anyone with any coding knowledge even glances at your resume, it goes through HR. Let's say they get 2000 applications for an open posting. They need to cut it down to, say, 10 to call in for an interview. If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.Next to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole \"it isn't what you know, it is who you know\" is at least partially true in every field.Okay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.First is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.In addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people \"self-teach\" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.In terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those. The employment angle and the \"actually forcing you to spend the time and effort instead of just convincing yourself you're learning\" parts are the far more important aspects for most people.",

CS grads may have more theoretical knowledge but they may not have \"industry-ready\" knowledge such as knowing Git, knowing PostgreSQL, building a rest apt, etc. Autodidacts will have a lot of holes in what they know and without proper fundamental knowledge, they may get stuck.However, this is just a generalization: * Not every CS degree holder are the same. Believe me, I've seen some who, all they did throughout their 4-5 years in college was just coasting, only studying in preparation for an exam but never actually grasped what they've learned. Also, there are CS degree holders, in addition to having solid grasp of the fundamentals, also know important software engineering tools such as git, know multiple languages in depth and software engineering principles.* Not every self-taught programmer just knows basic web dev stuff. Some even learn other languages, some learn in depth. And there are self-taught devs who learn the fundamental knowledge (such as Data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, software design, etc). Any serious developer, regardless of their background, will eventually have to learn the fundamentals if they want to stay relevant, and not just someone learning a new hot technology each month only for it to be deprecated the next month)",

Self learning will provide you with core concepts but you may miss out on data structures, algorithms, best practices, industry standards, etc unless someone lists them out lol.On the job front, you'll have to get relevant experience.

People can and do still perform the same kind of \"deep work\" today.In fact, older software was quite primitive in a lot of ways. When we look back on things like early Unix, or DOOM, or HyperCard, it's easy to notice all the advancements that were made compared to the state of the art at the time. But there were also lots of limitations and missing features, because either the hardware wasn't powerful enough, or people just hadn't thought of them yet.And it's not like every developer back in the 80s and 90s was some hot-shot genius.

But you don't keep doing things from scratch forever, so from that point on, one piece of software started building on top of another.And learning? In university you learned maths and the basics of computer science down to the bits and bytes in memory and on data carriers. Then you learned a programming language from books, and used the manuals of the systems you programmed on to interact with the hardware. Most cases, if you wanted to solve a problem, you had to define the algorithm yourself, using both maths and the basics of computer science. Then you implemented it, and tested if it worked.",

It includes:\\- Communication server and client in C - supporting both Internet sockets and AF\\_UNIX sockets for easy testing \\- Packet construction and parsing modules for a custom userspace payload protocol \\- BigInt Math library including not only ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV but more advanced stuff like Montgomery Modular Multiplication, to do math on gargantuan numbers with thousands of digits each.. \\- Cryptography library implementing Diffie-Hellman prime search and shared secret generation, chacha20, blake2, argon2id, stuff like that.After this is done, I'm planning to do a project that has both low-level components like FPGA / kernel modules, as well as high-level components like a website (whose webserver i'll write in Assembly of course, frontend in CSS/HTML/JS) to control the embedded board remotely from anywhere or something.

It gets into an \"operations\" problem.The short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.Long answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet. You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.By _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address. This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.Most (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address. This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)Without this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.With this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)Thus, routers have two different IP addresses. One for \"the internet\" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.Any computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address. This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.So if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.The easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that. Get a domain name, run a server to serve your web page, and put a password on it. Practically every web server will allow you to require a username & password to access a page, so you can just set that and then also give those out to anybody you want to access it.",

And what if you want to store just a date and not a time?Will you store the time zone as number of hours away from UTC? You better not because that’s a mistake. Daylight savings time rules vary from place to place. So you need to store the actual time zone (eg: Eastern time) rather than “UTC-5”.If I put in “October 15th, 2025” and I’m in eastern time, how will you store that in Epoch time?Another fun detail: weekends vary from country to country. Much of the Middle East used to have Thursday/Friday as the weekend. Friday is the day of prayer. But a lot of countries in the region switched to Friday/Saturday so that they would share more working days with the rest of the world. Oh. Brunei is an exception.

Sometimes the available precision is variable.Timezone information has variable context and relevance. Some calendar entries should move when the country you're in changed to summer time; others shouldn't; still others should move when a _different_ country changes to summer time. For any representation, sometimes we want to handle an abstracted representation (eg as an integer), but at others we need to make sure we get a specific element of the localised representation right in a customised way.Basically, date and time are incredibly complicated.Bonus: timezone weirdness means that (in a certain technical sense) a day can be 26 hours long.",

The laws of physics, the laws of a country and the laws of an economic zone aren't even laws in the same sense.E.g. one difference between unix time and UTC is [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). There are a few different strategies to dealing with this on computers, like making the seconds slightly longer throughout the day, or adding a 61st second to a relevant minute, which may be enumerated as either `59, 60, 00` or `59, 59, 00`. All of the options fuck with software that has no clue what a leap second is.Another example: [Sidereal years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year) aren't the same thing as the thing you're used to thinking of as a year (here's a nice [veritasium video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)).And those are just physics problems. In addition you've got all the social problems involved in timezones as the other commenters have gone into.\"Time\" is a simple word hiding a lot of horribly complex ideas. So the implementations wind up complex too.And then usually they get something wrong, or become unwieldy in attempts to become more correct, and are replaced with something that is promised to be more pleasant to use.",

I used Unix Epoch, but like, January 1st 1970 isn't any better than C#'s Epoch of 1AD. People disagree on what date Epoch should be, how to handle dates before said epoch, and what granularity Epoch should be measured in. TL;DR people are always gonna be inventing new standards.

Outside of my work day which occasionally runs long, most days I will go to my non-work desk right after work ends and continue writing software on my own.Sometimes it's a business oriented software with no purpose - maybe building a graph-like database in SQL just to poke fun at how terrible the netbox APIs are for traversing connected devices.Sometimes it's real software for a friend and it helps them with their business. Sometimes that takes the form of scripts to process large amounts of excel data or a simple visual widget to show a number that represents money conversions from a few sources.Sometimes I make games. After work today I'm going to continue work on a board game. A board that is a procedural loop of tiles where events happen as you land on them, kind of like Mario party. \"Practice\" doesn't need to be boring or pointless, you can improve your skills by making something fun. You can even use coding to make math fun - visualize or sample a random math function. Sine wave isn't the most interesting graph to look at, but if you use it to offset the position of something, you get an easy and good looking float animation.Tldr: I've been working for over 10 years, I've been programming for much longer, and whether it's a week day or a weekend I'm usually getting a few hours of extra programming in. That's a lot, but I enjoy it.My professional and optimistic guess is that anyone giving an extra few hours a week will stay ahead of most of their peers.",

So far I'm just on the _tenkeyless_ team, as I find having a numpad means that either the mouse is too far off to the right, or the keyboard home row is off-center. IMO the numpads should be moved to the left-hand side of the keyboard so we could have the home row in front of us, and one peripheral (mouse & numpad) to each side.",

And if it needs to integrate into an existing code base it gets worse. Treat it as a data summarization tool. In general, we’re still learning how best to use this thing. After a couple real years of trying, ROE on AI in business has been objectively abysmal. Programmers who expected a 20% speedup often actually experience a 5% slowdown since correcting AI throws off their rhythm when they could have banged out the pattern on autopilot. This will get better but it’s not a complete revolution yet. Grain of salt and wait for a few more versions.Your main problem is that there’s a glut of grads on the market and fewer jobs due to less cheap investment money.

AI won't steal your job, but it will enable you to complete routine tasks more efficiently. I'd also strongly recommend studying AI integration for your applications.

For game engines, there are plenty of tutorials you can watch.I also learned at 14 in 1998 with QBASIC on DOS. There was no Google and I had a \"secret codebook\" with some simple programming details, and I taught myself from there until I took a class in high school on C++. It's *way* easier to learn now. So yes, I would argue you can definitely do it!The key thing is to start small. Take things one step at a time. Don't add a game engine before you know what a variable or condition is. You don't need to finish the whole [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/cs50) before you open a game engine, but at least a few intro videos can be a big help.For game engines, both Unity and Godot are popular for beginners. Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.Either way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload. If that happens, I recommend taking a break from the game engine and going back to programming basics, then trying the engine again when you feel more comfortable.Good luck!",

But that was a long time ago, there is certainly a lot more, better, learning resources out there now than 15 years ago. And I was less solely focused on game dev, I was more overall into scripting/automation/etc, so that’s not to say its not possible if you put more effort into it; again especially because back then you just had one or two good youtube video series and the rest was crack open the books.. and asking questions was pulling teeth, unlike today with AI, etc",

There are 5 minute - 15 minute tutorials in GMS that will show you how to use the software to make different simple concepts.

For example if you were making a game engine you might build over top of a Graphics Library, an Audio Library etc. Or, if you wanted to stay sane you'd use an framework or engine and have a higher abstraction.

        "body": "Besides AI, nothing much changed in these 8 years.Yes, Java 8 is kind of deprecated now (yes, it is LTS version and will get some updates up to 2030, but still) and if possible, then look into newer Java versions. The current LTS are Java 21 and Java 25.And similar version changes have happened also to Spring Boot and other things.But as we know, the real life shows that companies are still using old versions because most of the development funds go to adding new features and fixing bugs. Infrastructure upgrades are of lower priority for the management level.Maybe somehow big thing was Log4Shell vulnerability that affects Log4J versions between 2.0 and 2.15. If you have any projects using Log4J from these versions then update your stuff. That Log4Shell was a catastrophe level vulnerability. Or, just learn to use vulnerability checking tools like OWASP Dependencycheck or Trivy scanner if you are not doing it already.Other than that, the world is quite same in 2025 as it was in 2017.When it comes to an AI then that is what you need to learn to use. Everything else is just version upgrades.There is free ChatGPT tier you can use. Also Google AI Studio is free to use (better than free ChatGPT tier). Just try it out. See what it can do and what it can't do. I would say that the current AI is on a Bachelor student's level. So, imagine working with a Junior developer. Sure, it is a helpful tool when it comes to debugging stuff, brainstorming, etc. Also when it comes to automating simple things. But do not fully trust its output. Be critical about its answers. Imagine doing a code review to a Junior developer. Like that.More often than not, then current AI that is available to us, is lazy, forgets things (due to a context window and due to an unoptimized focus), sometimes ignores your instructions. Many of the AI tools can access the Internet. BUT it does not mean it will do it. It is lazy. Unless you demand from it to look up information from the Internet it will not do it. It tries to rely mainly on its training data (which can be outdated). It also hallucinates when it does not have an exact answer to something. It starts generalizing stuff and making up answers.So, be critical with what the AI is telling you. It is a useful tool but do not fully trust it. The same way how you do not fully trust Google Search results. Verify over, when possible.You can also use Claude Code that can work with your projects in your own machine. But all the pros and cons of AI apply also to Claude Code. You will tell it to do things and it will then display code changes with a git diff. Then you will either approve, reject, or correct it with your own input on this.Edit: That answer is based on what concerns backend development. Can't give much input about how did the frontend development changed or not, in these 8 years.",

Java is still there in the enterprise (Spring Boot still popular, started in 2014, so you may know it), SQL is still SQL. Also C++ is in demand.A lot has been added, like Git, CI/CD, Docker, Cloud Providers, as stated above, but in many enterprise teams most developers have basic training of these and do not use them every day (maybe except for git). Many teams have dedicated experts for CI/CD pipelines, Docker containerisation or cloud providers.With cloud native companies you need serious skills for cloud, frontend frameworks, APIs, event driven architectures and a lot more.I would also suggest to go for a backend dev position in a more classic organisation, learn the basics of the new tech, and keep learning as you go.With enterprise clients it is not common to check-in AI generated code. People use AI, it’s awesome, but devs still know exactly what each and every line of code does and we still have code reviews (by humans). AI makes mistakes and struggles with large code-bases.",

Those of us who are ESL will very likely speak with an accent but can still be very capable at English, and without mixing languages all the time (if anything the contamination seems to go more the other way when younger people with a smaller vocabulary are overexposed to anglophone memes).Significant semantic differences like that of string mutability should become reflexive over time, though you may also find that your expectations gravitate towards the strictest among the languages you usually use, as you don't get errors for being more conservative than you strictly need to be.There are some things that are more trivial differences that I think you'll just have to live with though, like whether it's `s.trim()` or `s.strip()`, or `len(xs)` vs `xs.len()`. For those you basically just have to have a language server or some other step to catch your goofs. You'll be able to fix it immediately as soon as you get the feedback because you ultimately know the semantics you want and you do know both variants, but made a mistake on the level of a spelling mistake. (And of course it's possible to stumble into spelling mistakes that result in valid grammar with different semantics, just like in human languages.)So I expect that I'll get the case right for `bool`/`Bool` because I can remember that convention for a given language, but I _will_ mix up whether or not it ends with `-ean` because that's not really something I can reason my way into.",

Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.Rather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients. But that’s just an optimization. It does the same *job* as twisting 8 sets of wires together, like the hub was doing. Purely a local-network thing.You can see how this is totally different than inspecting packet headers, consulting routing tables, and forwarding a packet along on its way to who knows where.[I guess that’s a long way of saying that a router routes IP packets on the global network , and a switch “routes” Ethernet packets on the local network.

Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.Real, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers. A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality. But it will also have a management interface, and often it will have some support for network services like ntp, dhcp, dns, etc, meaning it will operate in layer 4-7.Many of the devices called 'switches' you will have access these days also can operate as routers, have packet filtering and so on. Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch. I could take a random computer and put in a few network interfaces in it, and with Linux turn it into a router, or switch. What something is called is more about what you believe the primary function of the device is.> even though switch comes after router. When looking at the OSI model, you must evaluate it individual for every single device between the source and destination. A computer L1-7 will be often be connected to something acting as a switch L1-2, which will be connected to a router L1-3, which which may be connected to another switch L1-2, which may be connected to another computer L1-7.On a typical wired network you will have some kind of physical connection, your Ethernet frames between nodes are happening at layer 2, the Ethernet frames contain Internet Packets, Internet packets will often be TCP or UDP, Your TCP or UDP packet will often contain some kind of application playload.> Im confused on why the architecture was designed in a way so router have to look into higher layer just for it to encapsulate it again and pass it to lower level device.Though it is mostly used everywhere these days, it is very important to remember, that the world isn't just Ethernet. A router can connect different types of networks. A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.It used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.For people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces. Or maybe you'll could have a DSL connection so you'll have a router with a DSL interface.DSL, DOCSIS, frame relay, fddi, token ring and many more are not Ethernet.

Ethernet is what most of us think about and is extremely common in home and business networks. But there are many more. High capacity fiber links, satellite networks, cellular networks, even USB and Bluetooth, all have their own implementations and their own particular way of sending data between devices on those networks. The Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future. The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol. There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not. With IP, as long as devices are able to send an ordered sequence of bytes over a network they can handle IP traffic, and a lot of details necessary for how those bytes are moved in the network are left to the lower layers.",

Once you know the basics, use AI to speed up work (scaffolding, tests, explanations).If you want to learn frontend connection and use AI in development, a practical way is to build a small, deployable app end-to-end. You may or may not follow a course for the app idea. Utilize platforms such as Replit or Lovable or similar, to prototype a frontend for your backend. Those platforms provide code for the generated frontend prototype. Use ChatGPT (or another model) to clarify each generated code block and how it could integrate into your backend application. Write the code(implement it yourself, not copy) in your backend developed application. Reading, running, and editing the code is how you learn. Use AI as an assistant to make your app better. That balance (fundamentals first, AI as an assistant) will make you a faster and stronger developer.",

PHP is much less common in medium/large businesses, whose jobs your probably applying for. They use languages like javascript, C# and Java. I don't know which language is more popular in poland C# or java, can polish afford microsoft products? I know poland is expanding it's military alot, so perhaps they are going hard into microsoft products. On the other hand, if u.s/microsoft pulls the plug on them, it would be better if they used java, so i think java may be the language of the future for poland as being super cross platform it is a more secure investment.",

Honestly you should know way more of java than just parts of the collection packages… Java standard library is big, but not that big, so you should have at-least idea about everything that’s in it… Like imo you should know streams pretty well etc…> My question is: how do I progress after this? All the tutorials online are beginners tutorial and cover everything I already know, but everything else is just \"build a project\" and requires knowledge of frameworks Nothing ever requires a framework… You can do most things from first principles and be just fine (only area where this might be a bit iffy is cryptography and encryption since you actually have to be sort of domain expert to understand all the constant time hacks etc…)> I have never seen and I don't know where to even start gaining that knowledge.

I am willing to learn more but I am kinda lost on how to improve myself.

Use a secure, unique password, with 2FA if possible. Don't fall for phishing attacks that seem like they're coming from your registrar but aren't really.The other is the privacy of your registration information. ICANN requires that all domains have valid contact information, including a mailing address, and that information is made public through the \"Whois\" database system. If you don't want your details to be public, you may want to use whatever privacy forwarding service that your registrar provides. (If you just provide fake info, it's possible that you'll lose access to the domain when the contact info can't be validated.)----Everything else depends not on the domain itself, but what server you're pointing its DNS records at.If you're using a static file host such as GitHub Pages, then there's not much to be concerned with. Any attacks would go to GitHub's servers, not yours, and there's not much risk of a security problem affecting your data specifically. All you really have to worry about is inadvertently publishing information that you want to keep private, but that's true of literally any digital communications.If you were to have your own webapp running on your own server, then you would have to be a lot more careful with security, but that's true whether or not there's a domain name pointing to your server.",

Information about customers, orders and restaurants are all closely interrelated so you’d want them to all be stored in tables in the same database with relations between them.In fact, it isn’t even necessary to have four different apps, quite often you could use the same app and users get a different experience when they sign in based on their role. It’s very complicated to juggle multiple apps and you could always split into multiple apps much later if needed.",

For instance, customer information, doesn't care what restaurants exist, what drivers exist, what drivers are available, etc. So clearly Cx_Info is its own table. Driver information is useful to the customer front end, the restaurant portal potentially, HR/Finance, etc. So again, this should probably be its own table, and accessed largely via JOINs. The restaurant list doesn't care about customers, or drivers. Continue down the line. You'll end up with a bunch of tables, a bunch of JOINs that are needed to process orders, updated the client front-end, etc. but all will be logical. The one I'm stuck out on most right now, is if I'm using a classical SQL database, as opposed to some JSON based noSQL database structure. How do I want to handle individual restaurants menus?",

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).The largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.For some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) 1,010.Basically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",

        "body": "There is an old programming axiom that you think about data when programming. If you can represent the data in a way that makes sense and start with that, it becomes easier to do the rest. \"Great programmers worry about data, not code.\"An example might be, if you want to make a picture editor. The data you want to manipulate is an image. So you think about how you might want to store the image in memory. Maybe as an x/y grid (a 2d array)?Maybe start there, and get it showing on the screen immediately so you know it's working as expected. Then you can start adding other stuff. Don't try to plan and write it all out at once.. get your data on the screen so it's easy to manipulate, and work from there.This can be applied to most kinds of programs.For me, there is a strong connection between computing and humanities. A computer is probably the most powerful artistic medium ever created. Programming itself is a creative medium. But just as you can't write ideas without first learning an alphabet, you have to learn some basics about manipulating bits to wield the power of programming. Variables, loops, functions, data structures. I/O.",

The trick is to treat coding problems like puzzles rather than math questions.Start by breaking the problem into **tiny steps in plain English** before touching the keyboard. For example, if the task is “find the largest number,” write out:1. Read the numbers.2. Assume the first is largest.3. Compare the next one.4. Update if it is bigger. That translation from logic to code is where learning really happens.Practice on sites that start simple like **W3Schools**, **freeCodeCamp**, or **LeetCode easy problems**. Watch a short video, then code along line by line. Do not copy blindly. Change a few numbers, add print statements, see what breaks. That builds intuition.If you want more guided support, **Ashtrix Robotics** offers **online coding programs for students and beginners**. Learners love the project-based format, parents trust the accountable and resourceful teaching team, and lessons are tailored to each student’s level and goals. They have students from over 23 countries, their learners have won national and international competitions, and their mentor earned a Teacher Excellency Award from MIT App Inventor in Boston. You can even ask for a trial class to see if the approach clicks for you.Start small, focus on understanding what each line does, and build up gradually. Consistency matters more than speed.",

Java will run on desktop and natively on any Android device. Python has frameworks and tools that will also allow you to do it. If it’s a web app like browser base JavaScript can get it going. My advice pick something you’d like to do with plenty of tutorials and find a language that matches it. Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. After you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. Personal recommendation:If you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. If you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. I like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. JavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted. It will run on any browser but I’ve only done the bare minimum when I’ve had to use it. Most importantly check back in 2 years when I’ll be advising you that JS is the only way to go, after getting out of bed on the other side or something. But really getting a start on any of them and sticking out the hard parts is the way to go. C/C# for .Net or Java take your pick.",

Something that I see a lot of beginners do is they will want to learn to program and they will jump to a Python course on YouTube and then they're confused as to why they can't code anything after learning the language.Because learning the language isn't actually doing much of anything for you. Syntax isn't difficult, what is difficult is problem solving and that's what programming is at it's core. If you pick up a good book or a good course, that course will not just teach you the technology but how it works and why it works and how to use it. For example, I did CS50 and it's great, it's really good. It doesn't just teach you C and Python and SQL, it teaches you why those tools are useful, how to use them, how to solve problems with them. The course focuses more on what programming is, other than what language are we using this week.I believe that learning how to problem solve and how to write code will teach you so much more than just doing a Python course and moving on. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming and the concepts every other mainstream language will look pretty much the same, of course some of them will have differences big or small but most of the concepts carry over. After learning JavaScript and solving a bunch of problems with it I then noticed that I can easily learn whatever I want now, I had no issues using C++ in college because I already knew the core concepts they were just a bit more low-level.",

This is a great question, and honestly, your plan is one of the most effective ways to learn. \"Learning by building\" is a fantastic approach.Here's my advice, broken down:**Don't learn everything first. Use a hybrid approach.**Your intuition is spot on. Don't spend months on tutorials without building. Instead, use a \"just-in-time\" learning strategy:1. **Build** until you hit a wall or a concept you don't understand (e.g., \"How do I save form data?\").2. **Pause** and do a focused \"deep dive\" on that one concept. Watch a quick video or read the official docs about it (e.g., learn about React's `useState` hook or how to make API calls in Next.js).3. **Apply** what you just learned to your project and continue building.This way, the theory has immediate context and sticks much better.**A Simple Roadmap for Your Gym Tracker:**The \"where to start\" feeling is totally normal. Break it down into smaller, manageable chunks:1. **Static UI First:** Use Next.js to build the visual parts of your app with dummy data. Make a page for logging a workout and a page for viewing past workouts. This gets you familiar with Next.js routing and components without backend complexity.2. **Make it Interactive:** Use React's `useState` hook to manage the form inputs for logging a new workout. Don't worry about saving it yet, just make the form work on the page.3. **Connect to Supabase:** This is a huge step! Set up a simple table in Supabase (e.g., a `workouts` table). Focus on just *reading* data from it and displaying your dummy workouts from the database.4. **Implement the \"Create\":** Now, make your form actually save a new workout to your Supabase table. This is a massive milestone!**How to Use AI as a Smart Tutor:**Your caution is wise. Use AI as a guide, not a code generator.* **Bad prompt:** \"Write the code for a gym tracker app with Next.js and Supabase.\"* **Good prompt:** \"I'm trying to fetch data from Supabase in a Next.js 14 Server Component. Can you explain the best practice for this and show me a simple example?\"Asking \"why\" and \"explain this concept\" forces you to learn, while still getting unblocked.You have a solid foundation and a great project idea. You'll definitely make mistakes, but that's how you learn to debug—which is 90% of a developer's job anyway.You've got this! Just jump in and start with step #1. Good luck",

Pause your project, find a good tutorial or read the official docs on just that topic.

Don't think \"build a gym tracker.\" Think:* **Week 1:** Can I make a Next.js page that just says \"My Gym Tracker\" and has a simple form with a button?

The short answer is: **do both!**\"Learning by building\" is absolutely the most effective way to make things stick, but diving straight into a complex project without any foundation can be incredibly frustrating.Here’s a balanced approach that works for many people:**1. Learn the Prerequisite, Not the Whole Stack.**Your goal is a Next.js app. Next.js is a framework built *on top of* React. Before you even think about Next.js or Supabase, spend a few days learning the fundamentals of **React**. Go to the official `react.dev` site and build the simple tic-tac-toe game or a basic to-do list. This will teach you the core concepts (components, state, props) that everything else relies on.**2. Start Your Project, But Break It Down.**Once you have a basic grasp of React, start your gym tracker. But don't try to build the whole thing. Your first goal should be incredibly small. For example:* **Goal 1:** Create a new Next.js app that just displays \"My Gym Tracker\" on the homepage.* **Goal 2:** Create a component for a single exercise entry (just a text input and a button). Don't worry about saving it yet.* **Goal 3:** Learn how to add that entry to a list on the screen (using React state).By breaking it down into tiny, achievable steps, you're still \"learning by building,\" but you're learning one specific concept at a time.**3. On Using AI:**Your caution is smart. Use AI as a Socratic tutor, not a code generator.* **Bad:** \"Write me a component to log a workout with Supabase.\"* **Good:** \"I'm trying to connect my Next.js app to Supabase. Can you explain the steps and show me a minimal example of how to set up the client?\"You've got a great plan and the right attitude.

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is \"orthophotomap\". They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. Web servers spit out those images as \"tiles\". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless. If you watch your map app you can see it retrieving and displaying tile-by-tile.You can see, especially in more remote areas, the swaths of imagery. Maybe one swath was taken in the spring, and another in the fall. So they look a bit different.The features, I think Google has their own streets-and-borders-and-rivers data. OpenStreetMap.org has a crowdsourced and quite excellent freely available database like that. With nice APIs. Good good stuff. You could make a very interesting student project with it if you wanted to.I once worked at a map-making company that got hired to make a super high rez orthophotomap of O'Hare International Airport near Chicago. Our pilot got an earful from Air Traffic Control when he tried to get them to let him do his job flying back and forth over the field at 600ft above ground level. He had to get the top airport executive and some ATC honcho to go together up to the tower and personally tell the controllers to cooperate. No visible swaths in that job!",

        "body": "This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.Any geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. Of course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent. Anyways, that’s my quick intro, and each of those areas could be greatly expanded upon.",

        "body": "The first thing to learn, especially for someone with ADHD, isn't actually a programming thing, but rather an organisational problem-solving thing; it's \"divide and conquer\": you need to learn how to split big tasks into small enough sub tasks that they're trivial. You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.Focusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.This is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.The second thing to learn is \"make skeletons\" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.For your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.At any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (\"Agile\" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).There are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",

I like the struggle (masochist >,>)\" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.Second piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think \"Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break\" I write that down in this list. 2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like \"Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week\".3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.By keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. Also, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project. For that reason, I try to keep a list #1 and #2 for each project I have, and I store them in the project itself, so they're always nearby.Hope that's useful!",

Use short work sprints (25–30 minutes) and take breaks so your brain doesn’t get fried. Keep a log of ideas you want to do but can’t right now store them in a “parking lot” so they don’t distract you mid-task. Review weekly: see what worked, what stalled, and replan your next week. **Little wins build momentum, and direction comes from consistency, not trying to do everything at once.**",

        "body": "I think it's important to distinguish between a project being open-source and a project being commercial. They're not mutually exclusive.There are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.There are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the \"top\" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They \"lose\" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you. So if you just want to share and not create a business, then this is fine.",

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",

I believe that feeling lingered well into the 2000s and then enterprise dev shops wanted to cut costs (we used to pay for things like compilers and IDEs and web/app servers, everything). One way to do that was to run java on linux and run more open source, yes even in the enterprise.the enterprise folks who ran stuff previously on Sun systems and the ones who used to run MS Windows Server systems both were able to run application servers (there used to be soooo many of these app server products) running java on linux.

I got my first internship in game development right after my final year. At that time, my skillset in game dev wasn’t very strong , even though I had been learning it on my own for almost a year and had even taken a course at university.Anyway, once I was surrounded by senior developers during my internship (which later turned into a job), my skills started improving rapidly. I’m a passionate person, and having great seniors around me helped a lot. I took their mentorship seriously, never hesitated to ask questions, and treated projects personally. I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.After just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.So in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.When you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that. Starting from scratch alone can easily frustrate you because you don’t get that sense of achievement. Seniors usually have strong foundations, so when you learn from them, you learn the right way.",

You are competing with people(new grads) who have degrees with equally or better portfolios and possibly internship/CO-OP experience. These people will also not only just know the languages/tech that you mentioned, but they would also know computer science fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, OOP, etc. Obviously, most new grads are not experts in these things, but I’m just giving an idea of what you’d probably be up against. Related to that, you would have to learn leetcode, which is most of the time, not extremely relevant to the job/position, but usually required to pass an interview.Yes you can learn all of those things yourself, but to add onto the issue of no degree, a lot of ATS résumé scanners used to look for candidates will immediately filter out people without degrees.So, most people will suggest that you get a degree if you are serious about getting a developer or adjacent position. Not only would you learn important computer science concepts, but it is a good chance for networking and will help you to land a job.Obviously, this is not guaranteed advice, as now, even new grads with internship experience are struggling to find jobs. Yes, you can get a job while self learning, but it is extremely difficult. So if you are serious about this, I would at least consider the idea of going to school, or try self learning first and see if this is something you want to pursue even.",

I also have terminal ADHD.I firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.Random notes in no particular order from what you've said:* You're \"supposed\" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often \"get\" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to \"just keep trying\". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax! Too many junior devs treat their health like shit and then are surprised when they feel like shit. Your concentration and working memory are already compromised by a neurological condition - don't make it worse.I think I've rambled long enough - please feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)And as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.For *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.If the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be \"good\" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data. If it gets lost, or stale, or corrupted, it's extremely unlikely to cause any kind of inconsistency or bad behavior; the worst that will happen is redoing unnecessary work.",

It's just a very non-linear, low-guarantee path to it.2. From my understanding, this would put you in competition with people with 4-year degrees, and even the fresh grads here are facing friction.3. The general consensus I've noticed is that pre-2020, these were good, but they aren't as competitive anymore. While yes, people make it work, the tech workforce is still largely made up of 4-year degree holders.4. Again pre 2020, this was more viable. I would make the caveat that with this you can make your own luck freelancing on sites like Upwork. If you're persistent and lucky, this could pan out in the long term.In short, optics aren't great atm for entry. If a good friend asked me what you are, my gut feeling is pescimism and feeling tired just thinking about the time it took me and people I know to break in. Hope this helps.",

Everyone is just making slop, everything is a scam.Something like law is much more in demand I believe, and you can pursue all different kinds of sub-career paths in law, you can work for a corporation, the government, yourself a small firm. There is always gonna be demand. You can do actual meaningful work. I'm sure it's very difficult, more difficult than software in a way, but much more fulfilling if you do it right. Just my 2c.",

But I don't know any simple language that enforces side-effect free functions, immutability and referential integrity.React does not and cannot enforce this, because JS doesn't enforce this. But react still requires these constraints to be satisfied in order to function properly, the way it was designed.Way too many people jump into react, they discover useEffect on their first day, and then they write absolute atrocities because they think of it in procedural style, which is what useEffect allows them to do. And then react gets a bad rep.",

If it is a relatively simple CRUD application then it does not need microservices. If it has distinct independent parts that function separately from each other and serve a specific purpose, then you can consider building microservices. You can go first with multimodal monolith and see how it works out. If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.You can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. MQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.gRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).In terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.There is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it. With multiple microservices/monoliths and/or multimodal monolith, you are also likely to encounter either some of the MQ tools or Kafka. But as I said, use it in your project when it makes sense to use it. Do not just drop any and all kinds of technologies into your project. It will be an unnecessary technical bloat. Your client will not pay you for stuff that serves no actual purpose (sometimes he is not willing to pay even for meaningful things/upgrades).",

For those not familiar with shell scripting, this course provides an overview of common Linux Shell Commands and shell scripting basics.It sounds like it will cover the basics, but it will also go deep into using Bash as a full-fledged programming language, which is probably overkill for what you need. And, after you finish it, you will probably still be left confused about some of the Python- or application-specific commands for running different repositories, which are probably not built-in Linux commands.If you'd like to focus on the problem that you mentioned, I'd recommend simply Googling the specific commands that you're confused with, and spending a few minutes learning about each of them. I imagine that terminal commands will never become your main focus in programming, and so this way, you'll simply learn about the ones that you need.However, if diving deep into terminal commands and Bash scripting is still something that you're interested in, the course definitely does seem helpful, so definitely do go ahead and take it if you're interested.",

You can type in them, use the mouse to select text in them, but it’s basically a text thing.Inside the terminal, you are usually discussing with a shell. That is a program that takes your input and acts on it. The form you give to that input, the language, is characteristic of the shell.On Windows, the shell today is PowerShell. You get a terminal with that by clicking on the >_ icon somewhere. You can write scripts to be executed with PowerShell, so that you can use its power without having to type everything repeatedly.On Linux, there are a number of different shells, but most resemble the original “sh”, and “bash” is indeed one of the best known. As with PowerShell, you can write scripts, and learning to do so is quite worth the effort if you are going to study CS.You can certainly also use bash on Windows, but I think you have to install it.I hope this helped to clear up the basics.",

        "body": "The One Definition Rule says there can only be one definition of a function or method. `inline` grants you an ODR exception. C++ also recognizes \"normal\" functions and \"inline\" functions.Beyond that - `inline` doesn't actually mean much. It's SUPPOSED TO hint the compiler that call elision is preferred (don't generate a function call, just instead integrate the inline function body directly into the point of the call), but the compiler absolutely does not have to honor that. Hell, even non-standard compiler extensions like `__forceinline` STILL won't guarantee call elision, simply because it's not always possible.In practice, the compiler internally maintains a list of the two different function types, and when using heuristics to determine if a call should be elided, it will pick either a more conservative or more ambitious value. These values are always adjustable as a compiler parameter, so you could just set both of them the same, so that EVERYTHING is elided just as aggressively as everything else.Yes, this implies that even normal functions ARE candidates for call elision, `inline` doesn't grant that like a special power.I should also point out that a shitload of function types are all implicitly inlined, so an `inline` decorator is strictly redundant. Template functions and methods, for example.So why do you want an ODR exception? Because C and thus C++ do not have whole-program compilation. Every Translation Unit is an island, wholly isolated from all others. If you want the COMPILER to elide a function, then the COMPILER needs the function definition visible IN THAT TU, in order to decide whether to elide it or not, and also just to HAVE the statements that it is eliding there and then at compile time.In order to get the function definition into every TU, you need an ODR exception.And suddenly templates make a hell of a lot of sense, because when you `std::vector`, or whatever, you implicitly instantiate that template in every TU as a concrete type - it's compiled into object code into every object file - how else could you do that without an ODR exception? (Hint: there are ways - advanced programming techniques that also cut down compile times.)---So normal functions are considered for call elision, too, and you can fuck with the heuristics without fucking with the source code.Also - since C++ doesn't have whole-program compilation, that means we don't get TYPICAL Whole Program Optimization. But we DO get A version of WPO, and it's called Link-Time Optimization. It's strictly inferior. What the compiler does is it decides to bundle the compiler flags and source code in the object file. When the linker comes across these bundles, it invokes the compiler. With the linker's perspective, the compiler can decide whether to elide a call or not.So now you don't even NEED an ODR exception to get the benefit of call elision, even across TUs.But I can do you one better: unity builds. Basically, you configure your build system so that ALL your source files are included into ONE source file, thus making a SINGLE TU. This has the effect of putting all the source code in the same scope at once. The compiler can do a much better job at compilation, heuristics, dead code elimination, and reduction than you can get with a link step. The machine code and object code is superior to an incremental build with LTO, and less error prone. Unity builds are preferred for smaller projects ~20k LOC or less, and that number grows with faster hardware, and they're preferred for release builds, since you're always going to build a release from scratch - no cached object files. Incremental builds are ONLY useful for dev cycles on large code bases.So this basically renders `inline` useless. For every reason you would want it, there are always better ways to leverage first. Always configure a unity build - and in 30 years I've never seen a reason not to. Do prefer to fine-tune the compiler from the configuration, not the source code - what is good for one compiler is bad for another. Let the optimizer do its job and don't assume you're smarter. If the optimizer can't figure it out, your code is more likely bad than the optimizer is dumb. Don't be hinting the compiler from the source code. YOU don't know WHAT compiler I'm using, so get outta here with that shit.Oh, and we have profiler driven builds, where performance is measured from a test build and the heuristics is catered per function. At that point `inline` heuristics are irrelevant.So the only thing we can guarantee about `inline`, the only thing we know it's good for, is an ODR exception, and so you have to ask yourself why do you want that? What technical problem are you solving for by turning off safety, that's better than being protected? So far, I've never seen a use case.If you see `inline` in source code, you've got some developers with some dogmatic beliefs, because indeed, there was a time - in the 80s and 90s from which I hail from, that compilers and optimizers were indeed FUCKING TERRIBLE, and YOU WERE smarter than the algorithms. But that's just not the case anymore. Even new developers come up incorporating what they're being told without EVER critically thinking about it or reading about it or looking into it whatsoever.And yet people are attracted to C++ because they \"really care about performance\" but cannot accept that this belief in particular is dated and wrong. Yeah, dogma won't get you there.",

With programming its a bit differnt very few employers will be impressed with raw code, most people doing the actual hiring are human resources not tech usually so having something that showcases your projects actually working like a website with pages displaying a sort of tech demo of some project you are proud of, and it can be nice to also have your resume on there (although you might want to limit your contact info on the website resume), as well as a bit about you. Things that work good for your portfolio website is you want to focus on well designed landing page, you want it easily navigable to different parts of your website, you want things to be snappy, and for projects links to source code and maybe explanations of things will be a good idea. You can think of the website itself as a project, and its typically something you host on your own, either self hosted or on some web hosting platform.",

No client-side JavaScript, but you will get a feeling of how various bits and pieces of web stack fit with each other: HTTP headers, response codes, data submission, database connections and SQL.Once you've done that you can switch things around a bit: add client-side JS, switch requests from form submissions to JSON and `fetch`, switch to JWT for auth, make the client part an SPA. That would be your *Web 2.0* milestone.Only after that I would suggest moving to *Java* and trying to repeat *Web 1.0* and *Web 2.0* milestones. Java and Spring do a lot of things about overall project structure, architecture, testability, etc. And if you jump straight into it you will be overwhelmed. Node will help you see quickly how different bits fit together and this will help with covering basics of language-independent web stack.",

If you are finding it difficult to translate CLRS algorithms, to your language, then it most likely means that you don't yet know the programming language well enough.

Syntax is just the tool we use to bring our solutions to life.So, you want to build a workout routine app? Perfect. What’s the big problem here? It’s something like, “Creating a program that allows you to track your workouts and even generates workouts for you.”But that sounds pretty overwhelming. Where do you even start?That’s where breaking things down comes in!!!!1. Creating the ProgramAlright, now we’re getting somewhere. Fire up your IDE and create a new project folder. Maybe call it WorkoutSmart, or whatever the heck makes you happy.2. Tracking WorkoutsOkay, so how do we track workouts? Are we taking user input? Sure thing! Let’s build a simple flow.User flow example:1. The user types a workout into the input field (for example, “Push-ups”) and clicks Submit.:down_arrow:2. The workout is added to the program, either in the background for now or visually on the user interface.:down_arrow:3. Add buttons for Sets and Reps, each with an increment counter.Nice! Step two is coming together well. Push your progress to GitHub and call it a night. :ZZZ:3. Keeping Workouts on RefreshThe next day, you might notice something. When you refresh the page, all the workouts disappear. :frowning_face:Bingo. That’s your next problem to solve.Now it’s time to make the data persistent.You might start Googling something like “how to keep data after page refresh JavaScript” and build from there.As you gain more experience, things start to click. You’ll begin to recognize patterns and might even plan out an entire project in Notion or on paper before writing any code. The plan will change as you go, but it gives you a solid blueprint to follow.I hope that all made sense.Honestly, I think this approach is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. When things feel overwhelming or anxiety creeps in, break your problems into small, manageable pieces, and calmly tackle each one.Happy coding!",

Using that web framework, write the most basic application, one that just loads the home page with the text \"My first web app\".4. Get that most simple app working.5. Now go to your to do list and pick one of the items from that list. Try to implement that feature. If you get that feature working, cross it off the list, otherwise just move to the next item in the list.6. Rinse and repeat until you've managed to cross off all the items from your list.Using YouTube or any resource found on the internet is fine and will not be cheating. Just don't be tempted to turn to something like ChatGPT or any other AI tool, as that would be cheating and you'll end up learning nothing.Also expect things to go slowly at first, but what you should find, the more you try the better you'll get at solving problems and faster things will go.Don't get discouraged when thing get tough as this is to be expected. When you do run into problems try to use google or YouTube to solve those problems. Problem solving is a skill that is needs to be learned, so this practice will make you a better programmer.",

        "body": "> why do we have to create an object in main to reach classes?A class definition only defines a type. Let's look at an example: class weight: std::tuple { static bool valid(const int &value) { return value >= 0; } static int validate(const int &value) { if(!valid(value)) { throw std::invalid_argument{\"value cannot be negative\"}; } return value; } friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &os, const weight &w) { return os (w); } friend class weight_extractor; public: weight() = delete; explicit weight(const int &i): std::tuple{validate(i)} {} weight(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight(weight &&) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(weight &&) noexcept = default; auto operator (const weight &) const noexcept = default; weight &operator +=(const weight &w) noexcept { std::get(*this) += std::get(w); return *this; } weight &operator *=(const int &i) { std::get(*this) *= validate(i); return *this; } explicit operator int() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } explicit operator const int &() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight) == sizeof(int)); static_assert(alignof(weight) == alignof(int));This only tells us what a `weight` IS. It gives us the semantics of a `weight`. The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`. class weight_extractor: std::variant { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) { if(is.tie()) { *is.tie() << \"Enter a weight: \"; } if(int v; is >> v) { try { we = weight{v}; } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) { is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit); if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) { throw; } } } return is; } friend std::istream_iterator; weight_extractor() noexcept = default; public: weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete; operator weight() const { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight)); static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));The semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.The `weight_extractor` is an example of \"encapsulation\", aka \"complexity hiding\" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. \"Data hiding\" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding. weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept { return l += r; } int main() { weight my_fat_ass(190);See? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too. if(std::input_iterator iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) { weight your_fat_ass = *iter;You will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value. auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass; std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << \"lbs.\\n\"; } return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE; }In C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.So to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",

If you're using C++ in an object oriented way, the memory for those objects will need to be allocated somewhere. There are different storage durations (e.g. static, dynamic, automatic) which define how long the memory lives (e.g. entire program, custom lifetime, life of stack frame, respectively).

        "body": "This is a fantastic post! You're asking all the right questions and thinking about scaling issues exactly the way a senior engineer would. Your thought process is spot on. Let's break down your ideas and offer some simple, effective patterns.### 1. Handling Click Events (Analytics)Your idea of using Redis as a buffer for bulk updates to Postgres is an excellent and very common pattern. You absolutely do not need Kafka for this. That's like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame.Your proposed solution is the way to go:* **Request Flow:** User hits the short URL.* **FastAPI:** In your redirect endpoint, perform a single, super-fast Redis command. An `INCR` on a key like `clicks:` is a great way to just count, or you could push a small JSON object with metadata into a Redis List (`LPUSH`). This operation takes microseconds.* **Redirect:** Immediately send the 302 redirect response to the user. The user experiences zero delay.* **Background Worker (Celery Beat or similar):** Have a scheduled task that runs every minute (or 5, or 10, depending on your needs). * This task scans for the relevant keys in Redis (e.g., `SCAN 0 MATCH clicks:*`). * It grabs all the data, processes it, and performs a **bulk insert** into your Postgres `clicks` table. * It then deletes the processed keys from Redis.This pattern is great because you get the speed of Redis for the user-facing request and the durability/querying power of Postgres for your analytics, all while keeping your database load low. You've correctly identified the \"fast-ingest, slow-drain\" problem and found the right solution for it.### 2. Handling Sequentially Related Operations (Deactivation)You've dived deep into background tasks, versioning, and reconciliation jobs. These are all valid strategies for complex systems! However, for this specific problem, there's a much simpler and more powerful solution that avoids eventual consistency issues entirely.**Instead of changing the data, change the query.**When a user deactivates their account, you only need to update a single row: `UPDATE users SET status = 'inactive' WHERE id = :user_id`.Then, when your application looks up a short URL, just join the `users` table and check the status:```sqlSELECT urls.long_urlFROM urlsJOIN users ON urls.user_id = users.idWHERE urls.short_code = :short_code AND users.status = 'active';```**Why this is better:*** **Instantaneous:** The moment the user's status is 'inactive', all their links stop working. There's no delay or waiting for a background job.* **Atomic and Simple:** You only perform one simple `UPDATE` for the deactivation. No complex transactions or background tasks needed.* **Solves the \"Flapping\" Problem:** If a user deactivates and then immediately reactivates, the state is always correct. Your query will simply start succeeding again. No race conditions with competing background jobs.* **Massive Write Reduction:** You avoid potentially thousands or millions of URL row updates. This is a huge performance win.This pattern of checking related state at \"read time\" instead of propagating state changes at \"write time\" is incredibly useful and can simplify your architecture immensely.### SummaryYou are on an amazing learning path. Your instincts are leading you to real-world architectural patterns.* **For Clicks:** Stick with your Redis buffer + periodic bulk insert plan. It's the perfect middle-ground.* **For Deactivation:** Use the \"check-on-read\" pattern by joining to the user's table. It's simpler, faster, and more robust.Keep up the great work. This kind of deep thinking on a hobby project is what separates good developers from great ones",

        "body": "I mean it sounds like you already have a query language which is capable of expressing the complex queries you want to do, namely SQL. But for some reason, the external system is rejecting the **valid** SQL queries that you want to do, because of unexplained \"security concerns\".I don't think inventing a new domain-specific query language, instead of just using SQL, is going to address your real problem. The real problem is how to **efficiently** extract only the subset of the data that you need from your underlying database, when you're being forced to go through a layer that is trying to prevent you from doing that. If you did come up with a custom query language, then you would just have to translate it to SQL anyway in order to actually execute it, right? (Since Lucene's query language is nowhere near sophisticated enough to express what you want.)So I think the answer is going to depend on the specific details of the restrictions that the system is imposing on your SQL queries.For instance:> Pick this one if its status is \"open\" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.It's fairly straightforward to express this with a SQL query involving nested joins. When you pass a query containing joins to the DB, the DB can optimize based on the details of what you're querying and the available indexes, so that it doesn't fetch more data than necessary. This is crucial for efficiency.What is the specific limitation you're running into when you try to write such a query? When you say the system rejects \"complex queries\", what is the actual definition of \"complex\" that's being used?For instance: Suppose the system doesn't allow joins at all. Then you would have to implement your own query engine which queries tables individually and then joins them together (e.g. using a hash join). This will almost certainly be much slower than letting the DB perform the join itself. In order to mitigate the performance cost as much as possible, your query engine needs to decide what order to perform the joins in, and it needs to \"push down\" the join criteria to become filters on the individual table queries. (Of course, you will be limited in your ability to do this because you don't have access to all the low-level data that the underlying DB engine does, such as index statistics.)If the actual restrictions you're facing are different from \"no joins allowed\", then you would have to design around those other restrictions instead.But the *implementation* of this join engine doesn't really depend much on how you *express* the queries that you want to perform. So for expressing the queries, you might as well stick with SQL, or at least a limited subset of SQL.",

Define a small JSON AST with and/or/not, cmp ops, exists(relation, where), and count(relation, depth, op, value). That lets you say: risks where exists hazard with category = biological and count(descendants, depth=2) >= 5.Performance: don’t hit the source for complex logic. Set up a read replica you control. Either a graph DB (Neo4j/JanusGraph) or SQL with a closure table/materialized paths for ancestor/descendant counts. Sync via CDC (Debezium or Airbyte), precompute transitive closures per project, cache id sets, and stream rows with keyset pagination. Batch relation lookups using a DataLoader-style layer to avoid N+1.I’ve used Neo4j and Debezium for this pattern; DreamFactory helped auto-generate REST endpoints over the replica so the UI could query with OData/RSQL consistently.Main point: adopt OData/RSQL plus a graph-capable backend and a small JSON AST with exists/count.",

I think learning how a language works or architecture in general on a project becomes much more interesting and intuitive when you understand truly how it works, and why you’re writing what your writing, AI can do this great! It’s literally a teacher that doesn’t get frustrated. Use it like that. Before you write anything or use a certain framework for an assignment or project, you should understand exactly how it works and why you would use it. You’re only cheating your future self by having do all the work for you. On top of this. The better you understand code architecture and languages, the better and more efficient your code can become. You will be able to start calling LLMs out on overly complex code and hallucinations Because you understand what’s wrong intuitively and NOT just because your code isn’t compiling or passing test cases and it’s making you angry lol. There is a dangerously fine line that’s easy to jump between cheating yourself and use a tool to efficiently learn",

Yes.Pls explain to me how can it be any more complicate than this? Balance bullshit? You literally get to decide what you want to learn and not to learn.

Based off that, I had the impression that people wanted the answer right away and I was anxious about not having the answer quickly. However, radio silence or leaving them on read makes your coworkers think you were goofing off or that you didn't understand their request. Very obvious in hindsight, but people would prefer a quick, prompt \"I'll look into it this afternoon, it'll probably take me a couple hours\" with the actual answer the next day. Giving them a time estimate and an acknowledgement that you've seen their question is good for you because it makes them realize it's actually a pretty involved request and that you had to put a lot of effort into finding them the answer.",

Even at my previous company (where I was mid) I really didn’t see a big difference between mid level and Sr, and I’d imagine that’s the case at most places. Mid level is an awkward role tbh because you’re expected to work at Sr level to be promoted and you don’t have a lot of room for mistakes as you’re no longer a Jr. In reality, you get paid less than a Sr to do Sr level work anyway, especially if your company considers Sr the terminal level.YMMV, but I would consider leaving for a comp increase and a title change once you’re at mid level anywhere. If you’re currently mid level, try interviewing for Sr roles, they’re not that different.",

In fact unless you're the rare 1%, you probably should be putting up less PR's as a staff, senior, etc. then you do as a junior.That's because your job becomes more and more about improving the quality and speed of the devs around you. Devs on your team should be moving tickets faster with you there.The reward becomes harder to see and it's not for everyone. You'll have less days logging off feeling great because you finally solved a problem that's blocking a release, but more quarters feeling good because you identified and shipped a solution that enabled 2+ projects to deliver quicker.

You need people who can guide other engineers, break down hard problems in a way that are tangible to less experienced engineers, and mostly when you’re building a piece of software, it’s rarely greenfield, but more about building a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in a larger ecosystem, so you need to talk to other people (who own the other neighbouring pieces of your jigsaw puzzle) to make sure you design the piece in a good way, and these skills are hard to come by, a combination of tech competence, understanding the system well enough to be able to decide the direction you want to take it in, is a harder skill than people understand. In reality it does sadly look a lot like jira tickets and docs/slides, but youre not becoming useless, unless you’re being passive, because you’re (somewhat) in a driving seat.",

        "body": "There's some meme somewhere about junior devs wanting to be invited to more meetings and senior devs wanting to not. The progression is natural, but you can carve your career a bit based on your own goals. If you want to maximize career growth, you have to align yourself with business goals and impact, and the way to do this is rarely to output more code but instead be a multiplier- train up other devs, lead initiatives, set up processes to streamline things. Part of this may in fact be figuring out ways to trim down meetings but still maintain same output and quality. This may mean you decline meetings that aren't useful.Alternatively you can also drive impact by being very technical and the expert on one technology. At my internship (circa 2017) Docker was still somewhat new and some guy named Sheldon learned about it at a meetup and introduced it to the company and he was the \"Docker guy\" who people would go to get help.Or you can choose to just focus on doing what you want to do and not min-max career development. My first job out of college was low 6 figures, and feasibly that was enough to never \"career develop\" again from financial aspect. If you are financially where you want to be, then no reason to let the corporation decide what you get out of your \\~8 hours a day you're giving to the company.",

Are you struggling? Are you delegating correctly? Are projects being delivered?

For mobile tech stack I know they used paid apps to make it harder to check. When an interview was gained they had the “subject matter expert” sit on the interview to feed answers in case an unexpected question arose.It was probably one of the better “mills” but before they dropped the bombshell that all our experience would be made up we had to sign a two year contract stipulating that if we left while under contract we’d owe 20k or 20% of lost profits if on project, whichever was more.Another fun thing was that they had people pretend to be us on screening calls, we only ever talked during actual interviews. All the references were also employees who’d give glowing reviews or pretend to be managers from the companies we never worked for.They billed at 120+ dollars an hour but, talking to the other guys, our pay ranged from 22 to 31 dollars an hour",

Cite past failed deployments made by this DevOps as reasons for why to change the current system.Rather than perform deployments, the DevOps team would create the tools or system that enable you to do deployments without direct access to the system.The DevOps are frustrated because they have to deploy code they didn't write. I guarantee you, there are times when your deployment instructions or post-deploy verification steps are lacking, because no one is perfect. So rather than focus on which \"false bugs\" they filed, be a professional and ignore it. Come up with plans which prevent the DevOps from accidentally applying the wrong config file. If it's not your job, you can propose the activity to your and the DevOps manager.",

Required sections: Summary, impact analysis, timeline, the analysis and recommended actions to detect, prevent or mitigate future occurrences of similar problems. You don't name names, your don't blame, you get to the root cause and figure out how to stop it. Commit to your boss to write these yourself, on top of your regular work, on the condition that 1) the docs are reviewed as a team, during which the final list of actions is agreed to; and 2) s/he commits to making time to execute the agreed-upon actions within a month.

For context, I’ve had similar situations with startups where I’m hired for a project, I complete it successfully, and then I’m laid off to “stay lean”. This has happened multiple times, good feedback, good relationships, good work ethic and productivity, it’s just market shifts and the company trying to be strategic. I had to get clear about what I wanted… and that’s stability. I started looking for opportunities in stable, but growing sectors, i stopped taking interviews with small companies or companies known for their leanness or competitive firing practices. I reached out to people at the company to know what type of culture I was signing up for. During the interviews, when they asked me what I was looking for, I told them… a stable place to grow in my skill and to develop a long-term relationship with a company. This may sound sexist, but I looked for companies that had a lot of women and parents on their team and good paternity leave… to me, this is a signal that the company cares about investing in people rather than the bottom line. If they’re willing to hire women (who may be out an extended period after/around pregnancy) or parents (who have stricter schedules and can’t do the 9-9 grind), they believe in investing in people rather than the short term setback of human life being inconvenient. I looked for companies that didn’t do boom/bust hiring waves. How long have jobs been posted? How many jobs are posted? How frequently do they post? Does this company have a history of downsizing? I think the world has definitely changed a ton since Covid. The market doesn’t reflect on you as a person. If this is the issue, the best thing you can do to adapt is be ahead of the trends.",

The strategy I implemented when I was choosing a job this last time around is to NOT go to a company where the product is strictly digital. The reason is bc a company can just decide to pivot or cut a digital product too easily. Therefore I was looking at companies that have a physical product. The other thing to look for is companies that operate in highly regulated industries especially where what you will be doing will help them meet regulations, esp new ones. Businesses that get their revenue from making sure their customers can meet regulations always have work if those regulations change frequently. It's hard bc these types of jobs will not pay as much as tech jobs. They'll be overly boring and frustrating. But think of lost income from being in between jobs. You'll have a lower salary but less gaps so over 5 years, it might even out Also just to be safe....never tell anyone you're looking for another job except if it's a coworker you're close with and you don't want to blindsided them. Always try to appear cheerful and optimistic. Don't be the squeaky wheel either. Sometimes it pays to be a \"yes man\". I don't agree with these things but I've also found some of it out the hard way. Some managers don't care about doing what is best for the company... they'd rather get rid of someone who is trying to \"make a difference \" bc it's too exhausting to deal with them.",

First of all, you’re treating H1Bs as a monolith, when in reality, there’s two “tiers.”The bottom tier H1Bs don’t work directly for big tech. They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. On the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. You’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.We issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. Why do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked? It’s insane. Both sides of the immigration “debate” in this country are fucking unhinged. Guns and immigration are the only two issues where I’m an obnoxious enlightened centrist, I swear…",

I'd try to not even put social science on my resume if at all possible. My instinct tells me people would see that and move on but I'm not a hiring manager and never have been. PhD in CS would be better and talk about the stats and computation. Papers you published could def be interesting talking points in interviews depending on what company you're applying to.",

Where do the authors of the publication you cited in your dissertation work? Are there consortiums relevant to your specialization? What does your advisor think?It naively sounds to me like universities, government, nonprofits, foundations, think tanks, news publications, international development, intelligence services, market research, etc. would be the sort of places an expert like you would be able to work on societal impact. Some companies have OSINT intelligence analyst types that might have some crossover. This really does sound more social science centric. I’d expect you to be publishing reports, not pushing code.If you are looking for a more traditional computer science or developer path, you’ll probably have to reframe everything. I’ve worked with a number of nontraditional PhDs in engineering orgs, but there is a stigma that these folks won’t be able to perform uninteresting tasks as assigned based on the needs of the business.Good luck! :four_leaf_clover:",

A couple thoughts that may help from what I’ve seen:Need to look at companies that are solving macro problems such as smart mobility, health insurance, public utilities or even large consulting that operate at a large city/state/country scale. The tasks that you excel at are typically handled by “data scientists” in the research or engineering subteams of the broader product team. Most of the time it’s run through a platform like snowflake with some basic trendy algos applied and then call it a day, with little interpretation or understanding of the results.As strange as this sounds you may want to hunt for UX Researcher roles. If you dig into the requirements a lot of what they are asking for there is a lot of overlap and it at least is adjacent to your skill set. One of the hardest things, as this thread has shown, will be articulating your value. Most hiring managers for these roles will have come up through a more vanilla CS background so having a paragraph ready about what the current state of the industry is, why it’s leading teams and products astray and how your deeper understanding makes a difference will be critical. You are a PhD level data scientist who looks at the world through a sociology lens and that brings inherent value.Lastly, the job market actually is pure ass right now. It’s all of us and not just you. If you have any folks from your cohort that went private sector they probably have some good advice on how to modify message for what folks are looking for now. Sadly keywords matter more than concepts in the initial stages.Good luck and you got this. Hope all this helps.",

Get them to use a screen sharing tool to make a quick box diagram of the architecture or components, how they relate. Prod them for all the minor details you can to make sure they aren't just bullshitting and have meaningful knowledge.Like yes, GPT messes up quiz questions about \"how do undefined and null differ in JavaScript\" (who gives a shit?) but it's not going to let them *convincingly* fake knowing about a whole system architecture or what makes it well designed.And frankly if they can use LLMs to properly solve challenging programming tasks then cool, that is itself a skill.

And I do the same. But I get it. It's an attempt to be objective. Still, I don't think it's really that useful. LLMs haven't really changed anything, IMHO.Here's what I really did, at least when I was still in the office.Let me talk to them. It can even be over lunch.  We just have a chat about their last project, or any project they want. It can be academic or professional. It can be a Pokemon fan site. I don't care. Preferably something they are passionate about, especially for the earlier career folk.Low stress. I'm not trying to trick you. Explain it to me. Let me ask some questions. There aren't even right or wrong answers. It's about communication, and clarity, and a depth of understanding. Use a napkin and draw something out if it helps. If I'm doing it right, it should be the easiest interview they've ever had. It hardly feels like an interview... I'm just like a slightly overenthusiastic fan of their work. I'm trying to help them demonstrate all the awesome stuff they have done. It's not a sales job. There isn't any benefit in them practicing to prepare. The questions I ask are all over the place and are specific to their project and their previous responses. I'm intentionally asking questions that will let them demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge. It's not a prepared slide deck they could practice with. The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. Practicing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. I've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre. I've also lied about a candidate who failed his whiteboard session miserably because they were nervous, hadn't prepped and hardly communicated anything, but during our 'culture fit' spent 45 minutes convincing me that he was an experienced developer who didn't do well under pressure. He was a great hire. I'm old, and he's actually progressed further in his career than I have. Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a decently long chat like this with someone and thought 'Wow, they really know their stuff' and been wrong.",

The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.You can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI. All you need to do is ask a bunch of questions around the solution to see if they know what they're doing. Overall, just remember that you're trying to hire someone, you're not trying to catch someone out who can't remember a certain method on the spot, that won't tell you anything other than your process is an act of gatekeeping. If you judged a fish on it's ability to climb tree's you'd believe it was stupid so ask yourself if you're setting your candidates up for success.",

Great in theory, but every time I start a new project in it instead of writing code, I feel an urge to look for a new job.

You start to question the meaning of life and the purpose of your life.

More common than not for junior/mid-level engineers to be classified as low income in the Bay Area. Millions in unvested stock? In 2025?! What nonsense. A lot of them would be lucky to have $100k unvested.- Many of them see the writing on the wall. Maybe they haven’t gotten the PIP yet, but they see the future work drying up, and they know the stack ranking is probably coming for them next. You don’t seriously believe just because they’re extremely talented that they could never be PIPed, right? PIP is not based on merit. If you got hired at one of these companies, your performance isn’t the issue. PIP is based on bean counters setting quotas to meet quarterly cost cutting targets to pump the stock, without triggering the WARN Act.- Some people are genuinely, deeply unhappy at large companies, and enjoy the startup chaos. It’s like asking what’s wrong with ER doctors, when they could’ve been cardiologists instead and worked half as hard for 4x the money.- Some people have something Bezos could never have: enough. I mean, if you played the FANG cards perfectly, you could be a millionaire by the time you’re 30. At that point, how is more money going to make you any happier?- People often make big moves like this because it supports their life in some way.

Sometimes it's because father passed away and they need to take care of their mother who is alone in China, etc.Anyways I replied in one of the comments but just so that it's more easily accessible for other high school/college students to see: why do you think people jump off the bridge and all?Some jobs literally kill you. Mental stress is no laughing matter. Just because you never experienced it does not mean it is not real.At the most stressful time, I literally woke up at night and could not even feel my legs let alone move them for a few minutes. And that happened twice. Shits scary as f. Suddenly the world view changes and you care nothing else at all when your legs might stop functioning. Your body actually breaks down from stress itself. You tell me if money is worth losing your legs.People vastly underestimate how scary extreme mental stress is. I know in one of the startup talks one of the founders stated that he had a period of time in which suddenly his eyes stopped working and he had trouble seeing with his left eye from all the stress. And that's when he stopped everything because anymore stress and he would lose his left eye functionality.So yes. People leave stressful jobs all the time. Stressful jobs can legitimately destroy your body. Just because stress is mental does not make it any different. Human body will legit break down after a longer period of extreme stress.When you are a college student and never actually worked these stressful jobs all you see is numbers. You have this delusional belief it's high pay or basically homeless (wtf?). That's not how reality works.You only live your life once. Don't waste your life chasing solely money. Money is important to function in life but once you are in comfortable means of being able to provide yourself, food/healthcare/shelter/etc, then other things take priority. It's great if your job pays a lot and you enjoy it and all but that's not the case for everyone. For others, the high paying jobs are legitimately destroying their happiness. And ask yourself is this the life journey you want to take? Something you would be proud of doing looking back a decade from now?",

All the new grads, all the people taking bootcamps/self-teaching trying to break into the industry, and all the people that have been in the industry for a little bit of time but not enough time to be very attractive as a candidate. It's a cesspool of desperation.I stuck it out at my new grad job until I had \\~3.5 YOE. During my job search I did 10 applications, got 3 interviews, and 1 offer in the span of a month. My new grad job search was nowhere near as easy as that.Keep in mind it's not a hard rule or anything across the entire industry, and YOE isn't the only metric companies use to evaluate resumes. Some candidates might start having an easier time at 1-2 YOE, some at 5 YOE, some might never have an easy time and will struggle until the day they retire. Crossing an arbitrary YOE line doesn't instantly make someone an attractive candidate, and not being past that line doesn't mean you'll have a hard time.",

Now it's more about what sort of experience you have. In the past they'd say they didn't care if you worked with their exact stack, as anyone can ramp up to a new stack, but now there's so many developers begging for work that they often are looking for their exact tech stack in your experience, so this is why stuffing your resume and cover letter with tech stack names is so important. If you want to make your future job hunting easier though, I would suggest expanding your network, keep in touch with previous colleagues, and be friendly, happy and positive at work so everyone thinks \"I love working with them!\" There is no silver bullet for job hunting, the more different parts you do to make it easier, the easier it will be overall, but it's unlikely to ever be \"easy\" unless you're very lucky or have a great network filled with people working at companies that are hiring.",

I think industry roles often have a similar level of pressure / slog to academia’s “publish or perish.” Plus a lot less job security, and a different type of politics which can be exhausting. The other consideration is that it will probably be easier later on to go from academia to industry if you change your mind, than vice versa, especially if you’re going to a non-research industry role.Context in case it’s helpful or you want to ask questions: I left my phd program a few years in without completing it, for an industry job. I’ve had a good career so far, and it’s been fun and interesting and I’ve learned a lot (mostly interpersonal stuff and management skills), but in retrospect if I’d had a real option to continue the phd and go into academia, I would have. I don’t regret the decision because personal circumstances made it the only reasonable option. But sometimes I’m sad about that.",

My burn-out wasn't from research per se, but from the feeling of doing research alone. Working in an industry AI lab has completely changed my relationship with research. I am in a significantly more collaborative environment. The flavor of research is quite different though, but turns out I find math-circlejerk research (theory-heavy) and simple-at-scale research (experiment-heavy) equally fulfilling. There's a certain joy to pulling out a seemingly random idea in literature that, with the right clever modifications, ends up working well in practice at O(10k) GPU scale.\\- The main downside to industry, imo, is politics/drama. The AI industry is rife with them at the moment. You'll also sometimes look at what your company is releasing product-wise and question whether you're on the right side of history.\\- You definitely lose out on the mentoring/teaching aspect in industry. You will meet the occasional brilliant researcher fresh out of undergrad/masters that you can take under your wing. But it's significantly less frequent than as an actual advisor.\\- Are you sure you'll enjoy being a research professor? Your main job will be to write grants and steer your lab's research agenda, not actually teaching students, unfortunately.",

        "body": "Not a CS PhD, but I did elect to leave academia for an industry SWE position after a year as a postdoc, much to my old advisor's disappointment. Like you, I was burned out and had gotten tired of the publish-or-perish race, even though I'd been told that if I were to stick it out a while longer, I'd have a really great shot at a TT position. There were some other factors for me that you likely do not have to deal with, but I don't regret pivoting to industry. To directly address some of your concerns:* On flexibility: * Yes, most industry jobs will afford you much less flexibility in how you schedule your daily life. However, industry also pays you a fuck ton more money so that you can actually enjoy your time off. I don't know about your finances, but when I was in academia, I basically didn't take regular vacations; my \"vacations\" were always tacked onto conferences and involved me blowing off one day of talks and/or staying a day longer before flying back. * It is also much easier to change jobs in industry, which affords its own flexibility; I know people keep moaning about the industry job market, but it's still way easier to jump jobs than to jump institutions if you happen to hate where you're forced to live. TT positions are not a dime a dozen, and you may need to take what you can get; if you don't like the location, then you're likely gonna be shit out of luck for at least a few years. (This is assuming you don't have to do the postdoc hazing ritual that involves moving every 1-3 years.) * WLB in industry is much better than in academia, and at the end of the work day, you can disengage from the work. Even if you're on-call, you don't really need to waste brainpower on it. In some ways, I feel that while I have lost some flexibility during the weekdays, my time off is much more my own. Being able to spend time guilt-free on my hobbies has improved both my physical mental well-being tremendously, which itself feels like freedom; I honestly didn't even really know how unhappy I was in academia until I left. * At $400k-500k, a high savings rate, a smart investment strategy, you will have the option to retire in less than a decade, which would afford you the maximum flexibility.* On being able to work on what you're interested in: * I won't lie. Some of the work can be **very dull**. However, as you get promoted, you'll hopefully find yourself in a position where you'll be addressing larger business questions and architecting solutions, which I have found to be relatively engaging. I mean, I don't really *care* about the subject deep-down, but I also can't say it's boring. * With a CS PhD and a specialty in a hot field, you can keep applying to jobs and try to pivot to a research-focused industry position, which may be more up your alley.* On teaching and mentoring: * Not gonna lie. I really miss teaching. Mentoring new hires doesn't scratch the same itch. With your degree, you do have the option to pick up an adjuncting gig, and I've considered it, but I'd feel bad about taking a job away from some poor sucker who actually needs it. I've thought about going back into teaching once I have enough FU money. But another option might be teaching or tutoring folks for free at local libraries if you've a mind to do it and don't mind teaching basics.I have many friends and a sibling who have remained in academia in TT or postdoctoral positions. I chat with them regularly. Academia does have its pros, but having spoken with them, I don't think I would've been happy even at a TT position. Happy to speak more, but this post is getting long, so feel free to just DM me if interested.",

Like my manager sent me videos of the new system they were trying to integrate and asking me to watch the videos. I should've known how that was going to be the second he sent me 10 hour long videos and i hadnt even started. That job was so stressful that within month 1 it was like they wanted me to be an expert at things already as a mid-level.\\- current job is also big tech but not as big as 2nd company. They have been super chill. Like another commenter said, it took me 2 weeks to even get credentials enoguh to build and they were telling me to slow down that i should take my time before i really got into the code. 6 months in this job has been super chill but challenging tat the same time edit: forgot to add. I this company is already expecting you to be a high level person, especially if you are a mid-level or below (maybe even a senior) then this job sounds like it will be stressful. At most if you were a principal i could see why because you are being paid expecting that you already know things but you dont sound like you are that far in your career.",

What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.But technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.I'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.That being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore. The expectation became that I was the mentor.",

At this point if you are making 300k in TC, it's just a question of what's the difference in career advancement and what's the difference in work life balance. Emphasis on the latter. Becuase i money chased into FAANG and spent 3 years feeling like i couldnt have a life.",

Map stakeholders: who approves, who can block, who just needs updates; name an alternate if someone is OOO. Log decisions and tradeoffs as lightweight decision records (ADRs). Estimate with ranges (P50/P90) and list assumptions; keep a change log when scope moves. Set up a 15-min adjacent review with owners of neighboring systems before you commit a schema or API. Digest the codebase by tracing one critical request end to end, build a thin vertical slice, and use tools like Cursor/Sourcegraph to surface patterns. We used Postman for quick contract tests and Kong for gateway policies; when we had to expose a legacy SQL schema fast, DreamFactory generated the REST endpoints so we could focus on design.

Any intense field carries this risk.To avoid this, you need to figure out what motivates you, find a way to chase it at the company, and just keep your head straight. Everybody gets burnt out when you just endlessly chase reward but come up short, you're brain learns it's not worth it. It's just reinforcement learning. Also, even when you feel like shit, it really pays to find it in yourself to put the work in, try not to care, and move the ball. It's not a game of inches, but one of miles.Personally, I've had a pretty good run chasing impact, and not caring about anything else besides helping my team.

After a year, start looking for something else, job hop and increase your pay that way. Personally, I started out at a really low paying job. But I worked my butt off. I learned the entire stack (building a server, configuring the network, building code, testing code, creating the CI/CD pipelines, deploying the code, [get blasted for not testing well enough], iterate on the code, redeploy, maintain the code. Then as time progressed, I learned more about micro services, cloud tech, load balancing and ways to handle very very large amounts of data. I got to the point where I knew the entire pipeline of the entire setup, I was then able to communicate with customers about what was possible and know how to fix stuff when things broke. If you want to be the person everyone goes to, you need to gain the experience and know how to solve complex problems and more importantly be able to communicate the issues and ways to solve it in a way the customer understands.",

They either aren't aware of the current state of the job market and/or got hired during the boom times when they were handing out engineering jobs to anyone with a pulse.

Since every company is different, this can be challenging. For interviews, there are two main options. - LeetCode and System Design- Being comfortable with live codingBoth have been discussed quite a bit, so I won’t go into too much detail. For the work, I think finding a mentor without having an existing relationship will be very hard. I graduated over 2 years ago, and I had some random people from my university try to cold connect for jobs via LinkedIn. I had a million things going on in my personal life, and when I circled back, they never replied. I think you just need to build things. I’ve learned the most when something didn’t work or got broken and then fixed it. You can find tutorials/courses on how to set things up. They’re not perfect, and quality varies greatly, but what else are you going to do? Hope you can find a stranger with enough free time who is also good enough to give you free training? It does happen, but I think it’ll be very hard to find. There’s more info available than there ever has been. You can even use LLMs for some high-level guidance. Don’t wait for a perfect situation or hope someone will spoon-feed you. You might be able to find info/guidance in domain-specific subs, but you have to be careful, as there is a lot of advice out there.",

        "body": "I’m a principal engineer at Salesforce. For those looking to join Salesforce as an IC engineer-1. Know that they made it REALLY hard for engineers to get promoted after April 2023. They’ve added a metric called “biz justification” wherein the manager has to justify why your promotion is justified from a business/operational perspective in your org. They use this easily defer/reject your promotion for YEARS.2. The environment at Salesforce isn’t “chill” anymore, in general. Some teams are still chill, but the company pivoted to a high performance culture last year. PIPs are on the rise. Many engineers are working 10+ hours.3. RSU refreshers have mostly stopped, except for very high performers and PMTS+. The engineering management takes all the RSUs, leaving very little for ICs.4. There’re re orgs every few months. An acquaintance of mine was hired into one team, went through a re-org a month after joining and was put in a completely different time with a completely different tech stack. He’s miserable.5. RTO is 10 days/ quarter for US engineers and 36 days/quarter for India engineers. The Indian tech leadership is fighting to make it uniform for everyone, so who knows what’ll change. Also, it’s possible they start tracking how long you spend in office using WiFi info. The office space is extremely small compared to the number of people coming in. You'll be sitting elbow to elbow, with every person beside you in meetings, distracting you.6. The company is trying to brand itself as the biggest AI enterprise company, but internally, it’s a known embarrassment. They simply take one product, rename it and repackage it. They’ve done this thrice to the same product now. The AI models developed in house are a joke. The good ones are simply wrappers that call OpenAI’s APIs. They’re good, but the company doesn’t disclose it (it doesn’t need to), but it parades itself as some great AI visionary. It isn’t.7. Another pain point is there're too many manager levels - Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Senior Director and VP. The first 4 just talk all day with almost zero understanding of the actual tech and contribute to red tape between teams. The politics is crazy.8. Product management leadership is another problem. The actual PMs are pretty intelligent, who went to innovate and get stuff done. The VP+ in PM are extremely laid back and lack vision. As a result, you'll see our competitors bang out features. A year later, Salesforce PM leadership lists all those features, takes the top 2 or 3, asks engineers to implement it and then pat themselves on back as being innovators in the CRM space. They aren't.9. If you're on the main engineering tech stack (called 'Core'), you'll have a horrible time. It is a huge monolith. Skills won't be transferrable.10. Some orgs (called \"Clouds\") are much more toxic than others.So - come here only if you've no other place to go",

You should understand how the parts fit together though at a high level. Masters is basically a waste of money IMO. Look at what FAANG/unicorn interviews expect and try and learn that stuff, that’s how you’ll get the most money if that’s something you care about. System design is one part and it’s basically just backend design, then there’s Leetcode, and behavioral stuff that every interview has.

Those areas always need people with deep technical skills. If you’re curious about scalability or APIs, you might like cloud backend or DevOps. If you’re interested in lower level work, roles in networking, embedded systems, or high performance computing could be a nice fit.So instead of trying to learn every new framework, focus on one path that builds on your strengths. For example, if you stick to backend, you could start learning about databases, cloud platforms (like AWS or Azure), and maybe some Python or Go to round things out. A Master’s is not required for most roles unless you want to go into research, data science, or academia. Experience and strong project work usually count more than another degree.

So you provide them with optionality.So my professional opinion is that you should focus your learning on what interests you most, and explore various domains. As you know, the field is also evolving extremely quickly, so it's nearly impossible to predict what will be in demand. Better go with your intellectual curiosity ;-)I know that it's a bit frustrating because it's not a clear answer, but this is the common approach I've seen in people with successful careers.I hope it helps!Emmanuel",

Cloud, networking, cybersecurity, and even data are all being enhanced by AI, not replaced. For example, AI tools might automate small tasks (like monitoring servers or cleaning data), but people will still be needed to set things up, make decisions, and handle complex problems that AI can’t. The folks who understand both tech and AI will actually become more valuable.Once you build up a tech foundation, it’s pretty easy to switch paths. If you start in cloud and later want to move into AI or automation, your cloud knowledge will carry over. Same with data as if you learn Python and SQL, you can pivot into analytics, AI, or even DevOps later. So you’re not locking yourself into one lane forever, you’re just building stepping stones.",

He's just moved to a pretty amazing house there. All I can say is, it's bigger than mine here in the UK haha.I have no idea if the streets are paved with gold in the USA. I do know I have relatives out there that have visited us throughout my growing up for weeks at a time. Sometimes they look at us like we're mad when we talk about things like TV licenses, parking permits, how much a tank of fuel costs. I have been out to America for work on several occasions and I would say that we are foreigners separated by a common language. Some good, some bad, it's definitely a different flow to life. Basically, what I would say is that nobody is going to take your British passport off of you. If you're young enough, go for it. Working out there for a year is not going to cause you any harm and if you want to stay and know the bits and pieces you need to achieve residency, go for it. I would say, it's a better idea to go out there, try it out, if you like it, hurrah. If you can't stand the place, well. It's only a plane ticket!",

Generally rule of thumb is higher paying the job the worse the company culture is. However, my experience in tech and finance is there are a lot of high paying chill jobs out there its just a matter of landing in one. I am a risk quant (kinda like data sciencE) so I straddle the line of both industries.2. Do you have a visa problem, given the current political environment in U.S. it might be hard to get a work visa.3. People will talk about health care and other benefits possibly being better. These people are usually talking out of their ass and have not lived in multiple countries. Generally health care in U.S. is through the employer and most corporate a jobs have reasonably good health insurance and often better many ways in Europe i.e. specialist visits and the like. What America's problem is the the quality of health insurance is entirely a function of where you work and what plans they offer and generally poorer people do not have access to high quality health insurance either due to it beign cross probhibitive and for small businesses they may not offer it (for example a small restauarnt does not have to offer health insurance to their workers if they employ fewer than 50 people). What you will find in America is if you are in teh top 1/3rd you are substantially better off than anywhere in Europe or Canada, and if your in the bottom 1/3rd you are substantially worse off. The middle 1/3rd is ???. Software engineering is one of thsoe occupations where you are generally in the top 10 percent.4. For salaried jobs for mid career professional the normal vaction in software engineering, data science, ML would be something like 4 to 6 weeks of vacation.5. Atlanta is a boring city relative to London or NYC. Just keep that in mind. I've lived there. I also think if your career ambitious you probably will consider somewhere like austin, new york, seattle. I have lived in Atlanta and know the city relatively well. It definitely is somewhere that you will need to drive etc.",

Angry employees don't tend to give the most honest, or \"fair\" reviews. Someone who just got fired for bad performance usually isn't going to go on Glassdoor and write a review that says \"Got fired, my fault, great company though!\". They're going to do everything they can to drag that company through the mud.Positive reviews are the same way. Those usually aren't very genuine either. HR often encourages their employees to leave positive reviews while they work there. Those won't be genuine either.An anecdote of mine, I was considering joining an established startup, and their Glassdoor had a bunch of reviews complaining about nepotism, and how if you aren't buddy buddy with the CEO, you'll never get good raises or get promoted.I didn't get that vibe at all when I spoke with my hiring manager, the team, a manager from another team, and the CTO. So I joined them anyways.I stayed at that company 5 long years. I got *several* of the biggest raises I've gotten in my 12 year long career there, by a pretty huge margine. I got promoted twice, including to Senior, without any action or politicking on my part, they were handed to me on merit unprompted.I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work. I don't like to chit chat, I don't like going to company happy hours. I certainly wasn't buddies with the CEO or CTO (or anyone for that matter). Doubt the CEO even knew my name. The CTO and I spoke once in a blue moon. I just went into work and did my job, and then left. And yet, huge raises, multiple promotions.Pretty sure the people that were leaving those negatives reviews didn't get good raises or promotions *because they didn't deserve them*. So they blamed it on nepotism.",

This isn’t 2020 anymore, you most likely won’t land a dev job because you know a bit of react. If you genuinely want to become a dev, do the comp sci WGU degree, get CRACKED at leetcode/system design, have projects under your belt and showcase it to the world. If you genuinely become cracked than nothing can stop you, the issue comes when you think doing the bare minimum will still get you a good dev job. Btw don’t do any of your core credits at ACE credit places like Sophia or study.com, only knock out your generals from there.

That's on top of your pay, let's say you get 180k. The receipts well tell you your \"total comp\" is 380k and he is telling the truthButAfter 4 years your RSUs end and your pay reverts to 180kHow did they not lose every employee at that point? Well every year they give you some rsus. But if they only gave you 100k every year for 3 years then your RSU after 4 years will be 300/4 or 75k a year, much less (math simplified here)So if your 3 years reviews are not above-average, your pay will decline",

You know how scammers try to rush their victims into making unwise decisions with a false sense of urgency? It's a technique that works. And it works really, really, really well.You're doing that to yourself right now. You're creating a false sense of urgency for yourself that doesn't actually exist. Kids, a partner, other life responsibilities ***do not*** mean you suddenly can no longer travel and your entire life is put on hold.A couple whose wedding I went to not long ago just had this first child. Wanna know what they did pretty recently? Took a 2 week vacation to Europe. They brought the kid, but *also* arranged for people to take care of their kid so they could galavant around and do \"kidless people things\". And I know people that have children that just leave them in the States and either get a parent to watch them or hire a babysitter.I will never understand the people that just put their entire lives on hold as soon as they have a kid. If that's what having a kid is like, I never fucking want kids. But luckily I have plenty of examples of people I know that have still lived their lives to its fullest even with kids. Hell, that couple I mentioned beforehand? *They travelled more than me that year*. I'm single, with no kids. And yet somehow, with a newly born child, they travelled more than me. They're living life right.I know I didn't answer your question at all, and I introduced even more questions... so apologies for that, but I think your perspective is creating a lot of issues in your mind that don't need to exist. This isn't a \"now or never\" situation. Your career shouldn't be an ultimatum of \"I can only take extended breaks when I'm unemployed\". You can have a balanced life, and a balanced career, without reaching for extremes.",

The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.So if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage. Keep in mind these percentages include all the non-eligible candidates which are all automatically filtered out.",

Even if you aren't writing code, you are probably weighing in on design choices, diving deep into high-profile operational issues, or helping teams with disagreements, all of which require understanding technical areas - someone without that understanding usually does not do well. The other thing I've seen in my own career is that while I have gotten more senior, things have mostly shifted from depth to breadth. There was a time where I knew everything about my area: if you had a question about how to build a Java app using Spring storing data in Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB or Mongo, that used Maven as a build script - I probably knew the answer (and still might, at least for whatever old version I used back in the day). Now, the set of things I weigh in spans a very broad set. As a result, in a lot of rooms I do not have the most detailed knowledge of the topic at hand, but I have a ton of context about a whole bunch of other things and how the particular decision fits into 53 other decisions we as a team are trying to make.>it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped.There are two different reasons why this might be. On the one hand, at larger companies the consequences of getting something wrong are much higher, so it is worth it to make sure that component gets shipped the right way. On the other hand, it could be that, yes, you are suffering from bureaucracy. If you've ever had the opportunity to work with a really senior IC though, one of the things they can be great at is figuring out how to remove unnecessary bureaucracy (and navigating needed bureaucracy).",

Most fin-techs operate more like tech companies, but as they've grown they are starting to build out some of those risk and compliance functions. Some of them act as vendors to banks and are effected by bank regulations due to having to provide turn key solutions, so they are effected by model risk functions. For that reason they are familiar with banking background and more likely to also employ people from the banking space.Also as someone whose been in quant model development at large banks, its very common to exit from mid-tier banks into Big Tech. You just need to brand yourself more in the tech lingo and bank acts. Certain banks wear the tech company cosplay like capital one and its relatively easy to move from those places. I've seen people of all levels move from banking to tech from model validation or quantitative model development, usually in some kind of data science role.I also think some of this is how you sell your self. I mean lets be real what is teh difference between model risk and AI risk conceptually?",

When you find out what they're going to be go and at that point try to work out every question that you're going to need to ask about the work.Ask those questions early and then by the time you actually come to do the work the answers should have been provided. If you have planning and refinement sessions these questions should be answered there. By the time any dev comes to work on a ticket it shouldn't have any questions, the required approach should be documented.This isn't always going to work, but going into work without the unknowns being covered is always going to lead to productivity loss.Become the person who asks questions about every ticket and documents the answers. Your colleagues will thank you for this when they end up picking up the tickets.",

I will say usually when it's looking bad now, it's safe to assume to say it would look better in 3 years and the best time to get into something is when everyone is avoiding it. I get the fear of AI, but the way i see it AI will either replace jobs or can make more jobs. Like if a a team of 10 can complete 30 tasks (3 each) in a month without a AI. But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.Now if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE. I knew many kids who dropped out of CS and CE because they couldnt handle the coidng classes. Coding was much harder than they expected. In my school IT was seen as the CS dropout degree because IT had a low application rate, but a high transfer rate. Like IT courses would be empty fall of freshman year but by spring of freshman or fall of sopohemore year, the classes would be packed.",

At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.If they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.I joined another startup \\~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things \"in the trenches\" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.In my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!If you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity. It will be a hustle, odds are much more than 50/50 that you'll end up working your ass off for something that fails, but you'll learn a ton along the way and make some good connections. The people you meet at startups are, disproportionately, the kind of professional connection that'll be really valuable to you in 5-10 years as well.",

I have the benefit of solid connections at 2-3 companies that I can get referrals to, but little luck so far. The main difference from you is I feel like I embellish my resume more whereas you're being a little hard on yourself about not having metrics. For me, the moment it gets to a call my lack of social skills/not being able to articulate my experience becomes apparent, and I lessen my chances to go further.This is still a learning experience for me and I feel like the longer I'm in it the more I understand the game and can implement new strategies or approaches, and that unfortunately probably includes having to stretch my experience as much as I can and literally just improving my social skills through mock-exercises or going to local career fairs.But, I'm just as blind as you are, so I'd love more conversation around the topic.",

I just decided screw it I’ll close the gap using one of the jobs that’s already on my resume.And for the next interview? I got questioned about my current work gap and was told the job market was booming. This time though, I remember that you can’t argue with idiots, and I made it to the next round.Take it from someone older than you still stuck at entry level. Honesty and hard work isn’t the way to win the game. My family told me this years ago, and I didn’t listen because I was ignorant.",

It’s one of the easiest entry points into tech because it builds directly on what you already know with organizing data, spotting trends, and presenting insights. You can start by learning tools like Excel (advanced level), SQL, and Power BI or Tableau. Once you’re comfortable, you can move to Python and basic statistics. Yes, data analysis includes some stats, but you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand basic ideas like averages, percentages, and trends.For courses, check out Google Data Analytics on Coursera, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, or freeCodeCamp’s Python and SQL tutorials. They're beginner friendly and look great on a resume. As you learn, build small projects like maybe analyze public datasets or create dashboards so you have something to show employers.",

For banks and insurance companies, look up their local branches or regional offices and find the IT managers on LinkedIn - they're usually more responsive than corporate recruiters. Credit unions are actually goldmines for this stuff, way less bureaucratic than big banks and they're always looking for people who can modernize their systems. Manufacturing companies are another sleeper hit, especially if you can stomach learning some legacy systems - places like John Deere, Caterpillar, even local manufacturing firms need people who can bridge the gap between old school operations and modern tech. The key is positioning yourself as someone who can work with existing infrastructure rather than someone who wants to tear it all down and rebuild it. Also don't sleep on government contractors - they move slow but once you're in the ecosystem it's pretty stable. For getting past the portals, try reaching out to people with titles like \"IT Manager\" or \"Systems Administrator\" at these companies, they're usually buried in work and would love to have someone competent join their team. The certification thing depends on what you want to do but honestly your startup experience is probably more valuable than any cert, you just need to frame it right.",

Post-seed funding rounds would lend the startup more legitimacy.6 months isn't much for job security, and startups are pretty much antonymous to the concept of job security in the first place.The other normal consideration for startups is track record. If he's never done one before, chances are it will crash and burn. Another is pigeonholing: corporate people tend to stick w/ corporate jobs and startup people tend to stick with the startup space.

Entering into business partnership is like a marriage, and there is a non-trivial chance that the friendship will end if things with the company go sideways (which they likely will given startup failure rates) 2. Do you care about the equity? Usually if you get 200k+ in base salary, you’re not going to get the kind of equity you would if you started for minimum wage and lived off ramen for a year. Even in the best case exit, the equity may not be life-changing unless your friend is naive enough to give you both generous salary and generous equity 3. Are you willing to devote your entire life to this project for at least a year? Six months isn’t enough to get anything done, and being a founding engineer is all-consuming. I did it as a young man, but after I got married, I started turning down early-stage startup roles because I can’t afford to make work my entire life If you’re ok with the downsides that come with all of these questions, then yeah, take a risk and do it!",

Most companies out there hire SWE's. People working at those companies, even if they aren't SWE's, can refer you to a SWE position.Referrals aren't insta-job tickets. That's why they still give you technical interviews. Referrals are *character references*. It's somebody the company already likes, saying another person isn't crazy and will be a good fit for the company. That's a *huge* benefit for the company over hiring a rando off the street.",

And better social skills = better interview skills + better soft skills if you want to look at it soley in professional terms. I'm somewhat lucky, I got into tech because of my friends in school, so I've got them, when you meet new people its only natural to ask \"so what do you do for work?\" and given how big the tech industry is, you just make these contacts by talking to people. You keep in contact with coworkers even after you leave positions.",

For example, let's say you will build an Amazon clone. Some basic functions will be the front page, inventory page, how you do filtering, sorting, etc. How do you build login page for users, authentication, etc.With the help of AI I think you can do that under an hour, but here's the thing: You have to understand what's your code is doing, because people will drill you about that in your interview. Now you can do all of that through a public repo, where you can create pull requests, write tests, setup CI to run tests if possible, and deploy them to a public site where others can see it.I guarantee if you can do that, the chance of getting an interview is significantly higher",

They're awesome for building quick and clean AI interfaces without worrying too much about layout or styling. You can also use React with a UI kit (like Material UI or Tailwind) and it will save you hours because you can just drop in prebuilt components instead of coding everything from scratch. And separate your AI logic, backend API, and frontend so they’re not tangled up. So you can update or fix one part without breaking the others. Of course version control and automation help a lot so use Git branches and maybe some simple CI/CD setup to make testing and deploying easier.",
