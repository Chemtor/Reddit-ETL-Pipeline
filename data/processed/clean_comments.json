It sounds like it may have been set up poorly, and synapse set up poorly is a special kind of nightmare to deal with",

Most companies are like rickety old buildings that still have an outhouse for a toilet.They need a plumber who can put in fresh water and good drainage and a new filtration system.Suddenly there’s no grime that certain pipe has a pressure valve that you can monitor in case it blows.Suddenly the health of the company is better because the key metrics they need are also better.I think of data engineering as sort of plumbing for the business. It’s not a scam it’s just most companies are not doing stuff that is super innovative in terms of data or IT. Unless you’re working for the big tech giants that is true for many places.",

So if your company uses AWS and you need a data warehouse, it's likely that leadership just chooses redshift, despite the fact it shouldn't really be used in most cases. Check out this [white paper](https://www.redshift-observatory.ch/white_papers/downloads/introduction_to_the_fundamentals_of_amazon_redshift.html) for more info. And you can dig deeper into the dozen other white papers there if you are not convinced. >I am of the view about 95% of clients using Redshift should not be, and should be on a different database, and the reason they get away with using Redshift is because they do not in fact have Big Data.",

        "body": "I spent a couple of years with redshift and I would pick literally anything else. Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.One of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.It doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.When it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.It’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.It’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.Redshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.It’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",

The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.A huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. On the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.Personally I haven't seen any \"random errors\" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.After a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.Good engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.I know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.The biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

Your goal is to catch changes early. 3. SaaS APIs and finance sheets will always change so treat them like untrusted user input. Assume they WILL break. 4. Build joins in a downstream layer ONLY after validation and cleansing. Default to left joins with null safe logic and then log any unmatched rows. 5. Version everything using a version control system (like most common one git). Save schema versions, your data samples, and row counts with every load. It makes it 10x easier to debug what changed and when, and you can always roll back into a version in case anything goes wrong. 6. Don't spelunk through logs, you should be able to track lineage, stats, and failures in tools like OpenLineage and your future self will thank u. 7.

They will tend to do validations of type and field for you pre-transformation, have a schema mapper UI, use metadata to drive everything, load it to a destination.3) build a basic ETL tool or use some third party software to glue and piece together one. This can be a lot of work. And also ugly in its own right when building an ecosystem around a third party.Sometimes what you are dealing with is just the name of the game. Organizing workflow for all your processes will make the biggest difference. A real basic breakdown of what I like to see:1) Store the raw data, either unstructured or semi-structured, or both. (If semi structured, some of the parsing step should be broken out to accommodate first)2) Parse the data with a schema/layout (if not meta data driven, just write some sql or code. Depends on how much time you have on your hands and if you expect to support many dozens, if not hundreds of layouts. Or just 7. In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout. (Layout-specific validations — discovering inconsistencies from customer-specific problems4) transform data (and/or structure) using a schema mapping. 5) Store the sanitized data in a staging area.6)Validate data in staging area (validations on sanitized data)7)Send valid staging data to prod.Such system still has limitations as I laid out above, but if you only need to consolidate behavior, you need to build a workflow that will validate data from source, transform the input to a common output to be loaded from, then validate data at this staging area to validate for the destination (prod).",

Remember, there is no such thing as \"batch data\" only \"batch processes\". Almost any data engineering workload can be done in a manner that data is always fresh and available the moment new data is generated from source. Going more in-depth with the kinds of architectures Kafka is good for is a good step in that direction. Getting more familiar with kafka itself will help you identify more places you may be able to benefit it from it in a virtuous cycle.",

Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.At well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.It is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day). So companies will prefer to hire MLEs from the pool of people with prior MLE experience, of which there is no shortage of such people on the job market looking for a role, than DEs for MLE roles.",

Eg an mle may need to bring in data for a poc the de group doesn’t have in house yet. One of the two may bring it into a dev env but when the model needs to be moved into production the de team usually take over that new data source integration and the mle works on deploying the model.

Which means that your code has to pass every single linter check or you have to turn them off with comments in the code.This isn't too bad for new projects that can start with the linter, and if you generally agree with the linter. But for old projects being migrated it's a very time-consuming transition.A score-based linter (like pylint) instead simply gives you a score. And it's up to you, and your automation to determine what the minimum score needs to be to merge into prod. When I had to migrate a 110,000 lines of dbt that was (of course) a nightmare, we set up a process that would automatically reject any PRs using a number of rules. Basically, the worse your code was the more you had to improve it. The PR was appended with linter failure info, and the developer had a lot of flexibility - the decisions were made at the PR level, not the file level, so the developer could have a nasty file that was hard to fix and so decided to make improvements to other files instead. We didn't care.This process allowed us to force the codebase clean up to have gradually, so it didn't cause much hardship. Just had to be patient and wait.",

For example, last year, there was a good 3 months where data streaming from GA4 just straight up lost 30%+ of your data. They'll still take your money though. I work in mobile gaming, unfortunately going full Google stack is the pragmatic choice. They take 30%+ of your revenue on the store, admob takes an indisclosed % of ad inventory and for marketing ads your also having to trust their pricing algorithms - oh and pay for search ads, which is a straight up mafia style extortion :P Add to that the tooling, we are going Google in the order of millions- 10s millions a year. For that wonderful cost, you get broken products and some incredibly sub-par support - as a company they are so segmented that none of their business facing staff actually know anything with any practical depth. The only way they could be worse was if they were ironsource or Apple.AWS on the other hand are a dream.I'm starting to think the migration to cloud was a mistake. The idea 20 odd years ago was less code to manage and simple environments to deploy, with more reliable backend. Most cloud suites are a bloated mess, with skill and time requirements slowly creeping up to just having a dedicated backend team. Also, the nature of being a black box with slow response to business issue, they are becoming unreliable at scale.Granted, when it all works my life is a dream. After my postgrad being deep in ancient LAMP stacks and Fortran77 - moving to a pure GCP/python environment was bliss. Also BigQuery is pretty god damn fantastic.",

        "body": "I was a DE in RL during 2024 and left in Jan this year, so just giving my 2 cents here.Obviously, if you don't currently have a job, the answer is yes, especially in the current market. Not much to talk about there, so I'm going to assume that you do have a job that you are hesitant on leaving because of stability concerns in RL.IMO, there are three main factors for you to consider about stability. The first is the stability in the role itself. This depends almost entirely on what org the role is hiring for. Roles supporting, say, the RL games catalog/shop might not be as stable as roles supporting login or service stability. Even the most recent round of layoffs within RL only affected those within Oculus Studios (at least, as far as we know).The second is the overall trend of RL. Lots of people online seem to have a negative view on RL's trajectory since it's been a massive money-sink for Meta, but I personally would be surprised to see real mass layoffs across RL anytime soon.The third is the stability of Meta as a whole. From what I can tell, people within Meta feel very insecure about their jobs, especially after the Feb layoffs this year. I got to witness both the Nov 2022 and this years layoffs, and from what I can tell, moral is at an all-time low right now, even compared to Nov 2022, which was almost 3x as big a layoff. Several of my coworkers across multiple teams were already on the verge of burnout before Feb, but now, people are worried about this year's layoffs happening every year. Even though everyone that I worked with at Meta seemed like genuinely good people, many voiced concerns about others stealing their work, overtaking their scope, and whatever else they need to do to get great yearly rating, because apparently even just a good yearly rating isn't good enough to secure your position, and every year, the bar raises. Given the current market and that people's livelihoods are at stake, it's definitely a reasonable concern.Without more context about your current situation, like your current TC, financial responsibilities, or personal and/or professional priorities, I can't confidently give any solid pointers, but despite all of the doom I just posted, if given the opportunity, I would advise most people in most situations to take the job. Meta rewards you very handsomely for the shit they put you through and are not afraid to promote you in just 1-2 years if you can perform. I've heard of senior engineers breaking 7 figures because of stock bonuses and the stock's performance in the market. That kind of compensation is usually reserved for staff+, and if you can achieve even just half of that for one year, the amount you earn can be life-changing. Also, as others have mentioned, having Meta on your resume is incredibly valuable.If I were you, I'd definitely at least try to get an offer. In the meantime, you can weigh the different factors in your life that you care about. You won't even have to actually make a decision until you get an offer, and even if you decide to not accept the offer, you can at least try to leverage that offer at your current job for a raise.Good luck!",

That snapshot then had transforms to cut down the data as needed into other snapshots. Want something that only targets a specific geographical area, or a particular customer segment, or product, or a random sample? Then just grab a data snapshot for that and restore it into your project.Just check the costs against your labour costs though. If it is only costing 10% of an FTE, then is it even worth messing around with it? With that cost if it would take more than 10% of someone's time in a year to set this up and maintain it, then it isn't worth changing. If your dev is costing 100% of an FTE to run on prod data rather than a cut-down version, then it is probably worth having someone spend their time on setting up that cut-down data.",

Also it would require for you to go back and change previously written partitions as time goes on.The functionality more so exists so say you have a massive table where you want to “evolve” the schema and/or partition over time, you don’t have to rewrite the whole table.What you are proposing could work, but I am guessing you would be incurring some performance hits because now your query execution engine has to factor in multiple partition patterns. Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.Edit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",

Kafka Connect Worker Configuration:(1) Ensure you’re using Kafka Connect in distributed mode.(2) Set the following property in your worker configuration: `exactly.once.source.support=enabled`2. Debezium Connector Configuration:(1) In your Debezium connector configuration, add: `\"exactly.once.support\": \"required\"1D (2) Use \"required\" to enforce that the connector supports exactly-once semantics.(3) Alternatively, \"requested\" can be used to attempt exactly-once delivery without strict enforcement.3. Transaction Boundary (Optional):(1) Define how Kafka Connect groups records into transactions using the transaction.boundary setting:(2) \"poll\" (default): Groups all records fetched in a single poll into one transaction.(3) \"interval\": Groups records based on a time interval specified by transaction.boundary.interval.ms.(4) \"connector\": Delegates transaction boundaries to the connector itself.But I think the big grain of salt here is that during snapshots this guarantee can completely fall over.",

Parenting takes far more out of your body than you think it does.

It probably means things will move slow and the data quality is awful. But, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It means the business is going to be very reliant on you as an individual to add value whereas your current employer knows exactly what they need out of your role more than you as a person. That equates to higher ownership and getting more business forward with your soft skills. If the two are the only option, as an expected parent, I would leave for the Healthcare job. However, I would be very frank with your current employer that you want to work there long term and if the role opens up for FTE, you will come back. Keep your doors open. If that shuts the door, they were giving you lip service the entire time. When my current job loses good people, they tend to hire them back 2-3 years later at an elevated role.",

It was difficult and a lot of the things that come out of the box in Databricks or Snowflake took time and energy to get right. I assume it is similar in Fabric, but I also think they have fixed some of the shortcomings (although added others from what I understand). I will say this, after we got everything set up it worked well and operated like most modern data stacks. We transformed all of our data using dbt-core and landed our data using data load tool (dlt) on our data lake using git self-hosted runners kicked off using synapse pipelines, data was not huge and all of the complexity was in the dbt project. We rarely were \"in\" synapse after everything started to run smoothly. I would never pick Synapse or Fabric if I was going to make the decision for a new environment. However, if it is a greenfield project and you can help architect the solution and add solid governance/naming conventions I would say it is beneficial experience. You can transfer those skills to any other platform. If it is already up and running without any ability to help build the solution I might be worried about being pigeonholed into Fabric. It is a tough decision in the end. Congratulations on being a parent! It is a lot of work and something else you need to consider. Stability would be important to me as well.",

        "body": "Adding this to echo some other answers with my experience: I worked for a healthcare company a few years ago. They also tended to go with every new Microsoft product and had 0 idea of how to implement it. The non-technical directors/vp's/c-suite people would generally get sold on a product, then everyone else would follow suit or risk future promotions at best or being fired at worst. IMHO it created an environment where the politics of a given tech stack started to outweigh it's technical importance. There were tons of inter-departmental clashes between those who adopted new tech and those who held on to legacy tooling/processes. I felt the only people who stayed at that job were either ruthless ladder climbers or coasters who valued job stability over anything else. Definitely a \"our department vs. theirs\" mindset. There were exceptions but that was the general rule.You'll find that at any job, but in healthcare (I've worked in a variety of sectors) I found this to be the most prominent and the fact that the full time role is healthcare and they use Fabric makes me think you'll run into the same things. I've not used Fabric and have no idea of it's quality outside of things I've heard second hand, but I would look at it more as a signal of what the company will be like then purely a technical issue as you presented.",

I really appreciate the perspective, especially from someone who’s been through the parenting transition recently.You make a great point about the healthcare org likely needing a lot of foundational work and how that could translate to higher ownership and influence. It’s definitely a tradeoff between technical satisfaction and making a broader impact (while also getting some much-needed stability). It’s something I haven’t fully thought through yet as I enjoy the day-to-day of coding to solve problems. Also, really solid advice about being transparent with my current employer and keeping the door open. If they’re genuinely invested in me, that conversation will clarify a lot.

To be transparent, I’m the primary source of financial support for me and my wife currently. Additionally, any financial support from my family will be limited to say the least. So stability and benefits are weighing heavily in my decision. It’s not an easy call, but I’m trying to balance long-term growth with near-term security.Your question about whether working with less exciting tools is worth the peace of mind is something I’m still working through. With that in mind, what enterprise tools are you using day to day, and what kinds of frustrations are you running into with them? Always helpful to hear how others are navigating similar challenges.",

Dagster's deployments allow multi-tenancy under one umbrella. We even have customers using Dagster with Airlift to bring multiple Airflow instances into a single Dagster deployment so they can see it all in one place. Outside of orchestration, Dagster has a data catalog, data quality, cost insights, and we've just started shipping Dagster Components which lets you create templatized pipelines for your stakeholders. Imagine a less technical team wanting to only write YAML while your core platform team wants to write Python, you can do that now.I will say a lot of the benefits of Dagster will come in a hosted version. The hybrid model lets you execute all the code in your infra, but if you care about things like real-time insights you'll want Dagster+. You can do it all yourself on your own infra if you have the expertise and resources though.",

I think decisions like this exist on a spectrum, for the sake of your question.If the ML prediction outputs are something that is very \"closely\" tied to the document records, then re-funneling things through the raw layer so that it all flows downstream, could make a lot of sense. A trivial example, would be like a \"word count\"... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a \"word count\" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.If the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. But there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a \"pure\" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well.

To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. Our ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'. All data flows through this generic model and then flows to the various reporting layers that need it. This also provides standard building blocks for document chunking/RAG which we have built on top of this. Not sure on exactly what you mean by pushing the derived data breaks the idea of it being raw data? The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse. It's a totally new source of data, hence it should be treated as such and move through the raw layer.",

The outputs are mostly used for reporting right now and even in the case of a recommender system, ML outputs would just be stored on a feature store and repurposed for the system or other models. A first question would be, what do you mean with an ML output being closely tied to the record and how do you measure it? In a sense, all ML predictions based on articles used for reporting a related to the article itself, but how that requires funneling them again to the raw layer I don’t get yet. Another question would be tracking lineage, output versioning and handling re-edited articles. The team uses dbt for ETL and lineage tracking, I don’t know if this would influence what integration to use. Moreover, if we were to track prediction versions, this could be handled in a feature store. But the real challenge is handling re-edited articles that must be repredicted and what integration would facilitate triggering repredictions and updates into our DWH.So far the options have been funneling to raw layer or an independent architecture sourcing from the analytics core, processing predictions in an independents architecture, and the piping predictions back into the later reporting layer. Only draw back is looking the dbt-integrated lineaging creating a kinda black box effect. But then again, this could be tracked from the ML side. What do you think?",

It is a downstream system that generates new data that needs to be ingested.The days going to ML might change in some incompatible way, so this allows the ML output layer to account for that, rather than breaking things at the integration point. If the data from the ML changes then that forces to raw, and it goes through a usual process of standing a schema change or a new source.Another way to think of it is that a dwh processes *never* goes backwards through the layers. That makes it extraordinarily difficult to pick where to put the ML inputs and outputs as the most sensible place to integrate the data into other models could be anywhere, or in multiple places, or it might move. Therefore you treat it as external, you send it says from some output layer, and you interest into your raw layer.",

        "body": "Thank you for your insight, I think you just clarified the concept of raw data and how ML outputs could be considered as simple another source of raw (aka new) data. In our case, we have data from different products going into the raw layer, later processed and aggregated into fact tables. Your suggestion is that ML models would be based on the aggregated data in later layers, be processed in an independents architecture outside the DWH, and then piped into the DWH as an additional source of raw data. Correct?Since predictions of this type would be tied to a uuid (here an article id), I’m guessing it wouldn’t matter if the ML predictions table have the schema of the aggregated tables (i.e. not a product wise schema, where each product comes in as a separate source), because the predictions table could be rejoined by uuid in the aggregated tables or even earlier, while still passing through the whole generic model. Right?One worry was that the architecture would look cyclical, have a layer be both the source and output for ML predictions. Not sure if this would be the case or a problem but I also wanted to ask you about this",

The most trivial way when you just give SQL DB schema and ask for complex SQL that should give nice result for data visualization - this really can work with an inappropriate accuracy. This task might need highly refined prompt with many instructions (and RAG) + good (large) thinking model that can give correct results.At the same time, results may be much better if context is not SQL database but data model inside BI tool and output is not SQL but rather simple report configuration (JSON), generating this kind of structured output is much easier task for LLM (even small models you can self-host with ollama!) which doesn't require thinking, in fact users can get a relevant report in seconds.From BI end-users perspective, another useful application of LLM can be assistance with report's analysis: imagine that user opens a report, and simply chooses from menu \"Get Insights\", \"Find Anomalies\", \"Analyze trends\", \"Generate summary\" and this report's data context is passed to LLM with an appropriate fine-tuned prompt. This kind of unobtrusive AI-assistance can be especially useful for users that don't have any data analysis skills.This is how AI can be really helpful from BI tool perspective - in fact we're implementing these things in our product. I have another ideas too which are more complex to implement - like \"chat with data\" (so user can ask & get exact answers, not just reports, using all reports/data models available in the BI tool).",

        "body": "You'll want to study topics like distributed systems, data warehousing, ETL processes, and big data technologies. Common questions might involve designing a data pipeline for a specific use case, like a real-time analytics system or a recommendation engine. Interviewers often ask you to walk through your thought process, discussing trade-offs and explaining your choices.To prepare, I'd recommend studying popular architectures like Lambda and Kappa, familiarizing yourself with cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), and understanding concepts like data partitioning, replication, and consistency. Practice drawing system diagrams and explaining your design decisions. Real-world experience is invaluable, so reflect on your past projects and be ready to discuss challenges you've faced and how you've solved them. If you're looking for extra practice with tricky interview questions, use [interview helper AI](http://interviews.chat) to prepare. Full disclosure, I'm on the team that made it, but it's a useful tool for navigating system design scenarios.",

Do a sufficient amount of this for a year, and you now have a year of experience for ah actual company rather than some random projects that probably won't stand out. You could even pull back the start date to a year earlier (giving you 2 years of 'experience' ) and just claim that you didn't incorporate the company officially until a year later if asked (they may not even check, so long as the linkedin founding date is the same).This is all very much on the edge, and I am sure some people will clutch their pearls at this, claiming it is unethical, but it will probably be way more fun and give you a way more competitive edge on the job market. This is how you beat the catch-22 of needing experience just out of uni (until India or TikTok catches wind of this and it becomes unviable). You have got to be crafty if you wanna succeed in this job market. It's just like a video game.NOTE - For what it's worth, the 'meta' for applying seems to be tailoring your CV to each job post using AI (well) and the same with cover letters (well). If you do all of this, I would be surprised if you can't get a job.",

A systematic governance framework is required in every business that assigns clear data accountability to each data role. DEs and DAs need to collaborate and answer one fundamental question first: What data product does the business need?To achieve such a goal, DEs and DAs need structured and adaptable data quality rules and to determine how to monitor and catch issues at the source. This is the critical overlap that many organizations are missing today.If you can, build a custom (homebrew) system to detect data issues early. If that's not feasible or scalable, invest in a data observability platform that meets these needs.I might have answered a bit more than you asked for, but this is a good question and I think it's worth rethinking, even for some senior DEs and DAs.",

These tables usually have all attributes in a json object- raw table: using DBT, I define a raw table per source table, for the purpose of inserting every change per primary key, while keeping the table attributes in that json object column for now. I add metadata columns like load time and table key+current time+attributes to give a sort of historical key that's unique over time. The insert only approach compares the last state in the dw vs the incoming state to check for any difference, and to capture deletes.- flattened view: using DBT, I copy the metadata from the raw table, then expand out the attributes object into columns.- curated view: basically select star of the above, but with descriptions, added privacy tags (for tag-based masking), etc. this is what analysts see.Why I use this approach:- it's dead simple to maintain because even if the source attributes change, the raw layer still bundles them into the object column- new columns getting captured can just be added at any time from the view, ie object:new_column- keeping the full history is auditable and allows analysts to see what they \"knew\" at a given point in time, which can be very valuable in some circumstances, e.g. seeing how long it took for user status to change.The above is a rough description so lmk if you need me to elaborate",

Consider exploring [PyArrow](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/) with the Azure Storage SDK, this allows you to create Delta tables locally and then upload them, avoiding mounting storage in containerized Dagster environments.",

Most business do not hire for someone that specialises.

        "body": "Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.Even companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!DataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible \"thing\" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:DataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.But there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.So, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract. In other case, have a good plan B. Whatever happens, good luck!",

Configure the pipeline with filtering parameters to support both full and incremental loads based on your requirements. For incremental patterns, either implement change tracking on your source if possible or add last\\_modified timestamps and use ADF's watermark functionality to track loaded records.If your environment includes analytics data sources, Windsor.ai offers specialized connectors that could simplify part of your ingestion requirements. Their platform can handle the complexities of data extraction and deliver it directly to your Azure SQL target.Consider implementing a medallion architecture in your dbt project, where bronze tables are 1:1 copies from your source, silver tables handle cleaning and transformations, and gold tables serve business needs. This approach separates your transformation logic from the replication process and improves maintainability. For Azure SQL optimization, implement proper indexing, partition larger tables, and use OPTION (RECOMPILE) hints where appropriate to ensure your dbt transformations perform well even without columnar storage.",

You could use the Great Expectation Python package or maybe even just import things into a Pandas dataframe and select the rows where the rules fail. The AIs can probably give you a decent template for how this code should look. 3. Export the failures to a new CSV. I think it'd be easiest to just drop it in another S3 bucket and retrieve it. But with a little configuring you could get it emailed somewhere. 4. Set the Lambda function to be triggered when files are added to the S3 Bucket. There's a couple of wildcards in there still. I think your job should be small enough that it can just be an AWS Lambda function. I forget the timeout but I think those can run for 20-30 minutes which should be plenty to do your roughly 30k checks. Without knowing more, I'm not sure of an elegant way to maintain the logic of the rules other than just typing them in as code. ...which is a bummer.",

This POC will focus on pyspark jobs running on databricks with EMR and K8s being on the roadmap if the POC is successful. Very high level but the idea is for it to1. Analyze existing pipeline jobs/workflows-Review current notebook code, spark configurations and previous job run metrics.2. Replicate pipeline into its own environment-This will copy the existing project repo into its own and deploy a copy of the job/resources and table structures.3. Benchmarking-Run its replicated job, using the same table structures but fabricated data. It will capture metrics and iterate through changes to the code/spark configurations while logging results.4. Recommend changes based on benchmarks-Document suggested changes that will improve job performance based on the benchmarking done.",

It's a short read with some diagrams available -though I recently listened to the audiobook and didn't feel the missing reference images took away from the experience. The author basically starts mentioning the abacus and other early calculating machines, which leads to Babbage/Lovelace, which leads to Turing, which leads to Von Neumann, which leads to... etc etc all the way up to modern networking, cloud, and social media. It doesn't go overly in-depth into any one topic, but still explains a lot of things in a way that's easy enough to grok even without a CS background. And it's not just historical figures like a textbook, he does explain things like how vacuum tubes worked and *why* certain things developed the way they do, like how CS concepts we consider foundational today were being theorized/implemented to invent devices to accurately. Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term \"digital\", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day. Definitely recommend, especially if you like history or are a little shaky on certain CS topics. Really having a good explanation of how a vacuum tube actually works before moving onto microprocessors really helped the IRL \"tech tree\" make so much more sense to me, and now if you ask me what a microprocessor is, I won't any longer respond by saying \"idk, shit that low level is just magic to me\"",

If you don’t enjoy programming or coding (which it sounds like you may not) it’s prob best not to force it. Let things happen naturally do what interests you. If you’re not afraid of taking on some debt (which shouldn’t be too much if you go the trade school route) I think becoming an electrician could deff pay off. Don’t give up hope remember the good times and your more than just your career. Remember also. Small habits make big changes. Try doing just 15 min of something you want to learn every day and see what happens. I hope the best for you friend",

Generally speaking, developing programming languages and techniques is a matter of allowing humans to express, in the ways that they think, a bunch of instructions than can be converted to the way the machine 'thinks'. Humans think in objects. There is a thing called a car. I have one. Mine is a particular colour and it can drive to places at various speeds... yada yada yada. OOP let's us express these ideas in these ways. When it comes to large, complex systems, this kind of separation and encapsulation can help tame the chaos. Over the years, I have come to accept that forcing \\*everything\\* into the object model is a mistake (as a Java guy for a couple of decades, this was a hard lesson to learn), but there are times when it is the right way to express an idea, even a very complex one.

        "body": "Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.Yet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.For me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.Think about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.Exactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.When you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.Even better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.Sure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.Reuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always \"communicates\"/\"interacts\" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",

An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can \"communicate\" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.The example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.But imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.That is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are \"communicating\" than running a procedure.Since many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is \"easy\" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program. Smaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",

        "body": "The benefits wont show up much on small single person projects over a short timespan.The essence of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.The point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.One place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.The other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.I’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting.",

        "body": "To your credit most intro programming courses do a horrible job of explaining the purpose of object oriented programming. They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.First, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.Procedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.However, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.In reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",

Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.As a learning pattern it is something that really seems to \"click\" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things \"really exist\" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.You can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time \"Enemy\" should be a \"Unit\", but other times it should be a \"Targetable\" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.With practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.I think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",

Management tells you to add a feature so buyers can be enticed to buy a new version, and the more you look at what has to change to make the feature work, the more impossible it seems.Object-oriented code is a way to manage complexity, and make it possible to add to the code without having to understand all of it.

        "body": "Object oriented programming failed to deliver on most of its promises in practice. So much so that use of many features, like deep inheritance trees, is heavily discouraged. These days functional programming is what is in vogue, though that too leads to some rather tortured codes in places. Traditionally Object oriented languages have acquired features to support it. Note that a lot of the new up and coming languages like Go and Rust only include a subset of Object oriented features.Java is an excellent example of this. Version 1.0 was a small neat and Object oriented language, and over time it has acquired a whole lot of syntax that makes it look like a Functional language. And Java derivatives like Kotlin that this even further.",

Let's say that sport is football, what you learn in your first football match will far surpass anything you studied about the general skills?

        "body": "Amidst all these optimistic comments, I’m going to shatter some dreams. It is only my opinion but here we go.Employers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well. The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.An example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.This is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.In reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.In my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).Of course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective. There is no right answer as to at which stage of that exactly, one will be able to land a job. However, learning about all of these concepts to a decent extent is the fastest way to land a good job in the field.",

However you've probably already done this in school, even without knowing! (Learn other principles depending on the role, front end roles might require some specific front end framework knowledge for example)Most job interviews required a technical round where they want you to create a simple app, like a small CRUD app. Dont overcomplicate it, use local/ram storage and a framework you know well enough to do this in. I'd say most jobs will just use a coding platform like leetcode for some simple problems though!You don't have to know everything off by heart, the first couple months at your job you'll learn a lot of things. Feel free to feel \"dumb\" or imposter syndrome. Just ask a lot of questions when you start, even if they're basic. Even 3 years in I ask some basic questions about new things I'm learning!It might seem daunting but with the skills you've listed I think you're better off than many other people.

Code compilation, particularly for C++ is a computationally intensive task. Even with just the basic libraries and a couple of headers.I ran the preprocessor (clang++ -E) to check how many header files the compile opened and parsed as part of the compilation of the code above (which has only two #include directives); it processed 1,420 header files. Both of the header files I included referenced others, that referenced still others, and so on. Ultimately, the compiler is doing A LOT during the compilation stage even on trivially simple code.

Some of those choices, like requiring all variable declarations to be at the top of the function, have been fixed, but quite a few oddities remain.Also, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and C# all adopted a fairly similar basic style. Their function declarations, for instance, can look quite similar. But that doesn't mean that the style is \"simpler;\" other languages just choose different conventions. They're languages, after all. Different languages make different choices. Go's not really much more complicated than C; it's just that its functions look a little different. You get used to it pretty quickly, and then it's just as readable. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Go's style decisions, but I wouldn't call it \"complicated\" in comparison to something like JavaScript.",

I don't know how to put it into words. But they definitely see it as a skill to become better and more proficient in.I see it as a means to an end for artistic expression.

I just do what's fun. I enjoy the simplicity of SQL ( I was better at it than my director only a few months in haha), I enjoy the chaotic free-for-all that JavaScript is, and I enjoy the approachability of C#.But most of all, I enjoy seeing things just work. I get so excited seeing technology able to make things function. Watching code full from a database and vice versa for the first time made me so excited.If you want to enjoy programming, just find what makes you happy, don't try and be \"The next best thing\", or be like everyone else. Otherwise, just see it as a tool to make you a lot of money, or more efficient.Regardless, figure out what exactly you want to do with these skills, and it will quickly become a lot easier to approach.",

So, an important part of this activity is finding interesting problems and solving them. The satisfaction obtained when our solution works (and we or the user found it useful) is like a painter or sculptor feels seeing her/his last finished opus.Keep learning; search about the evolution of programming, languages, paradigms, models, etc., be amazed about the persistence of people using wood and rocks to build smart buildings and smarter bridges between them. Do you know there are languages that can do calculations and solve any problem using only colors, strange symbols, or where the code is so that you can sing it with a guitar?

I felt incompetent and struggling on every step of every project really ate away at the enthusiasm i had for the work. I was also decent at my previous role and that made it harder to struggle so much. I also felt it was a big mistake. I’m a couple of years out from that state and i’m feeling much better at a new company. I’d say assess where your emotions are coming from and if you truly no longer work as a dev. I’d wager you still do and you just don’t like your current environment. I think you will achieve the satisfaction you desire if you keep at it, stop being pointlessly hard on yourself (make it constructive!), and maybe find a workplace that helps you grow. Good luck.",

Short commands that we use all the time we know. Long commands that we use repeatedly get written into scripts and put in version control, like any other code. Long commands that we use once likely require consulting a reference and iterating a few attempts, same as programming in general.Code organization is a separate topic. Experience on larger projects helps. Some frameworks nail it down for you and have strong conventions around where things go. Often we're working in a legacy codebase, and we use the organization that's already there, or we might rework it to make it better organized. There are methodologies for how to organize a codebase and some work better than others. Use of packages and modules are widespread for larger projects, but single-file apps exist. Layers are overrated. Verticals are better. Functional core, imperative shell. Try to avoid dependency cycles among modules. Some codebases have a single main that everything flows into, while others have multiple entry points. Culture varies with ecosystem. Python thinks flat is better than nested, but Java likes to nest a lot more.",

The key is the column of a database, and the value is the value of the row from a database. This is a bit of simplification just to be clear but I still think it captures the essence of what JSON is used for/structure/etc.",

For example they enable you to POST data to databases in single calls or in bulk, form webhooks to execute an API call with a method (e.g., POST, GET, POST_JSON, etc.) to a specific endpoint based on a trigger, specify configurations on an application (e.g., single API call to enable/disable setting, specifying version and dependencies in a webpage hosting application, etc.), and so much more.The syntax in my opinion is really straightforward. Data is contained in curly brackets, structured in key/value pairs, separated by commas, and evaluates to JavaScript objects.",

But I know there are lots and lots of job descriptions that are like \"must have 4+ years experience using \" so I understand why people want to predict these things and start as soon as possible with a specific technology. There is value there but I just feel like its value is often exaggerated when compared to the value of general programming abilities.

Computer technicians used to be a primarily female field back in the 50’s until, you guessed it, programming started to be viewed as a respectable and lucrative career. So many great female figures in computer science history that just don’t get talked about enough, (I highly recommend the movie “Hidden Figures” if you haven’t seen it before). You’ve got the inventor of COBOL and first person to write a compiler, Grace Hopper, the director of software development for the Apollo spacecraft and first person to coin the term software engineering, Margaret Hamilton, Ada Lovelace who was arguably the first programmer ever, the list goes on.I’m a high school teacher and not an industry worker so I don’t know where you should go next, but learn the history if you haven’t before. It will make you more confident, if a little bit angry, and it will give you better context for what you see in the industry today.

Lets take on C++ strings and string processing first, then. Try doing the basic stuff... make a string from a constant, append to it, find a substring, convert it to uppercase, and so on. All those common things you do regularly. Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.From there, I would master the vector class. You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector variablename format and work it from there. Work the learncpp chapter on vectors hard.NOW, with your feet a little wetter, give classes and object oriented programming chapters a look, and start working that stuff.A couple of things to forget from C for a while: pointers. Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn. If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct. This is similar but not exactly akin to something like for(int \\*ip = arrayname; ip < &arrayname\\[max\\]; ip++)",

I will share withou you what situation I found myself in to better illustrate this.I am building a dashboard that will show some data like system usage, uptime monitoring and some other things. I have a Raspberry Pi with a display set up for this and it will live on my desk so I can quickly reference it if needed.I needed to get the usage data from my PC to the Raspberry Pi and the solution I found was quite simpler than I initially expected: I made a Windows client that just sends data to an API and I configured a webserver on the Pi.I still needed some data from the Windows client to see if any relevant events occur, like loosing connection, getting an error or anything that should happen at runtime I would like to be notified about, maybe a few simple configurations. So I decided to make the application run headless, but having a tray icon. This helped me have a few settings in the tray menu, simple toggles, on and off. For the messages that communicate my client application’s state I chose to use notifications. So like this I have settings and feedback from the application without any actual UI.Of course it is more of a particular case creating a dedicated web server, but I eanted to ilustrate to you that there are some (maybe non-conventional) solutions, other than doing the interface in Python. I have also thought about implementing some logic on the webserver so it could send some data as a response that would trogger some change in the client’s behavios behavior. That would basically move the configuration from the tray menu to the thouchscreen display of the Pi. There are solutions, just think of what is best for your use-case!As for my reasoning, I think Python is more of a backend oriented language. Even though it is possible to do interfaces in Python, I think it is far from ideal.",

Even before ai, there weee always people that were magnitudes ahead of me and you in programming. I never let that slow me down. I still learnt because I wanted to gain a deeper understanding regardless of if Bob over there could do it 10x faster. Same here. Cs isn’t all programming. There’s other stuff that you do on the job that ai hasn’t been able to do yet. Why do you think OpenAI bought a vs code fork (windsurf) for $3b if their latest unreleased ai was reported to be the top 50 coder? Cuz coding isn’t everything.Stop comparing yourself to others or ai. Just learn because you’re passionate about it, same reason I learnt. And if you’re not passionate about it, I’m afraid you won’t succeed in cs. This applies to every career though, if you’re not passionate or don’t like it you won’t get very far without pushing yourself a lot.",

If you hadn't already mentioned Node.js I would have suggested looking into other languages/frameworks.But perhaps it would be a good experience to take an \"unexpected turn\" at the cross-roads you are currently on - here's some of my different suggestions for you to perhaps narrow the choice down a bit: Pick one, not more.**1. Continue on the current road**Learn other languages / frameworks for backend development: Java Spring Boot, JavaScript Express, C# w Razor/Blazor, Python w Django / Flask, or whichever combination you find. Something new but well known.**2. Go deeper in the professional development career**Learn more about the infrastructure around coding: all the DevOps branches, testing, automated testing, dev containers, docker, github actions, deployment, CI/CD and so on - become a \"software developer\" more than a programmer, and understand the environment around the software.**3. Go deeper in programming**You have some low level C++ knowledge, but do you understand data structures and algorithms, do you know how a linked list is built, or why a hashmap is as fast as it is? While these aren't necessarily required skills in this day and age, it helps to understand more about the machine, more about why programming works the way it does, and it can be very code-nerdy fun.**4. Take the alternate route**Try something completely new: * perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends* or **games programming** \\- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities* or **hardware programming** \\- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.* or **app development** \\- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.Right now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out. You will always become a better programmer than you already are, no matter which direction you pick!",

If you can't handle that delay after having typed in a command, of course you should go with the faster version ...Anyways, never believe anyone talking about how some constructs in the programming language are faster or slower than others - usually they are wrong, and perpetuate myths started by 1970s assembly-programmers. And a note to those, who think that a string comparison takes additional time - it doesn't. In all modern languages, strings are immutable and handled by the runtime, which means that comparing one string to another is as simple as comparing two addresses - it is as fast as comparing any other value!",

The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).It's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. If you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.If you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. interface Command { void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs); }Replace `SomeType` with the actual type.You would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say). You'd do something like // commandMap is a hash map Command obj = commandMap.get(commandName); obj.runCommand(commandName, lineArgs);It is a bit more complicated to get this set up, but not a whole lot more.",

Don't worry until you have a reason to worry. Why are you thinking about this now? What does the loop do? Do you have a hard time constraint you are trying to stay within? Don't optimize prematurely. That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of \"should I consider this now\" vs \"note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue\".I am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.B: You have decided to listen to random people give you \"this is how it is\" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident \"this is how it is\" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.Anyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.edit: I dropped the term \"function pointer\" in this without thinking language. Deep in my C work right now. Dispatch table/pattern is still a great idea, but ignore my usage of the term function pointer.",

This is often why you saw a new programmer on a project rewrite the code. They couldn't understand the existing code. What these programmers didn't realize is they were writing code others couldn't follow, for the same reason. We know what we meant to do in our own code. There's a lot of code out there with little documentation, so it can be a pain to figure out what the code does unless it's very clean code.Unless you write horrible code, you're always going to prefer your code over others. Maybe if you wrote spaghetti code and someone is writing super clean code, you'd prefer reading, but I'd say that's uncommon.It's a necessary task.Oh yes, sometimes working with other people's code leads a person into rewriting vast parts because they didn't like how that person coded it up. Depending on the situation, that could be considered a waste of time.I had to work on legacy code where there were Java methods 2000 lines long, where the Java class was 20,000 lines long. *One class!*. It was a bunch of copy/paste and spaghetti code. But it would have been insane to rewrite it. First of all, it was hard to tell what the program was *supposed* to do. Second, it was so large that it would have taken a long time and been challenging to test.Indeed, we often asked our customers (non-programmers) to test manually (use the web applications). They wouldn't have time to do a good test (often hastily done and incomplete) because, guess what, they had other work to do.So, we had to live with not changing the code, or changing it in minimal ways. It would have taken years to just reproduce the code in a nice way.",

Layers in the code are actually abstraction layers, go to the minimal necessary depth only. For example the code has to decode some binary and get an ID from it. It requires reading, decoding, transforming and extracting. About a dozen lines, but if the name is good and says extractSomeIDFromTheBitSausage(), then the only information you need that this method gives you the required ID.

Work to learn best practices and make sure you aren't complacent about things like continuous deployment, source control, and design practices. When you read comments about lone developers that ended up with problems, they always mentioned that they had their way of doing things, and usually they were not documented, no source control, etc.Working with other devs, I was surprised by how similar the issues a Python dev or a UI guy has run into.

I give it the plan and just have it fill in some of the details.But even then, I have to check it very carefully. It quite often gets something wrong, especially the longer the code gets. Like, it might have two functions that both look right if you look at them separately, but if you look at the program overall you realize that one is interpreting a certain parameter exactly the opposite as the other one is.* How do you *stay intentional* while working with AI tools?I often add things to my prompt like: don't give me all of the code, just discuss the approaches. Or: before coding this, think of lots of clarifying questions and keep asking me them until you're confident that the spec is unambiguous.I like to help get the AI started, I define the class names, method names, and variable names as a starting point. It's really good at taking my lead and following a similar pattern. That way things are written the way I want, and mistakes jump out more than if it's not my style.* Do you treat AI output as a first draft, or as something to deeply understand and improve?Again, if I don't fully understand it, I don't trust it. That means my homework is to research what I don't know first.When I do understand it, I often ask AI for several modifications, then take it as a draft and modify it to my own style.",

        "body": "I think most people here know at this point that AI can't do the whole job for us. It's excellent at code completion, i.e. guessing what you probably are going to write next. Anything beyond that and you have to be very skeptical with what it's giving you. It will confidently tell you exactly how to fix a problem, even if the solution isn't remotely correct. It's also an excellent rubber duck and sanity checker. Ask it small simple questions about syntax or common paradigms to refresh yourself. Always keep in mind it can be wrong, even on simple things, even when it sounds very confident, and think critically about its responses, don't trust it blindly. The thing about \"coding\" is that it's the easiest part of the job that is software development. AI can and often will write functional and efficient code for common problems, but your job as a developer is to figure out how solutions to common problems can come together to be a useful application/tool/interface. So use it to help speed you up on things you want to write, when you already know what you need to write, but don't rely on it to just magically know that right way to wire up a class to do something specific in a way that works with your application. One tip: I'm a big fan of asking AI to review the \"intent\" of my code. I'll ask it to examine a section of code and give me its impression of what it believes the developer who wrote the code was intending for it to do, and how they likely intended to use it. I do this to fact check myself, and make sure I didn't just spend a half hour writing nonsense that doesn't do anything remotely close to what I thought I wanted it to do. Again, always keep in mind it can be wrong, but use its response to figure out if an external viewer might see your code differently than how you do. It should be noted, comments and variable names can heavily skew the output sometimes. It's often not worth the effort, but I have occasionally deliberately obfuscated my code before asking it to review it, to make sure its impression isn't being colored by the hints in the naming or comments. The flip side of that is that sometimes you can ask it to identify when naming or comments are confusing in light of what the code is actually doing.",

How might you craft that line? Oh OK, that one didn't work, here's a very simple metaphor to describe what's happening.. I created a SPARQL, it didn't work out so I figured out the next steps by process of elimination.. now I have a TON of core features and am very close to a live test.AI is an assistant, not a replacement. It's an organizer, not a creator. I use it as a journal, as a thing to bounce ideas off, organize my thoughts and remind me when I've skipped a step. It's a tool, not an employee. The potential is endless, just need to know how to use the tool.. Again I'm a noob so please forgive the terminology.",

In 2020, my intro to programming was [www.codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com). I had a great experience with it and can only highly recommend it.Then I did two \"nano degrees\" from [www.udacity.com](http://www.udacity.com). They are super expensive. A very good thing, though, is they give you projects to build yourself.The problem with most self-paced paths is that the instructors shows you something that you copy. But in my past, most of the learning happened when I had to come up with something myself.If you want to invest heavily (time-wise), see the suggestions at [www.teachyourselfcs.com](http://www.teachyourselfcs.com). I can especially recommend \"computer systems: a programmer's perspective\" or https://www.nand2tetris.org/.Not exactly about programming, but an online course that helped me immensly was \"linux mastery\": [https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-mastery)",

The answer is \"Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA\", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.The odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).A potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (\"Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?\"), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.And really, that's the danger. Once you have doubts, and they start to impact whether you'll learn enough, that can stop you. If you had other goals like \"I want to write a small program to play checkers or a simpler game\" then those goals are more achievable right now.I would consider picking a smaller, reachable goal right no, such as, I'm going to spend 3 months taking some online programming course, and see how I feel. If I am still motivated, I'll continue to work on it, rather than make that decision now before you even start.",

        "body": "I'll be completely honest with you, and will go on a bit of a rant here. Do not listen to people saying straight out \"no\", or \"not possible\", or \"not in current market\", they are **fucking idiots**. They are sheep, and you shouldn't concern yourself with their opinion. I mean for real, ask yourself this: \"If i spent 16 hours daily learning, and live & breath programming every day, including weekends and holidays, then would I be able to catch-up and get a job?\". If you frame it like this, then obviously the answer is yes. It's the same concept when people ask you: \"What are the chances that you make 1m$ this year?\" And majority people respond \"1%, 2%\". Then shift the perspective - \"What are the chances you make 1m$ this year, or else your entire family dies?\" Suddenly everyone answers 100%. It's not the goal or timeframe, it's the perspective. My point is, anyone that is so closed minded to give you a definitive answer to a question that is so open-ended, is a dumbass.I am completely self-taught in everything I have done in my life. I dropped out at age of 16 from high school to pursue business, and when my peers were getting their bachelors, I was buying a new apartment. While that sounds great, it took 16 hours daily for years, my health declined hard, and it frankly, wasn't worth it. I wanted more stability in life, where I still make great money, but not at cost of all my time and health. So I started learning programming to transition, and mind you I started in 2024. In a shitty market, filled with the same comments you see on this thread saying you can't do it, CS is dead, there's no jobs etc.Fast forward to today, and with zero YoE on the job, I am interviewing for Mid positions at various companies and tomorrow I have another job interview with F100 company. Was it easy to get to here? No. In the last 365 days, I probably spent 330 or so coding and learning every day for 8-10 hours. Is it doable though? Absolutely. Fucking. Yes.I was like you though, posting threads on reddit asking if there's future. Until I realized that there is future, but only for people who put in the work, and don't spend their time worrying on reddit. Every hour you spend on a real project of yours, is an hour you get ahead others writing posts on reddit. Which reminds me, it's time for me to prep for the interview. Good luck though, believe in yourself and don't give in to haters.",

Knowing the syntax of the language is one thing, but the most important part of coding something is knowing how to think within the bounds of computer language.Once he has some footing, he might want to try out godot. It's what i'm using to make my rhythm game and the coding while incredibly flexible and powerful, has easy to learn syntax. Don't get me wrong it's a proper engine and has all the bells and whistles, but it's accessible compared to something like unreal.The other alternative is gamemaker which doesn't have coding, it has logic blocks that you connect together visually. Unreal has something similar and deeper called blueprints but unreal is the premier game engine on the market, very much not suitable for beginners and the actual coding in unreal is C++, pretty much the most beginner unfriendly (but powerful) language you could learn.",

You should be doing something *every* summer, whether that be gaining new skills or doing an internship.With the current tech industry right now, if you can create a full-stack project and implement GenAI in there, your resume and experience will be **golden (especially as a 3rd year CS major)**. You have HTML and CSS locked in, JavaScript is definitely the next step.Here is a full-stack course that will teach you full-stack development from day one: [https://fullstackopen.com/en/about](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) . This course is definitely doable in 3 months with about 2-4 hours a day.If you are more into low-level coding/embedded systems and would prefer not to step into full-stack engineering, work on some of these low-level coding projects: [https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)If data-science and machine learning are your thing, here is another reference/guide on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g6d4cz/roadmap\\_to\\_becoming\\_an\\_ai\\_engineer\\_in\\_8\\_to\\_12/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g6d4cz/roadmap_to_becoming_an_ai_engineer_in_8_to_12/) . Also check out Kaggle.And since your algorithms skills are weak, brush up on DSA with LeetCode. Trust me, it's not as scary once you practice. All computer science really takes is practice. Make sure to lock in on a specialty during the summer so you aren't bouncing around half-learning a lot of things (my major pitfall). Do at least one problem a day to start.Beyond this, your 3rd-4th year transition summer is crucial to get an internship. And doing these projects will for sure help you land one. Edit: typos",

If you have to really stop and read it, or read it a few times to understand what it does, then your code is not readable.* If you would read it in about a year of not touching this code, would you understand easily what it does? It's easy to read it when you know all the context and all the considerations that are part of it, but you will eventually forget it. What happens then?* Is it easy to understand *why* something a code does something? For example, you do an if check for a specific value. Is the *reason* why we do this value clear? If it's not clear, then a comment should explain it.* Is the code efficient? No need to over-optimize, but we can at least not repeat things that don't need to be repeated. For example, if you need to fetch something that doesn't change during your flow, fetch it once and use it for all relevant operations, rather than fetching it over and over. Same can be said for complex calculations.* Is the code going to external APIs too often? Most APIs are rate limited, and you don't want to overdo it in order to prevent being blocked. Even if a single flow works, what happens if the flow is invoked a few times by multiple users? Some APIs also charge you for each API use, so you want to keep costs down.* Is the context of a flow clear? For example, say a user updates their details and clicks \"Save\". Is it easy to know what user triggered this flow, when, and how? How do you know you're not accidentally saving over the wrong user's data?* Logs and tests: this is for the real world rather for academic tests, but good to keep in mind. Are there useful logs placed in strategic locations in the code to make it easy to follow along a log trail if something goes wrong? Are there tests to make sure that your flow works?Following those points will make sure your code is in at least in a pretty good condition. Of course, the above questions are subjective, but you should be able to answer them for yourself.",

        "body": "I started my professional career with Java. I had written code in some other languages before this. Technically I started with BASIC but I would say that Java was the first language I learned to code in at a professional level.If you have a particularly good reason, like somebody being able to support you, like you have described, then there is no real reason not to start there.That said, in isolation, I would say no. The language designers at Oracle have done a reasonable job of bringing the language up to modern expectations but there is a lot of history there and backwards compatibility to maintain and I think that has resulted in some less than optimal things.The Java platform (distinct from the language) is great, there is a huge ecosystem, lots of libraries and the JVM has some of the most clever engineering that you'll find anywhere. It's a nice platform, but if a person I knew was starting today, and wanted to learn Java platform development I would probably suggest Kotlin over Java. You can still use all of those tools and libraries and run on the JVM but I think it is a nicer way to express yourself and has some really useful features.Independent of even the JVM, i'd probably say that Python is perhaps the best absolute beginner choice. At the risk of upsetting some Python people, I think Python is the closest modern, widely used language to the BASIC that I started with. Obviously people use it for insanely complex stuff (ML in particular) but the syntax is pretty simple and the much maligned, 'meaningful whitespace' feature is actually not bad when it comes to instructing people on writing readable code. The people who complain about Python's indentation semantics are typically indenting their non-Python code in the same way, or their IDE is doing it for them. It's not a big deal.",

In any job, you are going to have good points and bad points. And as real professionals, though, we must find \"stomach\" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.There are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others. For example, Web Development, Frontends, etc. Some people really enjoy doing that kind of work, and others find it kind of dreadful or annoying. You have to learn what kind of programming or systems \"get you up in the morning\" as it were.But if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get \"to the goal\" and that is always a good feeling for me. For example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually \"get it good enough\" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. In any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology). And this is probably ultimately the thing that helps us avoid the so-called \"burn-out\" feeling.",

Or if you studied a foreign language, ask yourself how long it took. Was it just magic that you learned it? Probably not.Learning to program is somewhat similar. You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.There's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.We all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.For a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read. As you do this, you can do the equivalent in C# which is reasonably similar to Java.",

They've shared their desire clearly, so I really just don't understand these replies. If I knew a specific community or project where those skills would be useful, I'd let you know OP, but I just work with different tools. I can say that your best bet might be a gaming community. I've been a part of several communities surrounding games where community members made web apps and other useful tools. None of them are active anymore, but it's a good medium in general to find problems that you could work on together with others. Just have to find the right game, and the right community.

JQuery is really for modifying the DOM (styling and what you see on a webpage) so you can tangibly see your changes happen 'live'.When you boil it right down, JavaScript is really just: * Variables (var, let, const) - places to store bit of data * Arrays and Objects (arrayName[data], objectName{dataKey: data}) - places to store many bits of data that are related to each other * Conditionals (if, else if, else) - ways to run different pieces of code depending on something, usually the value of a variable * Loops (for, while, do while) - ways to run the same piece of code over and over again * Functions (someFunction(someArgument)) - ways to reuse a piece of code in many places without having to re-write it.There are a lot of complicated terms to describe many variations of the same ideas. There can be confusing, but they still really just boil down to these core ideas. Eg \"ternaries\" are just short-hand conditionals. \"Iterations\" are just another work for loops.The problem with Boot Camps is they go so fast. Like showing people a basic `while` loop for the first time than 15 minutes later moving on to telling them how to use `map()`.",

So you don't need to search for it. But you still need to traverse the *k*-1 preceding items to reach your target. That's the access runtime.And so on like that, for all the data structures that have access times listed on that website. But a hash table has no stable order. So there can be no cogent concept of \"accessing the *k*th element\". You have to search every time. (At least that's the argument for the N/A, I think!)",

Usually, you \"access\" an element at some index N, but with Hashsets you typically have no means of accessing elements at a particular index, because that's not really how they work under the hood. So if access here means \"get element at an index in the list\" then yeah it's arguably not applicable. But if you say access means \"accessing the desired slot\" then it's the same as the other operations.",

That's why salaries are good, and still, there are not enough professionals.I think the best thing to do is patiently follow a good book, a good tutorial. A book is written carefully, with research, many times by teachers, thinking about the best way to explain things to students. They thought about what are the most basic concepts, what is a good order of to study concepts to make learning faster.Next time you post, try to write your message with some AI tool, you will get more responses with better writing.

It can probably be done with just some really snarky batch file, depending on what exactly you have and what exactly you need to do beyond the stated stuff. I highly recommend looking into this idea. The learning curve is very low, just poweruser stuff instead of full on software engineering level. that said, a windows .exe file is generated by turning a programming language (the stuff YOU write) into machine code (the .exe file), which is done by the tools (compiler and linker for example in C++) for that programming language. Some languages are 'interpreted' and do not make an executable program, but instead run directly from the source code. That may also be ok for your needs, but any computer using the program would require the tools to run it, which are not default installed on windows. A windows program that makes actual windows (the GUI) take more know-how, as you have to learn the tools to make the windows and widgets on them. This can be little more than glorified drag and drop to build, but even so, there is some learning curve to it. If you don't do those things, the program will be a 'command line program' and work under the cmd shell (dos shell) that you may or may not use (its part of windows). Such programs just accept typed text and print out response text to the shell, 1980s style. Even when you make a windows exe, the target computer may need something you used -- its often a shocker to beginners that other computers lack the debug libraries so debug mode executables won't usually run on other machines. Be sure to run the program on the target machine and that it works properly there.",

It's a simple language with a wide ecosystem so things like working in excel or sending emails are really simple to do. Next, install an interpreter for Python so you can run code you write. [Here's the download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3133/). Download and install it. It will come with a tool called IDLE you can use to write code in. People may prefer other code editors like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that can make writing code easier, so you can look into them but may not see benefit yet. It's worth adding the code interpreter won't create an executable file, but will run your code files. Then pick up a guide for learning Python. There are tons of YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses. Id recommend [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) because it covers everything you want to do.",

        "body": "If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)MinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)WSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.Otherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.On Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.For desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good. If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.Most Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.For editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.So that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.I’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.IIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.On Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.If you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)I recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)If you learn C, K\\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.Good luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",

This loading an object and it's tree would recursively relapd the same two objects infinitely.My only point of disappointment was that I fixed the bug in my dream, and realized I would have to code it again after I woke up",

I would urge programmers to think about code this wayI would also say that induction and recursion are two sides of the same coin, basically opposites. Recursion takes a case and breaks it down into sub-cases until it gets down to a base case. Induction does the opposite - builds from two base cases every possible sub-case.You can prove your code is correct by doing an induction proof on it - proving the base cases are correct, assuming the recursive calls will provide the right answer, and proving your call will produce the correct result. You can also do this with runtime complexity or amortized analysis. A simpler example is something like merge sort. If you can show ordering 1 element works and is ordered, then show that you can correctly merge two ordered sub-lists into an ordered one, you can prove that your code orders the entire array. This is highly applicable to many problems, and you're on the right track",

That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \\^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span. But you can also have methods that take ranges, for instance.",

There's a lag while the data is being fetched and then the page updates. During that lag, there's nothing to indicate that anything's happening.The low-grade way to fix this is to put a spinner or loading bar on page while you wait for the content to be fetched. The much better way of doing this is to render the page on the server. Modern frameworks allow you to do both without much difficulty, especially if you're using Node or Deno to serve your website, and you can also progressively load content over XHR now.I noticed that when I resized the window from a mobile width back to desktop width, the layout was odd. This implies that you're building the page with JS rather than relying on CSS media queries to lay the page out at different screen widths. Ah, `determineLayout` confirms it! You can do a lot more with CSS than you might realise.I see your firebase keys are in your JS config. I guess that means I can use your database at your expense? These should be on the server. At the very least, stick them inside a JWT.Your JS is nice and clean. The way you're populating the DOM is satisfactory for a site this small, but even here, you should be able to reuse components. For example, you have lots of functions that build back buttons (\"back to categories\", back to foobar\", etc). Try and make a single function for that. See if there are other opportunities for code reuse.Also think about using the CSS `:hover`pseudo-selector to make it clear to the user what elements are interactive. I notice you can't `tab` into those back buttons either.",

In many cases this is a preferred, like if you are working with payments systems or areas where everything needs to be perfect.But part of any job is adjusting your patterns to best serve your stakeholders. If that means more expediency and less attention to details, then you should consider adapting. But you need to exercise judgement too. If you are being asked to move faster but it needs to be perfect (again, payments or similar), then you may need to push back and assure you are working as fast as you can to meet the expectations.",

        "body": "I’m a software development manager, and I’ve had to give that kind of feedback before. The reality is, every task comes with drivers and constraints. If the business wants something done, it’s because it provides value—but that value only matters if the costs (like time and effort) don’t outweigh the benefits.If your manager brought this up, I hope they were direct about it. There should be no mystery here. Understanding the \"why\" behind the feedback is important: it's often about balancing quality with efficiency.Here’s how you can tackle it:1. **Improve your estimating skills.** Be realistic about how long tasks will take, and speak up if the deadline is too tight.2. **Include contingency in your estimates.** Plans rarely go perfectly—account for interruptions, unexpected challenges, and even just bad days.3. **Prioritize effectively.** Focus on the essentials first—what absolutely needs to get done. That way, if setbacks happen, you can adjust without missing the core requirements.4. **Apply the 80/20 rule.** Recognize that 20% of the work usually delivers 80% of the value. Tackle that first, and you’ll find the rest often falls into place more easily.Finally, self-assess and seek guidance. Understand your manager’s expectations, find a mentor for candid feedback, and always keep sharpening your skills—not just new ones, but fundamentals too.The goal isn’t just to avoid criticism; it’s to become more effective and confident in your work.**Addendum:** Before I get waves of criticism—yes, I did use AI to help generate this response. But let me be clear: every thought and idea here is my own.I’m mentioning this because, fittingly enough, I often struggle with being too slow and too detailed when writing responses. To address that, I use GPT by giving it an outline my points, tell it my preferred tone, and have it draft a response efficiently. I’ve given it instructions on how I like to communicate and trained it to match my general style.Some might be offended by that, but the reality is: this technology is here. I’m using Reddit as a learning ground—not just for discussions but for honing my ability to work with emerging tools. If we don’t learn how to use it effectively, someone else will. Personally, I’d rather be ahead of that curve.This is the same technology that is being integrated into software development tools and can be a great factor in increasing productivity--and increasing performance expectations. The challenge is to ensure the quality matches and exceeds the productivity gains.Adapt or get left behind—that's how I see it.",

This process was 100% CPU bound for the duration of the scan (which could be a couple of minutes).So I created a scheduler thread which would maintain the list of files to be scanned and \"scanning slots\". There was one slot per core on the CPU the process was running on. So, when there was a free core, the scheduler would create a thread and cause it to run the scan for the specified file.This involved a but of Thread management and process coordination via semaphores and single entry functions to coordinate the allocation and release of slots for the individual processes.When it ran, the system would be fully CPU bound for the duration of the process which on a fast system took about 24 hours. On \"standard corporate issue\" systems it would take about 4-5 days to run. Single threaded, we estimated it would run for close to 2 weeks on a decent system.You might also want to look into SMP, MPP and Grid systems.",

They're bundled executable code for Windows to use.For python you have the .pyc file which is there to bootstrap things. The .pyz contains the actual code to run. And then the .pyd and dll files contain code that supports the app.But again, this is really something you never need to fuss about in all but the most odd of circumstances. It's comparable to the build folder in NodeJS. It's not there for you; it's there for the computer. And if you find yourself picking through it something has probably gone very wrong.",

Linux uses .elf, MacOS uses Mach-O, Windows uses PE ( I might be referencing old info here ).An executable and linkable format usually contains 3 possible forms:1. An end executable, which is an object file that has been linked, and it holds several things, like .code section, .data section, can also hold dynamic data if it links against a dynamic lib.2. An archive or static library, which is an agglomerate of object files, that are solely meant to be used as files to be linked against during compile time.3. A dynamic library, which is an object file, with a special format, that allows it to be placed on some part of the memory, and allows any program to link against it during load time.How does the overall loading process occur? Well it's actually quite expensive and full of things. It contains things like creating a new process for the executable, then mapping the correct memory for that executable, placing MMU restrictions, linking against a dynamic library if the executable requires it, and many other things. I've never actually worked directly with loaders, so can't tell you for sure, but I am 100% sure it's doing all of these things, and probably even more.",

I doubt it would work on any arbitrary exe.Unless the process of pyinstaller is 100% reversible, you're likely not looking at exactly the original source code, just something that's probably functionality equivalent. You'd have to look into specifics of both pyinstaller and the extractor library to know more. Much of what you're seeing is probably not used on your specific machine, maybe there for compatibility purposes. If you can get the actual project source code access that would be better.

Usually its bundled with with custom scanners and printers and a POS system, or an MRP/ERP, or some other PM suite. Excel is a half measure here. Or a PTO tracker, which is ALWAYS bundled with an HR suite. Payroll drives so much of SMB software decisions and every system is missing something.>How many businesses are you dealing with?

I was able to save the current business I'm working with about $175k annually over the last year and half by pruning their trivial shit. They were paying an MSP to \"manage\" their cable modem. $500 a month for 10 years. The MSP came out 3 times in 10 years to watch a cable tech swap out the modem for $500 a month.I can say the first thing you shouldn't do is say to the customer that they are your first. You can't show the emotion you might not realize you're showing. You have to show them you're willing and able to walk out of the meeting at any time.\"I don't discuss my existing client business with others. But, let's just say that I was provided the opportunity to explore this entrepreneurial endeavor with some assurances and I'm not concerned at all about the solvency of my business in the short or long term.If you have concerns about bandwidth, I have existing and on-going business relationships with several established firms and individuals that exist inside and outside this country. Due to the range of unique requests I get from my clients that require specialized expertise the expense of a subcontractor is no different than the cost of burden to staff my own business. With my approach I get to leverage the different expertise of each firm rather than to be locked into a few skillsets. In addition to all of that, my business structure gives me the ability to scale based on project requirements without having to resort to end of project layoffs.Of course I am continuing to internally contract a few very qualified persons for a premium, but I am fortunate enough to have the luxury to take my time and cherry pick the right people. Typically these are not customer facing engineers unless the project requirements demand face-to-face or on-site time. I will be your point of contact, and available to contact 24/7. I'm not looking to be the next Facebook, I'm looking to establish a few quality business relationships that will last for years, ideally until I retire and pass the business on to my successor.I understand if this dynamic doesn't appeal to you. Not every contractor is for every client, and the last thing I want is to enter a business relationship where one side is unhappy. This is an interview for me as well as an interview for you.\"Take that and make it yours. Make it the first time...every time!",

You'll be paid to implement them.So, to become a good developer you don't have to think of original ideas at all. You can learn just by cloning existing apps.Why not just pick some of your favorite apps and try to clone them?

This isn't to build the next big project because if you are still at the learning phase the chances of you creating a project that would \"make money\" is pretty slim at the beginning and even years into your career. NOW this is actually to your benefit, find a project you like/use and recreate it. The reason this is beneficial is you already know all the things to build when a lot of times ppl try and build stuff but never have a set of requirements.The whole \"build something you are interested in\" are to make sure the person keeps on building it so while I agree it's not helpful in giving you an actual \"thing\" to build it's usually beneficial because ppl quit projects they lose interest in.So the TLDR; you aren't building this to be the next tech bro and get super rich so if you don't wanna pick something that involves your interests pick something that already exists and then you have a list of reqs to build and then build it. And hell maybe there is something in that tool/thing you like that is missing and you can add that.",

Core gameplay revolves around narration regarding each scene and the npcs within them. So you enter a scene, the narrator describes what you see and who is in there. You can choose to examine objects or areas within the environment or speak to npcs. There will be a lot of multiple choice and stat checking/ability rolls. Which produce branching dialogue and events. I intend to have voice actors, so I will need to sync voice lines with text. If you're familiar with Disco Elysium or Planscape: Torment, it's basically that genre but no graphics besides static background images.",

Arduino would be a cool next step with a different language as well but arduino has a vast online community which is helpful with learning. Raspberry Pi is another option but I would start with Arduino as you get a chance at another language with a system that has a lot of support. Plus in my opinion building with Arduino seems more versatile and probably closer to what you would be wanting to make. Side note would be the esp32 can use micro Python but I vote start with Arduino’s original language. Cheer and enjoy!",

Take a break, do whatever your hobby is for a day or two and don't think about the search. It's perfectly reasonable to take a momentary break and reset.You'll find your first job. It might not be as glamorous as what you see on here but it will come. 145 in two days is kinda crazy but I like the hustle. Here's what I would do instead tho, stop tweaking the resume. Instead make two, say one that focuses on whatever your strengths are(if your internships were more backend or data whatever) and the other more general jack of all trades. Try your best to schedule out your job searches. Meaning, you spent x hours applying then stop. You're already burning yourself out and it isn't working. Spend the rest of the time upskilling and working on projects. Build shit for fun or profit doesn't matter really, just keep learning.",

So what’s going on?Job seekers are applying to jobs in extreme excess. This completely clocks the ATS systems and HR. You have thousands of applications for positions. Many aren’t qualified. And some of very well qualified.Well, the very well qualified people get reviewed and are the first called. But often times; they weren’t even interested in the job but the ease of applying made them keep their feelers open. So jobs get bombarded with all sorts of applicants. And we’ve hit a bottleneck. There’s a large pool of applicants and the corporate team wants the absolute best. You get looked over for the top 10% of applicants. And the top 10% of applicants are probably looking for employment elsewhere.",

Two different managers. Once made my life annoying and another manager made my life great, while simultaneously getting me promoted.I have friends who work at Meta, Amazon, Apple, Pinterest. Your manager and the team hiring you matter more than the average company culture.Like I’d say avoid Doordash, but tbh you could be joining under a really great manager.Sidenote: I’ve known two people who joined Amazon. They both hated it. And two others who have been at Amazon for the past 5 years, and are still there.Also for Uber: tell them about your competing offers, and get a sign-on bonus. Or ask any of the companies what signing bonuses they can offer.Hint: lately the cap I’ve seen amongst my friends job hopping the past 6 months has been $50K.",

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.Tech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the \"not-so-passionate\" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.Could there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec \"overheard\" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.So yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real. But if you're banking on market-wide comp dropping because of wishful exec thinking, you're betting on unicorns *and* leprechauns.",

The recruiter is a real piece of shit and is putting their thumb on the scale by pushing you to $180k so that they can tell the hiring manager you are expensive, making the candidate that the *recruiter* favors more likely to get the job.2. The recruiter is looking out for your best interest and doing you a favor - even if you don't get an offer. Sometimes the recruiter knows that salary will not be a factor in the final hiring decision. When I've hired, whenever there were high quality interviews, salary was the last thing I or anyone in the process cared about. Getting the call right on picking a high performer was all that mattered. Salary was only a factor when all of the candidates were meh and you didn't think getting a high performer was a likely outcome.The reason for the dynamic in point 2 is simple. If you are a manager and hire a high performer, it makes what you deliver look good to your boss. In this scenario the boss will almost never care if the high performer's salary is high for the organization's salary bands or the salary is above market. It's the opposite. They will worry about retention if the salary is low. If you hire a mediocre performer, the boss will have questions. Being able to say that the person's salary is below market and you can't replace them without paying more can be satisfactory.",

Hardly anyone will tell you this, because it's likely you don't have anyone close enough in your life that you wouldn't immediately push away, if they pressed you to pursue getting help. That is a sign of the problem, in addition to spending several years and not actually getting software dev experience, which speaks to fundamental motivation. (It is worth asking the question: you've done some of it, do you enjoy doing it at all?)Get signed up for whatever affordable coverage you can and go find a therapist that has a background in depression, addiction, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.If you really don't know where to start, go to a Gambling Addictions Anonymous meeting. You don't have to buy into it all the way. It will give you a place to say your piece, as well as talk to people who have gone through similar things, de-stigmatizing the shame.People are saying quit trading and gambling. You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. You need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).This stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am. Stop reading this, and go do that immediately. Can't do it right now? Write it on a note and put it on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Somewhere you can't ignore. Just do what it takes to deal with this. If you actually do nothing about it, nobody will care about your suffering. Why do I say this? Because everything I have seen you write indicates an immaturity in dealing with the consequences of your own actions. You need to own that first, and you need to help yourself. Because you have created problems that will take years to solve, and you have to be the one to do it. The upside is you will feel better when you actually start doing working on it. Congratulations on making it this far, and good luck.",

I also passed other technical interviews that were much harder.Or for #5, during my job search I forgot that an interview was scheduled for a Tuesday and not a Thursday. Beat myself up for the rest of the day about that one and had to get my partner to write the apology email because I was too ashamed to.

It used to be that internships and personal projects were good ways to get your foot in the door instead of bare minimums to get an interview, and this higher bar for literally no more pay (and in fact what appears to be a stagnation or even a contraction in wages) is part of what's enshittifying this industry.

We interviewed 12 candidates out of 500 for internship this year so it's really irrelevant if we get 1000 or 200 or 3000 apps, result is the same. The number of interviews or roles available doesn't scale with applicant effort. There's always going to be winners and losers but the market will dictate how many winners vs losers there are.There are going to be those who gets ahead while doing less than those who do more.

Things like, requests from my manager to do re-writes to documents 15 minutes before they’re presented were common or the doc you pre-read last night is nothing like the one they want to discuss this morning.",

I don't want to work somewhere shitty, and I still have ample savings. I am working, but not as much as I want to be.Part of why it's been so long is I am not \"grinding\" applications. I've done some traveling. I've done some grinding. I am at the point where I'm getting more serious, though, as it has been much longer than I expected.My resume doesn't have a gap, but I have found response rates for initial interviews to be pretty abysmal. Better as of late, though, but I often wonder if I should just accept the gap and remove the freelance from my resume. Some companies have indicated in conversations that it can make them wary of whether or not I want a full time position.",

I think I mostly told people that I was taking some time for myself to focus on hobbies to wait for the job market to improve a little. The truth was that I was still applying to jobs pretty consistently and getting rejected or ghosted, but to be fair, some of those were definitely due to companies having layoffs and no longer hiring for the position. Also, the personal hobby I was the most focused on was building my wedding photography business, which I didn't share with recruiters bc I didn't want them thinking it might get in the way of being a dedicated full-time employee.Edited to add: I'd also sometimes talk about how I wasn't in a huge rush to get back into the job market and was just keeping an eye out for the Right Opportunity.",

They gave me guest version control account, a restricted repository, branch and requested an MR for the loosely described task. Nothing was off the limit. I used documentations, internet and AI to complete the task. After that submission got cleared and a follow up was arranged I had near 2 hours with 2 engineers going over all details of my submission. Ran the project locally and they asked me key performance and functionality questions. We discussed the shortcomings of my submission and what I could have done better… totally open conversation with many back and forth exchanges. Impossible to fake if you haven’t done the work or used AI without understanding. This is where they actually verify it all. Having done these interviews I always left with the confidence that these guys know what they’re doing, and that I was respected as an adult. Not surprisingly, working with them has been a similar experience. I spend more time finding these companies than actual interviews. It’s not easy to come across such companies which also have great compensation and interesting projects so I have very specific set of questions to narrow down at the initial interview.

It’s definitely something that would heavily feature in the following interview. It is *much* better to have something real to talk about.Edit: I shouldn’t have said “solving a real problem” because people can get hung op on that. What I mean is that it’s a genuine project with a purpose that the author came up with. Could be really anything including stuff that has been done many times before (eg. home automation, etc)",

I've seen candidates who'd just completely stolen someone else's entire repo and not even bothered to check copyright notices which pointed back to the original author.It got to the point where reviewing candidates' repos was not fruitful until much later in the process (I.e. when it was down to the final selection).So have a repo, but make sure it's good and don't pad it with trash or stolen code.",

Your resume is supposed to be a summary document to pull people in. Just tossing a link out and expecting them to go dig out the highlights themselves is lazy, and unrealistic.But if one of your projects you list on your resume happens to grab someone's attention, *then* they might think about giving your GitHub a visit. Not the reverse.If you feel your side projects aren't worthy of being put directly on your resume, then they're not really the type of projects you want showing off to employers in the first place.Not to mention recruiters are the 1st people to see your resume, and recruiters don't know what the fuck any of the stuff on your GitHub means. Know your audience. Recruiters have a large stack of resumes they need to sift through to find some diamonds in the rough.

I decided to try out faang and the last 3 years was very stressful. I just couldnt understand the codebase and how things connected. J wasnt a great communicator either and struggled to find the right resources for help. The job was very demanding. I got fired this year due to low perforamance. I made sure to get a new job that would be more in line with having good work life balance ans not be so demanding. Even if it meant i had to take less. Im currently working for a new job and it seems it wont be too demanding so far. The first thing they told me was “if you want to be the guy who works 40 hours and gets your task done. You can have a long career here. If you want to prioritize getting promoted quickly and working a bit extra. We just advise you respect your work life balance.”Edit: just to add. I think if you found something that was more chill, even if the pay was a but less or the benefits werent the best, you should do it.",

It takes a lot of effort. Anyone can do it but the vast majority of people don’t like it enough to study it constantly for years until they get paid to do it. If you drop everything, quit your job, and study, you should be prepared to invest a lot of time.The market isn’t the best right now. Not as bad as some say but it’s definitely not great. Out of my graduating cohort of like 50 students, I think maybe 10 percent are working as software engineers. Who knows where the market will be by the time you’re looking for a job but the optimist in me says it should be better. That said, it’s still a risk.

In 2021, I think I sent 20 applications and heard back from half of them. This year I lost count but it was in the first couple hundreds and I only heard from like 10 of them. Thankfully one of them realy wanted me and I got a job wihtin 3 months but Id still be jobless if it wasnt for that one job as most places I havent heard back from yet.I dont mean to scare you, I dont think it's impossible but you will have to be patient and do extra work to get callbacks. My adivce, apply everywhere. The job I got I had applied in december and didnt hear from them until april. So really if something pops up, apply and dont give up because you didnt hear back from them. Use linkedin and indeed (and other 3rd party sites) as search engines only. I would find positions and immedately apply through the company site. I dont know if this is true but Ive heard company sites will not look at 3rd party applications if they get enough from their main site. Use AI as a proofreader for your resume. You should write your own resume and then put it in AI. Dont copy-paste everything they say, more like use some phrases and mixi it inwith your resume to make it sound like a human made it.",

Hell, even if you murdered someone and went to jail for decades, you could probably recover.That said, don't try to judge the market by looking at others. The one and only way to know how the market is going to treat *you* is by applying yourself. The market does not treat everyone equally. For example, I job searched in 2024 with 11 YOE, and didn't struggle at all to find a job. And yet I see countless stories of people with the same YOE as me, or more, post on this subreddit (in 2024, and now) complaining how they can't even get a single interview.It can be hard to believe if your one and only source of information is this subreddit, but there are plenty of people with 2 YOE out there that aren't struggling at all to find a job. There's also plenty of new grads lining up just fine as well. They just aren't posting on an advice subreddit, because they *don't need advice*.Not only all that, but the market was *also* bad in 2023. Yet look at you! You got a job with 0 YOE! You must be doing something right. Something that a lot of other people in 2023 weren't doing, because there were tons of people struggling back then as well. So presumably youl'l be doing that same thing right today.You're worrying before even trying. Come back to us in a few months if you can't find a job.",

That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.EDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.The idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.It's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.Now, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.I think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.I think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",

You can read the code it outputs, but trust me - you can't understand it. Learning programming up to professional level is all about hitting those walls for weeks at time before it all ,,clicks''. You're saying that it would take 4x as long to learn - I'm saying that it's probably 20-30x longer - and that's the process that you consider ,,skipping'' now.Consider this: If OpenAI has a week long outage can you be productive or do you take that week off because it's like someone turned your brain off?To work in this industry, you **need** to be able to code, brainstorm and reason about the flow of logic in a big complex project. If you don't do it, you're maybe 20% better than a rando of a street after 2 weeks of crash course on vibe coding because you have algo/ds classes over him. You're still not getting a job from me.I'm a Principal SWE at a big company with over 10 years of experience and when we interview we would never hire a person that cannot code without AI assistance.

I can do so completely unregulated, as much or as little as I want.A doctor may love treating patients, but as soon as they retire that's the end of it for them. They can't continue treating patients post-retirement. That's a very, very, very, very different decision for them than it is for us.I love programming. But I can, and will, continue programming post-retirement. There's no decision at all for me. The minute it makes financial sense, I will retire. I won't \"work\" a minute more than I need to, because *work sucks*.

Everything went so much smoother having the same device as my team members, *especially* onboarding.I've done that at every job since.

As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.Then the expectation that is being set to you is higher than the increase output that AI is giving you. AKA, they are asking you to do too much than your capacity is actually at. You have two choices, and one of them is the incorrect choice. The wrong choice is work extra hours to meet these expectations. This is the wrong choice because all this will do is set this as the new norm expectation and will also give them permission to push you further when crunch time happens. You will never benefit from this choice and will pay the price later on for it when you don't meet expectations when the expectations go up.Choice two is you clearly communicate in sprint planning that the stories being provided to you and your team is too high. You communicate that clearly as a team to the manager. If the manager doesn't care, cool. Then don't meet the goals and clearly communicate in retro why that wasn't done. Also, document in email writing somewhere so you have proof this was communicated to the manager. Not in a adversarial way. Just a way so they can't come back and claim no one told them.Then let manager deal with fallout of not meeting plans. As that is there job, not yours. Your job is just to do the tasks you are assigned and clearly communicate to the manager when expectations are being set are not realistic.If this is a problem for your manager, then you need to look for a new employer.

Share that data with your manager and ask to rebalance the sprint or drop low-impact tasks. Solid numbers make these conversations easier.Also set a weekly learning slot. Block one evening to explore a new pattern or dig into a library without any deliverable attached. Protecting that time reminds you why you love coding.Finally lean on your team. If juniors are leading initiatives, ask to pair or rotate tasks so you can mentor and learn side by side.

A few years ago, following something like this would almost gaurantee you a job. THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. Without a degree, and without experience, practically no company in America will hire you for a CS related job. No matter how skilled you are, it doesnt matter because there are so many good candidates with degrees struggling. Why would a company do the effort to evaluate you, when they can spend that effort interviewing people with a CS degree. Maybe in the future, something like this and bootcamps will be viable again. But I don't see that happening anytime soon. If you want to work in this field, you need a degree at the bare minimum. Something like WGU would at least get you past the automated resume checker. This pathway would not. Following something like this, if you were lucky and skilled, might lead to a job where you are underpaid and overworked to get your foot in the door at best. Most likely you won't even get a single interview. I'm sorry it's this way, and this situation brings me no pleasure, but this is the simple truth.",

Before 2022, the need for junior level developers was a lot higher, but with outsourcing and AI, junior level tasks no longer need an associate to complete. Not to mention during Covid, overhiring was ramped and some companies are still trimming the fat with layoffs.As a graduate you are expected to have atleast one internship under your belt, with a year of experience, and a deep understanding of CS. CsMajors who lack a portfolio or skills will not make it through technical interviews but will beat out ATS filtering because of the degree. I would say also, the notion the average CS major can’t code is relatively false on average, an average CS graduate is relatively capable, but there is roughly bottom 20% who are completely lost. Now keep in mind there are fewer jobs in SWE then their used to be, and more CS graduates both in Bachelors and Masters programs then ever before. Most good companies will receive 100s of applicants and have only 2 jobs available. From a business perspective, why not filter by degrees and get an academically strong candidate with experience and a portfolio. To beat this out you will likely need a strong open source portfolio, with live production level applications and very good networking, I can not emphasize this enough, without a degree you will need to be well networked. It’s possible but it is an uphill battle often as you don’t have the resources of college students or a piece of paper saying you know what you know. Again I’m not saying you shouldn’t try, but I am trying to warn you, switching into tech rn, might not be as easy as it was once advertised. Best of luck, I really do not envy people looking to get into tech today.As for my creds… I was a college TA and tutor for CS classes, currently a SWE and I conduct interviews at my current company. If you want specific advice, I’d be happy to help.",

And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.You just answered your own question, you *feel insecure*. I think you just brushed this off, but it sounds like you feel the need to constantly validate and confirm your worth due to insecurity. Hopefully it should go away once you get some experience under your belt, or if your priority in life changes(such as getting a partner, getting married, starting a family, etc.).Not every successful engineer becomes an icon in the tech world, a social media influencer, or even a revered name that is whispered among their peers. While some become celebrities in their own domains, others prefer a life of quiet anonymity. > But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, career advancement almost entirely depends on perception. Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.This is because you surround yourself with people who believe in this and actively participate in this grind. Will this culture always exist? Sure, but you don't have to feel like it's the only way and that you're a prisoner to that way of life.",

But I think you’re thinking about it too simply, and the way you’re approaching it is (at least slightly) counterproductive. It is valuable to be perceived as competent, confident, and personable. When switching jobs, making new connections, or seeking capital investment, peoples default assumption will be that the MIT grad who’s a staff engineer at FAANG is smarter/more capable than the state school grad working in QA at northwest mutual. But I think at some point, you cross a vague threshold where you’re taken seriously at a glance and you don’t really need to worry about micromanaging “prestige”. I’d even say that continuing to be visibly/noticeably concerned with prestige is a negative signal if you’ve already “made it” into high scale software development. It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. Strongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning. I don’t mean this in a flippant way, but agonizing about picking meta or google or citadel for prestige reasons is probably a question for therapy. It sounds like you’ve overcome a lot of challenges to get where you are. I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. But things aren’t as Machiavellian as you’re thinking. People aren’t going to go out of their way to help that person who wouldn’t ever shut up about how awesome they are and how many other offers they got and how hard it was to choose because they’re so impressed with them. People roll their eyes at that person and try to avoid talking to them again. People go out of their way to help the person who worked together with them on some project that neither of them remember, but they had a fun rivalry going on the Tetris machine at the office.",

I've made the transition from startups and mid-sized, low-billions-valuation companies to FANG. It wasn't hard for me to get interviews, as this was many years ago when FANG recruiters would reach out on LinkedIn and such. It was harder to get offers (there's more luck involved than anyone tells you), but I managed to do it by Leetcoding and really trying to understand the algorithms and patterns instead of memorizing solutions. There has been Leetcode escalation since my time there, but I don't have enough interview experience these days to tell you how much.I think if you're just in it for the TC and/or life experience to be at a FANG/Fortune 5 company first hand, then definitely at least try it so you don't feel like you missed something. I'm glad I did just so I knew what it was like.I would recommend against it if you are expecting to seriously level up your dev game. If you're already a highly productive dev at your company and you deliver things faster than your peers and understand all of the tradeoffs of your tech, then you probably won't learn as much as you might think. You'll probably just learn how to use their old, custom tools that solve the same problems you've already solved at your startup but with more popular, open-source tools. Some of what you hear about crazy WLB is because at one point (and maybe still, I don't know) FANG was hiring a ton of new grads who didn't know anything and then were dropped in the deep end. I wasn't at FANG very long, but I still saw many interns and new grad hires cycle through my team and it seemed like a lot of what they didn't like were just things they didn't know because they had no other work experience.I can't say it was the right move career wise because I'm personally of the belief that FANG doesn't have the reputation it once had and could be off-putting to some in this hyper-polarized society we live in now. Many of my teammates at a local company would actively trash FANG and viewed people who worked there as being active and willing participants in hurting society (not joking). At the very least, I suspect saying you worked at FANG today will be kind of like hearing another dev tell you about how they worked at Yahoo in the '90s. Maybe a cool story but won't really open any doors. But I have no regrets!Best of luck to you!",

Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for \"git\" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do \"managed projects with git\" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.Also, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about \"non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.And also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.Anyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative. And it's probably even harder with the economy contracting. But I started my career at the start of the great recession, so there's some hope it's not as bad as that.",

A blanket resume usually has a hard time getting selected, in my experience. To do this, look at the job description and try to line up your skills to what the company is looking for. You don't need to be experienced in everything to land a job.Some things to try, if you haven't tried already:1. I believe UT allows you to use some of their services as a grad. If so, see if career services are one of them. They can provide advice. And if you can attend their in-person career fairs, I would attend those. I always had better experiences when I can see the person who accepts my resume.2. Instead of checking online, drive around and see what businesses are available. Then check their careers' site page if they have one. Not all companies advertise on social media.3. Since you are in Texas, there are a lot of state-based companies with software jobs. HEB corporate, USAA, etc. Check out their site pages. I never really had good luck applying on social media.4. See if there are local career fairs to attend (not school ones). I believe that with Google searches, you can find a fair in your area.These are tough times. I hope only for the best for you. Good luck!",

Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.Therefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: \"This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager\". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations. IMO, it says there's a blind spot in your understanding of where you fit into the workplace, and therefore I'd encourage you to sit down 1v1 with the lead and get their opinion on whether or not you're on track, or what else you could do.",

You don’t need to pick a major right away, and you should explore that especially in the first year or so.2. I would say, you should ask yourself what is something YOU would want to build, and try to find resources online that tell you how to build it. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy, maybe a small tip calculator project or something. If it’s something you can figure out, and you find that you enjoy doing it, then there’s a good chance that you’ll enjoy a career in CS and could potentially figure it out in time. If you find that it’s too confusing to do even a small simple project or that you absolutely hated doing it, then this is probably not the career for you. Most engineers would tell you, the reason they enjoy CS is that feeling you get when you spent hours trying to figure out how to do that one thing and FINALLY figure it out. There is no better feeling. The reason I got into programming was because I liked making mods for games.3. Explore IT a bit too, look into networking, security, hardware, etc. I’m not in IT, so I can’t give you as much advice on it. But before you decide on a major, be sure it’s something you could see yourself doing everyday. You don’t want to waste time and money on a major that you hate.",

I struggled to get good offers 3 years ago but wound up with 4 this time around. My personal experience actually ran inverse to the general sentiment here, in no small part due to improving my abilities and getting more strategic with my career and interviewing (plus some general maturity).You have a set of unique circumstances and personality that make up you as a candidate and all you can do is maximize your chances and adjust your approach based on your results. Never ever let someone else's experience influence your mindset before you even go out and see results for yourself. If you don't get calls back or you bomb some interviews then fine you deal with that and adjust, but your journey is yours alone and is rarely made better by internalizing the struggles of others before you even tried yourself.",

        "body": "If you work at a company that is expected to be online 24/7, there will always be 24/7 on call. So if the on call by itself is your issue, you'd need to look for teams whose products are only used during business hours. They're definitely out there, but not super common.From a rotation/frequency standpoint what you're describing is pretty standard. I've been on call at every company I've worked for, the rotations have always lasted 2 weeks, and the frequency of rotation obviously depended on how large the team was.The issue to me personally would be the amount of calls you're getting after hours. The word \"normal\" isn't a useful term to use for things like this, because being called super frequently absolutely *is* normal at a lot of companies. But it's not normal at others. There isn't an industry-wide normality you can refer to, there's a lot of variety.One thing I make it a point to do when I'm reverse-interviewing is discuss exactly this. I ask about rotation, how many times they get after-hours calls, business-hours calls, an example of what the team did in reaction to an after hours call, etc. I'm trying to establish the product stability and the team norms so I can decide to join or not.What I'm usually looking for when I ask about after-hours calls is a few calls *per year*. After hours calls need to be treated extremely seriously, and should be \"Fix ASAP\" kind of issues. If the product is so on fire that they can't keep up with patching after-hours issues, and you're getting called even once a week, I want no part of that product.When I was job searching in 2021 I had offers from several companies. When I asked one of them about after-hours calls, the hiring manager smiled and proudly said \"we only get a few calls a month!\".... the fact that was *good* in their mind set off alarm bells in mine. Another company responded \"Well the product's only a couple years old, but we've never been called after hours so far, most of our support issues are during business hours\". Green flag. I joined them. I only ended up staying there about 2.5 years, but I indeed got called 0 times after hours during that time.",

We get paid a retainer for the shift which works out to approximately 1-2 hours of pay for week days, and it’s double at weekends, quadruple on bank holidays. If there is an incident outside of work hours, then we get paid OT for dealing with it, starting from 1 hour and otherwise rounded to the nearest 30 mins.

It was what created the bootcamp/self-teaching craze, where anyone could drop some money on a 1-month bootcamp and land a 6-figure job without a degree. Demand greatly outpaced supply. New grads were easily breaking in, experienced devs were job hopping for insane salary increases... it was chaos.I ask because this is a very different conversation if most of your applying happened in 2020 (bad market from covid), and 2023-2025 (bad market thanks to 2021-2022), versus if you were trying in the golden era.If you were trying in the golden era with a CS degere and weren't getting interviews... something's very wrong. I have some complaints about your resume (that might be more relevant in todays market), but none that would warrant 0 responses in the golden era, it's not *that* bad. One thing I would definitely do is remove your Civil Engineering degree. Generally you only want to list *relevant* skills/qualifications on your resume. While getting that degree is an impressive feat, it's not relevant if you want to be a SWE. I'd give the same advice about your sales experience, you can keep that there, but you should be leaning into the soft-skills side of it to tie it back to something employers value in a SWE. Exceeding sales targets is not relevant to being a SWE. But I bet you picked up some really strong communication skills from that role, talk about *that.* Try reading through your whole resume with that in mind: \"What am I trying to communicate to the reader here? Is this relevant to SWE?\".What kinds of roles were you applying to? Were you just applying to roles grossly outside your qualifications? What kinds of companies? Large F500 companies are much more likely to hire new grads than small companies for example., if your search was focused on small companies in your local town that could be a problem. Are you willing to relocate? Relocation is the norm for your first job out of college, even in good markets. That could be an issue if you're not. Are you applying just in the \"sexy\" cities, or are you branching out to cities that people aren't dying to move to? Are you trying to immigrate to the US or something?The issue is if you're not getting calls, there's not really that much that *could* be wrong. It's pretty much either your resume, or the companies/roles/locations you're applying for. Even in this market, despite what this subreddit may lead you to believe, there are plenty of new grads getting jobs lined up out of college so just putting all the blame on the market is not productive.",

I think the general consensus is that new grads need about 6 months to fully onboard and become truly productive, contributing members of their teams. So in effect, to potential employers, you only have 6 months of actual experience doing the job. Again, that isn’t nothing, but it *really* isn’t much. Then there’s the question of why you’re looking for a new job so soon, and by that point it’s probably a tough sell unless you have a good referral that can vouch for you (also unlikely with only 1 YOE).By all means apply for roles that you find interesting and aren’t much of a stretch, but you’re up against some decent headwinds that will affect your success rate.",

I think it's fine to have a similar resume as you dont really have that much experience so they may see you as a college grad hire with some experince. Add your current experience and when asked, tell them more or less what you said here. Say you felt the job wasnt in line with what you wanted for yourself. As for promotions, it may hold you back a year. Really depends on job and on you. Promotions arent really due to YOE. It's a factor but really promotions are due to your output. If your output is expected than expect 2-3 years to get promoted. If you always over-perfrom expect to get promoted quickly. It's easier to go from SWE1 to SWE2 than it is to SWE2 to Sr SWE. Basically the higher you go up the harder it becomes to go to the following level. So you aren't really in a bad position. If you try to overperform your first year you may get promoted between 12-18 months at the job.",

For what it's worth, you might have more luck applying to FAANG and being open to relocating. Out of hundreds of applications, Meta is the only one who extended an offer to me. They're doing a lot of hiring at the moment. My experience in general over the last year is that there's a lot more opportunity in Silicon Valley right now than anywhere else (although that's kind of always been true).",

They won't ask HR for a reference, HR is just there to confirm your title and dates of employment for a background check. I've also never heard of a company asking HR about \"reason for leaving\", I *really* doubt HR would be willing to answer that even if they knew. At most they might say \"fired\" or \"left of their own accord\". The more details HR gives, the more liable the company becomes at no benefit to them. That's something they may ask *you*, but definitely not HR.So that said, the exit survey is something only HR is going to see and care about. Answer it, don't answer, lie, tell the truth, it's not really gonna matter. In no world is HR going to respond to a background check saying \"Yeah, pinkbutterfly22 was great, but they didn't fill out their exit survey so we wouldn't recommend you hire them\". HR is going to strictly say \"pinkbutterfly22 worked as a SWE from X to Y\".I personally don't tell the company where I'm going, or even the real reason of why I'm leaving. I don't *lie*, I just give non-answers. \"I was just looking for a new adventure\" or some BS for why I'm leaving. For where I'm going \"To a \\[large/small\\] company in \\[industry\\]\" is the most I ever give. I don't really like lying, but I have no issue with dodging questions. When I give that response they know what's up, and don't dig.As for your manager/co-workers, *those* are the people that'll be giving you references because you give your new company their contact info directly. From their perspective, as long as you were decent to work with, and you put in your 2 weeks notice, no bridge is burnt. That's all you're really obligated to do. If you think your colleagues that you hated wouldn't give you a reference... don't ask. Only ask for references from people that you know will say good things about you.",

They're obviously evaluating you for a lot of other things.I actually had a coding challenge for a frontend role where I was supposed to build something in 90min and when they showed me the prompt, in my head i said to myself> there's no goddamn way that anyone will ever be able to build this in 90minand saying that to myself i felt pretty relaxed.of course i didn't tell them that it was too much and i just moved fwd with the problem to see how far i could get. At most I finished half of the requirements. there was a session after for a group of engs to discuss my app, which looked like a piece of shit.

I was kind of hoping they'd be asking me more about collections, Spring Boot features, database integration, and some of the core Java features, and maybe some scenarios of how I would achieve a specific goal. On top of that, when I was trying to figure out runtime issue when he said a couple minutes prior that we had 10 minutes left, he suggested to go and read the Java documentation for a specific feature for a hint before I finish. I told him that was kind of an unrealistic suggestion as I didn't have time to read the docs and then finish the rest of the problem all in only about 6 minutes. Unless there was some algorithm I wasn't thinking of, the kind of solution seems to be quadratic and insanely complex, and not code I was able to write in only 40 minutes.",

In my experience if both do well, expect around 5-10% (depends on company). If you do well but company doesnt expect around 2-5% (again depends on company). Companies with great benefits will always be on the higher end of that but if the company doesnt do well, expect drastic lows. One year nobody got raises because the company didnt do well.",

A phrase I've heard from some companies lately has been rather than adjusting to the cost of living, they are adjusting to the cost of labor. With all the layoffs, I believe total compensation has been dropping. Add to that some companies are doing poorly, you could argue the raises and promotions you've been receiving are a good thing, especially relative to the market. But a major factor is how your current company is performing. It feels like you're doing pretty well given the current market, but it's your right/decision to want more. I'd be pretty happy with that, though, especially if you enjoy your work.",

It’s not the right fit for everyone, but based on what you’ve shared, I think it could be a great match for you. Also, see if your employer might cover some of the cost; always worth asking.Speaking as someone also in cybersecurity, I don’t think a degree is strictly necessary solely because you already have work experience, but it can definitely help break through certain barriers, especially if the current job market trends continue. Plus, getting a solid foundation in computer science can open the door to more technical roles within cybersecurity down the line. Now if you solely want to learn the material, and don't also want degree there are dozens posts on self teaching CS and how to cover all the topics in a BS CS.",

Over half of them are out of work right now. For comparison, I usually get 4-7 callbacks per week. Maybe a 10-20% response rate. It's a REALLY fucked up market right now. Ai and layoffs mean every posting is flooded and they get a LOT of false positives. The most important thing is to be one of the first applicants so your resume actually gets seen. Sort by new first thing in the morning and apply to everything posted that day. Look for local companies who want you in office.

Was making 90k with potential of being at 6 figures in a year or two. work life balance was greatI went looking for a job and got one in FAANG. Base pay was an extra 30k but with bonuses and RSUS it was closer to an exrtr 70k for the next few years. It was alot of work and stressful. i worked in cloud which is known as the deat of work life balance, I just didnt realize how crazy it would be. There was a silent agreement to always be avaialbe. I was a mid-level and expected to do the work of a principal would do at other companies. If you dont paly their game they will PIP you within a year or two and fire you. Working 50-60 hours was the norm and even then it didnt feel like enough. Sometimes that extra 30% in pay means 100% more in work. Im glad im past that and made all the money I made but if I had known back then that my next 3 eyars was going to be like that I wouldnt have done it. At my first job I was in line for promotions and likely would've been a high level senior, but in FAANG I was far from promotion. People I knew who were overperformers were far from promotion.Im not saying this will happen to you but really make sure you this is something you can sustain and the expectation is reasonable. If you absolutelty need that extra 40k I say go for it but if you dont really need it, I say consider the options and find out if this will give you work life balance and career growth. Im all for grinding when young but you shouldnt have to drive yourself to the ground for it either.",

If you want a stable life and not have to worry about the anxiety of job searching you are in a perfect position to switch into healthcare. It is an industry where 1 application = 1 interview = 1 job, and there are no layoffs.CS is saturated and there are tens of thousands of more students graduating every year. It's going to get harder. Supply is increasing at an uncontrolled rate. I think you have an advantage as a young person because you are honestly assessing the situation for what it is. Many others are delusional and think they can just \"go cyber security\" like it is one easy trick to fix their career. You are honest that you want to have a good steady income - which puts you ahead of the crowd who rambles about \"passion\" and \"purpose\" while spamming random companies in desperation.",

Had pretty bad undergrad gpa from some earlier years (I left and returned to college 3 years later) at a really low ranked college, but still wanted to do my PhD at T50. I couldn't qualify for a lot of internships because of GPA requirements, but with a masters I could since it would just go off that GPA. I also wanted to work some a federal job. So doing my masters now at school T100 school with a 4.0 and currently in the interview process for a job with my dream federal agency where if I get I'll start at GS-7 (56k) and once I finish my masters I'll go to GS-9 (69k). The hiring manager actually seemed interested cause AI is designated as mission critical for the US government and my concentration for my masters is AI/ML. I guess with the lower pay and it being several hours from a large metro that it's harder to find young workers. Plus they said they'd help me get my PhD if I got the job which would put me at GS-11 for 84k.If it would actually be needed for the path you want to follow then go for it. But outside of a federal job pay boost or wanting to do research it may not help. Plus you sound like you dont want to do it.",

A MSCS without experience usually can only be considered as 1 yoe, so even if you ace all the interviews, the HC will question the decision.

Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.So I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.Niche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too. So now basically I have to maintain the knowledge of 4 stacks knowing that the amount of jobs I can apply to won't even compare to many of friends who have experience with only Java or Nodejs. For the current company, I've been more involved with the hiring process and the amount of Python/Ruby devs are still very few and far between. I guess the upside is that I know for sure I don't have to worry much about unemployment anymore. Take this as an anecdote, it might not applicable to your situation, nonetheless, good luck out there!",

Make your boss wonder why it is taking so long when he sees how clean and simple it is, a child could figure it out!... You'll discard so many bad ideas... You'll grow so much.Push yourself here....Make a staging environment, make a test env... learn to manage things with terraform etc.Take 24-48 hours before checking in, work on something else... and review your code.Use AI as a rubber duck.
