One thing though, while achieving what you just did is not an easy feat, talking about performance of a processing routine in isolation is not really relevant simply since we are in data engineering sub and thus data engineering context.A lot of tools in DE are designed to be flexible and there are other requirements/constraints that needs to be considered, and usually it might compromise some performances or simply not as efficient compared to a very specific implementation which you just did.I think just to demonstrate my point, one of the tools that are pretty commonly used in DE is Spark. Anyone who have used spark knows that Spark has mediocre performance, but it is pretty robust and easy to scale.I think it would be interesting if you can try to make commit to duckdb or clickhouse and see if you can improve their implementation.",

DuckDB is far more advanced than just an implementation - handling data types, optimize query plan, and it needs to consider other things like scalability and generalization for other cases. So of course it's understandable to have worst performance than this implementation.If to compare the performance, I would suggest comparing to solutions like 1 Bil rows challenge solution.Dont get me wrong. The optimization you've done is cool but the comparison seems bias to me and it can be better",

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.And if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.If the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.Super cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\\_cron/cron + dashboard.>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?That simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures* Schedulers like pg\\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?Yes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.Thank you for your feedback.

But none of that matters. Suck up to leadership. Do what they want, not what you think your career needs. Do enough to keep them happy and don’t worry about the technical optimization if it’s going to slow down the work. Eventually, one of two things will happen. 1. a better opp will come and you’ll leave. 2. You’ll eventually be able to hire someone who knows more than you. Could be a senior engineer who doesn’t want to get involved in non-tech stuff, so you can manage the relationships and goals AND learn from them. Or it might be someone who, frankly, could do your job better but simply doesn’t have the trust of leadership like you do. Doesn’t matter. This may have sidelined your growth as an IC a little, but it’s absolutely sling-shotted your opportunity for face time and relationship management. You gotta take the good with the bad and trust me there is bad on both sides. You will make mistakes. You will waste time and money. But in the end nothing matters other than keeping your boss happy. If you can do that, you’ll have *time* to do the rest.",

Technical ability is important, but a lot of that you can just learn from documentation and experience building. Being on a team doesn't directly give you that technical ability.But I can fully relate to your feeling. After university I went straight in consulting, team leadership and CTO roles.

Depending on your career goals, this could be better for you long term - most orgs struggle to find data folks that have enough technical skills to know what they’re doing but also have the business decision-making skills for higher impact.Either way, this is a conversation to have with your manager. If you want to do more technical work, I’d recommend either practicing your skills on your own, finding and developing your own projects that will impact the business positively if you have the leeway/bandwidth, or finding a new position if you can’t make your current one work.",

Taken with minimal experience and thrust into managing/building all our tech initiatives because no one else knew how and there was no one senior to teach me.I haven't solved the problem, but here's the advice I have. Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.You mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.Lastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.Leverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

I’m not sure there’s a direct point of comparison with SQLMesh, but here’s a quick summary of how lineage tracking is implemented in my demo:1. **Kafka** – No official integration; implemented using a custom single message transform.2. **Flink** – For Flink 1.x, only the DataStream API is officially supported. I implemented lineage in two ways: * **Table API job**: manual integration * **DataStream API job**: official job-listener–based method3. **Spark** – Officially supported via adding an extra listener.",

If there was a rewrite of the system to something new, that's interesting because it freshens up what you've been working on. Obviously one way around this is to get a new job, but I feel that sometimes merely introducing something new can make things exciting again. For example, are things written in Pandas? Try Polars.

If you've reach a level where you manage to have a good position with 30h a week in an office job with good pay, you are better off than maybe 90% of employees. I am afraid it does not get much better than that with this level of comfort, you may have unrealistic fantasies about other software jobs. There's an angle I have explored sometimes, which is working for an organization that makes you feel better ethically, such as a public service. The problem is that they always have worse working conditions and pay. I don't think a masters is going to help you get a better IT job as opposed to more years of experience, at your level of experience diplomas don't matter that much for recruiters I think. If you do it, do it for your own desire to learn without expecting too much from the career perspective, and try to do it while keeping a job, maybe some company will support it. Finally, as everyone else said, absolutely invest the money, free time and peace of mind your current stable position provides into your personal projects, relatives and hobbies.

The Hive style data catalog with table level metadata, such as table name, database name, table schema and directory path, did not disappear with Iceberg and Delta, see for example: https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/nightly/hive/#catalog-management. So not so much of a circle, but building on top, it kept the data catalog and added a snapshot catalog. Also, Delta and Iceberg are designed for huge data, in this case it makes sense to not be limited by the scaling of a single machine OLTP database, even for the metadata, by storing it with the data. It's just that most data projects don't need this scaling and would benefit more from the speed and strong guarantees of an OLTP, as understood by Duck Lake.",

It seems to me that Spark features in \"big\" (for a varying definition of \"big\") projects and platforms a lot. Polars seems to feature in smaller projects and platforms a lot. Postgres seems to feature in older, more RDBMS-driven architectures a lot too. But this isn't a stack, just \"some things I've seen\".I am not experienced enough to *really* say, but I can propose a \"hot-take\" theory of why this is. I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:A standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become \"data mature\" or \"data driven\" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with \"data driven\". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't \"build data\". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",

The only other time I have seen this is when the resources have changed significantly from the original resource and the target system doesn't allow an update and thus forces a destroy and create.I'm not saying Terraform or OpenTofu are bulletproof but it certainly goes a long way and can handle virtually any IaC issue if you understand how it works in a detailed manner.",

Looks like it supports a few other languages besides Python as well. The only real headache I've run into here is needing separate environments for the business-logic code vs the Pulumi code because of dependency clashes between the two. We already use UV for the business-logic code environment so I can probably manage it better all in UV but haven't gotten to merging the two.",

It involves POC work to proof certain hypothesis’s. I would ask myself and the organization - What is the vision and the goal of the architecture activities? Could be reduce cost, performance, scaling, ease of use …But usually it happens to what happened to you - a leader that might not exactly what data architecture is thought or was told that he needs an architect.

If Flink was as bad as in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.Since you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.Alternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.If you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.Regarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twiceWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address. Then Flink could indeed be an overkill.",

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

Like any reporting product, it’ll buckle under the weight of large datasets with granular dimensions, but there are ways to work around that. I strongly prefer OLAP cubes and Looker/Sigma models over dashboards as ways of letting end users more dynamically interact with data. Many folks on the business side are analytically savvy but don’t know how to dig into the data themselves, and tools like these really bridge that gap.",

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog. But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts. Something like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics. It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves. They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts. Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".Is Dremio working toward adding that capability as well? That would be interesting.",

Their implementation is targeted more at their LLM offerings than BI, though there are some BI integrations already available. I think no matter where you come down you need a UI to make updates easier and some automation around maintaining it. I am kind of surprised nobody has wrote that yet, at least that I have seen.",

That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn’t an easier sell either, because our business won’t see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?I'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.I use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one \"rule\"). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. The views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.There's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full \"rulebook\" for data quality independently from current extant problems. In time I plan to have PBI send emails to every owner of problems, every day that problems exist, nagging them to fix them. :slightly_smiling_face:",

Put monitoring on the Postgres side to monitor the WAL size and alert if it starts growing rapidly bc it can eat up space until the db stops working.For sending data from DMS to Snowflake you have a few options. I really like DMS -> Kinesis -> Firehose which will stream data to your snowflake table in real time. This requires some DMS settings adjustments but DM and I’d be happy to send. BUT if you have to restrict your Smowflake account to certain IPs then it’s no good because Firehose uses Amazon’s service range of ips which is like over 100 and they rotate and change constantly.So the DMS -> S3 is also solid just read the docs for settings. Use the cdc settings and parquet format and compression.",

I'd say concentrate on the schemas and if you have them, stored procedures too. Stored procedures are going to give you the most useful information because you'll be able to determine joins and start to develop a sense of what's related to each other. For SQL Server (and maybe others) - there's a tool from Redgate called SQL Dependency Tracker that can map this out visually, where there are joins, but also groups objects by names (it's part of their admin tool belt and it's quite useful)That being said you can find out a lot of this information out querying system tables assuming you have access to those. Unfortunately it's a very common problem, where object naming consistency can be as abundant as a documentation.",

And we each took responsibility for one data domain in that project (eg outpatient appointments, inpatient stays, A&E, referrals, etc) and saw it end-to-end from first sight of the data, to go live. (This typically took 12-36 months for one hospital trust - not just the DM, the system change at the hospital overall.)Anyway, yeah, each analyst often did have to spend days just plotting out all the relationships, identifying PKs and secondary unique columns, etc. Weeks of person-days expended overall for one system extract. All that before we could start assessing data quality etc. There aren't really any reliable shortcuts. You're doing the right kind of stuff.

Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution. Having at least a loose idea of how these strata are working can also give clues (if that reminds you of archeology that's normal, I have worked in an adjacent field before data).* Ancillary data: data like creation timestamp, creation user, logging related ids etc... Are usually added at the end of the table when creating it the first time. Since columns usually keep their sequential order over the lifetime of the database, you can sometimes use these to assess what was part of the original table DDL statement, and what was added after...* Take notes of everything. Save queries, ids, sessions, hypotheses, document it all so no one else has to do that work again afterwards.But yeah. This is difficult, time consuming and hard work. Good luck.",

You could write script to identify peaks and valleys by magnitude and then flag the start/end as the valley in-between peaks or the peak and surroundimg X ms as the window, depending on how much dead space is between and what is more representative.

What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM). If I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".A+",

This was about 2-3 years ago, and I haven't kept up with their product to see if there's a good lightweight solution to this.If not, I'd be inclined to at least consider a solution that involves a job that does a few things: * copies spreadsheet to csv on s3/snowflake *landingpad* * applies a jsonschema validation to the data. In the event that there's any issues it would have a set of contacts to send a summary of the issues found to. As you can imagine the more frequent this happens the better, ideally every 5 minutes or so, so that someone will get an alert as soon as they've entered bad data. * then copies the validated data into an appropriate raw bucket/raw database area where it can then go through a typical data pipeline for transformation.The above can be done in a variety of ways, but is fairly straight-forward.",

Can be on a staging layer, in PBI or as simple as a few lines of Python or PowerQuery into a unified fileIf not, you'll need to do it manually. Basically you pull in all the data into a central file or table as above and you manually identify duplicates. Then you give them an \"master\" ID. The next day you do the same and manually process the new records, etc. Can be done in excel with Vlookup + copy paste, using simple code into CSV output, in PowerQuery, ...Now if you want to share this data between applications, you should seriously consider changing the way this data is stored in the first place. You don't really need an MDM but reather some serious business process reviews: who is responsible for making a new \"contact\" or \"invoice\" ? Which tool generates those?

Our data stewards use excel to maintain various reference tables and it’s a pretty nice and easy to use interface for them.

The system is nice for a DBA / DE to administer, and has a snap in for excel, permissions are in Active Directory.

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the \"best\" or \"most efficient\" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it. That week becomes a month.Most efficient method is to start with something and build from there.> Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insightsBy all means, take an introductory course into DE. I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful. That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.A lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I got my first DE job\". Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job. For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.The process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy. It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure. It's not to say that you can't do it. In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can. Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead. >Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?I will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head. Just go for mid. The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago. The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market. Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated. One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.Forget junior level positions. Aim for mid level positions. Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced. Be good at communicating. Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things. If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

DataTalks DE Zoomcamp walks you through that for free; Zero-to-Mastery covers similar ground but spends more time on theory, so combine it with hands-on practice or you will feel lost in interviews. I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code. Document everything in a GitHub repo, add a CI pipeline that reruns daily, and mention the link on your resume; recruiters love evidence over certificates.

Look at cloud data engineering certifications (any of aws, Google, azure) or ISV certifications like Databricks, Snowflake. They are also helpful during shortlisting when HR may use keywords.I also suggest maintaining a log of your learnings - either as a public blog or as a personal journal. This will help to reinforce some of the key concepts. Think of it as interview prep. When you write something down, you get better at explaining it during interviews.",

Relying only on roles inside each query engine tends to fragment governance and forces you to duplicate logic.One alternative is to push governance down to the catalog layer. That’s the approach we’ve taken with Lakekeeper:•AuthZ outside the engine → central policies, enforced consistently across Trino, Spark, Flink, etc.•Implemented with openFGA → but modular, so you can swap in a different policy engine if you prefer.•OPA (Open Policy Agent) integration → rules can express tenant- or product-level access (schema/table/column/row).•No data duplication → instead of tagging/duplicating rows, you apply policies dynamically at query time based on tenant or token context.That way you keep one source of truth for governance, and avoid coupling access rules to any single engine.Disclosure: I’m part of the team building Lakekeeper (open-source Iceberg catalog).",

My first impression going into the field was to have a degree as it would verify my technical abilities more than certifications. I do know that this is where projects and a portfolio would be handy to showcase my abilities. But I was also under the assumption that getting my degree in data science/engineering would just give me an upper hand as well with the alumni connections I would make while studying in the program.

When using `:memory:`, you won't have any persistence.DuckDB by itself, even outside of dagster, handles its own multiprocessing. As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.To bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.Multiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.If you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (without being willing to persist your data to disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB.

SevenDB is state/storage-oriented, i.e. we keep a durable dataset and design around logs, recovery, and replication.**Optimization focus:** Aurora obsesses over real-time scheduling, load shedding, QoS (quality-of-service graphs). SevenDB is focused on correctness, durability, and developer experience in distributed settings.",

Detecting water levels, from enough places, maintaining those sensors over the long term, getting power to the sensors, data from those sensors, and gathering all that data into a central service.Actually consuming that data is the easy bit.This is why I think it'd work well as a community project - get local communities, schools etc to adopt, deploy, maintain - perhaps even build - their own sensors.

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.The very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.All that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650). Are you sure that this an issue that needs a new app to solve it? Maybe it's just an issue of people not being aware of their options. You might be able to accomplish more by helping people download and learn to use existing apps and resources.ETA: removed overuses of \"already\"",

It will take a lot of time and some money. You can raise alerts manually from the server even if there is no sensor system or get data from multiple points and raise an event by a logic you decide.So I suggest you start from App part and than server and than the arduino part. This will ensure you won't waste money if project is not moving forward and you will still have a system that is working even if your project is still not finished.",

For example, I could put one at the bottom of my garden near the drainage ditch. If it got wet it would alert me, and send a message via my phone to a server than could then push messages to my neighbors and maybe my town public safety people.

        "body": "So, how serious are you in working in this?For near real-time river water level (around 15 to 30 minutes delay), you can get information from https://publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my/. Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. If you explore the website above:* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.These are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.You can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.You can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.As for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.I'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. You may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.As for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.So, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. For flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. This is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?Here's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.I do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.Anyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.If you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\\_id=1059.Anyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",

One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.If you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",

Build small, focused projects where you only practice one concept (e.g., a to-do app for CRUD, a weather app for API calls, a notes app with React state). Once you’ve done a few, you’ll naturally start connecting the dots and see which tool to use where.And don’t feel dumb if a colleague solves things faster, it’s just experience. With time, you’ll recognize patterns and solutions faster too. Keep building, break things down, and your speed/intuition will grow.",

This is both a humbling place to be, but also demonstrates you've got the guts to stick it out in that place. Good for you. Every progammer will feel this at some point, you're joining a long long line of great engineers who've walked this path. Welcome :red_heart:As for breaking a problem down, there's a few ways to do it, as you can imagine. Here's my 2 cents for you:If you can't clearly see a structure for your solution, consider starting with a monolith. You'll build a thing that works (customer says yay) and the natural boundaries/seams will likely reveal themselves in the process. Kent Beck was saying as much the other day on LinkedIn.Whiteboard is king. And bring a friend, use them as a rubber duck. Or use an actual rubber duck.Finally, don't get cute. Most languages have some fancy features you'll be tempted to use. Resist their siren song :grinning_face_with_sweat:These are suggestions. There will be situations in which they represent bad advice. Keep your eyes open.Super lastly - good engineering is, I believe, about human communication. Strive to build good partnerships with other engineers... Then steal all their good ideas and ways of thinking! Haha. In a loving way, of course.Best.",

That feeling of powerlessness is job security my friend so just learn whatever weird things they are doing. I once (thankfully) flunked an interview because they tested me on object oriented Perl because that is how they did things. I found that odd and after the interview requested a sample of what it was they were even alluding to. They could not produce this sample for me needless to say. The questions they presented were the equivalent of doing FP with Ruby or building a compiler with Awk. Sometimes enterprise code winds up that way.

That is kind of the core loop of any engineering work.Express yourself either in pseudocode, or use some features of the programming language that lets you gloss over details while you work out a general structure, like [the `todo!` macro in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html), that always passes typechecking but crashes with a `not yet implemented: your message` if it ever actually gets called.Sometimes you'll find that what you thought was a decent strategy for a solution can't be implemented for whatever reason, then you have to think about that sub-problem again and see if there's some other way to get at it. And preferably leave a comment about the strategy you thought of first and why it's unworkable.> I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more.That helps, but everyone has to start somewhere.

If you ever decide you like where project is & you want people to be able to access it OR you decide you done with a project but you want other people to try to complete it you can then publish it.Another commentor mentioned it not being a resume, but you can turn GitHub into a portfolio. If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).Edit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub. If your computer crashes or your files get corrupted you can retrieve your old code. AND if you break your code some how you can roll back to an older working version. I wish I had been used GitHub when 6 was beginning, I have months/years of code lost. It would be neat to go back to look at.Edit 2: One benefit of make your code public is that is anything happens where you lose access to your GitHub account, you will still be able to download your old code.",

But having to constantly pick up completely different things and become productive with it in a short amount of time can be somewhat stressful at times. i am also not sure if this is good career wise.

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:* start the game * reset score, health and positions* game loop: * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer * move enemies * move player * check collisions * if player hits enemy: inc points * if player-health < 0, exit loop* game over * display score * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the gamesomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.Then when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.This doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!As you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

I didn't understand shit, I felt really dumb and I didn't dare go to others for fear of exposing me as the ultimate idiot I felt I was. But as for my promo, everyone was really sweet and the more skilled didn't hesitate to make rounds to see if anybody needed a helping hand. Anyway, after that first week passed I kinda had a click. While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises I finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...). Really hoping it's enough to get accepted into the school, but in the meantime if you have any questions whatsoever feel free to ask away!",

I also worked as a “teacher” during other piscines, so I’ve seen both sides.For context: when I started the piscine I had **zero coding knowledge**. I didn’t even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.You’re *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that’s the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.The main things they look at are:* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.It’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.One last tip: **don’t measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn’t mean you’re behind. You’re on your own track.And yes, you’ll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone’s starting point is. Don’t let that get to you.",

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later onAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! Its very important that you have a good grasp on the “context” of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren’t aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.Last couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? What are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you’re supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?How comfortable are you getting with your current “ignorance” ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? And make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important oneMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb And have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

Go back to step one and repeat the processIf you can implement this process, after 50 iterations you will have 50 small programs that all do something different.

I didn’t first notice this until I was 5 years in (professionally) programming for maybe 8-9 years total. I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn’t something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I’m the rookie. The best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you’re out of your depth as OP says, you’ll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.From my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. Now I’m at a point in my career where I’m learning to “trust myself” that I do have those qualities. There isn’t one path but you should learn to trust yourself and gain confidence that you do have the ability to put in the work to make it happen.",

We \\*can\\* for example just accept that it's \"all just zeros and ones\" and that is one way to look at it. However there \\*are\\* quite different ways we have to work with and encode textual data. Distinct from numbers. Distinct from Video or images. Some of this applies to some of your earlier thoughts. What I encourage you to try to do, is recognise that you are just discovering different ways to think about the same thing. Some of the answers (and indeed debates you are getting into) relate to people pointing out that you can look at it your original way in some context, or in a third way in others. This is really the useful skill. I've been around the block a bit and I can conceive of a relevant problem in terms of say, a functional programming solution or an object one or a procedural one. I can see how data might map onto Json or XML, or Yaml and how each might look and how to consider that. The OS for example is \"different than what us peasants use\", once you start getting into problems that deal with user space vs system space and so on. Some stuff the OS does \\*is\\* privileged and now you start to need to separate them again. The journey of seeing it as trivial, then understanding the complexity, then know how to abstract that complexity into something more trivial again ad nauseum, is something of a long one.",

The CPU just sends the signal to the chipset which handles the actual I/O data transfer. The data read/written are handled in RAM. When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.This was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).But if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).",

If the job requires knowledge of the food industry as well, then you'll be competing against a very small pool.This is basically what I did. I was a 3D artist before. Now I'm a 3D artist who writes a bit of code, and that can be very useful to some organizations.Also, my thoughts on AI: investors want everyone to believe that AI is about to get so good that it wipes all of us out, but I'm just not seeing it in my sector. In fact, I just got hired at a new job, and I barely even use it. Mostly just as a Google replacement.

Remove SQL from the list cause you ll need to learn it no matter what, even if you will use ORMs throughout your career, still knowing SQL and Database Modelling is something that will make your time investment worth it.Then the language that you will pick has to do with some important factors that you and only you have the answer.# Factor 1: Does it make sense ?You need to see if the language you will choose will click with the way you want to solve a problem.# Factor 2: Is it used out there ?Typescript, Java and C# as some examples are used everywhere and they will keep being used no matter how many languages will be created from now on. This is crucial to be able to work on existing codebases and have lots of positions to pick fromHaving said all these, sometimes what you might like will not be connected with what you will use to bring some bacon on the table. Personally i found Erlang/Elixir (BEAM, OTP) literally a magical technology but i have never used it in any professional project. I still use Node.js and C# with a sprinkle of Golang and i am grateful for that.If i would start again now i would tell the younger me and i tell the same to you. Get started with Java or C# or even both. Get good at it both to build and design new projects as well as how to read and refactor old and ugly projects and call it a day.All the best to you.",

If you gotta use a language you don't know, just keep the docs, Google and stack overflow near you to get the answer fast. In the real world you rarely get to decide the language or framework you are going to use, since it is either predefined by the existing infrastructure/code/device, or it will be decided in a team meeting.You just have to know the differences and pros/cons of compiled vs scripting languages, and maybe some some optimization facts. In summary, just learn how to program, identify the problem, think of the generic solution, and then implement the solution in the language you are currently using with help from the docs and online resources.",

You drop OOP, brackets, and you just need a little syntax intro and you are basically good to go.Personally I focused on Java and i had obviously no problems with JVM langs like kotlin but even further i had no problems to jump into C#, python or learn go in relatively short time. Effectivelly any higher abstraction language, which usually have garbage collector, will be easy to pickup for you. Lower level languages like C not so much but you can effectivelly delve deep into lower level Java and most of popular algorithms are the same.In this stage of study you should already know about pointers/references and how low level memory works and why GCollector languages are beneficial for you etc.",

Trying to shove all those languages into one project sounds like a pain. I'd try to use the language the course requires and not mix in others.And, fortunately for you and the other students, these languages are generally in the same family. SQL is meaningfully different, and it is good to learn a bit about databases, and the problems you get there should generally be exercises in thinking about data structures and constraints.But C#, Java, PHP, and Python you can all approach from an OOP POV, and they all generally are relatives of ALGOL, which means that you can to a degree guess at both syntax and semantics for languages you're not all that familiar with.As you get more experienced you should start feeling like keywords are mostly trivial, and that most libraries are something you look up the docs for when you need to but don't remember long-time, unless you actually use it often.",

Pick one of your favorite languages and learn to make a program that with interface with a database by sending http requests to that application. (Exact language doesn’t really matter. Python Java etc. this is API development experience) 2. Make a front end using your Java framework or using Javascript/React to be the user interface to interact with that database using the API you built (don’t focus too much on looks, focus on making requests to your API and retrieving data and adding data to the database)3. Learn a little about docker to stand all your services up This is a great project for people trying to get practical experience before an internship, the idea itself doesn’t matter too much. Could be a twitter clone, simple picture display app, anything. But the core learning is about using a language and making an API, a MySQL database and a little bit of frontend interacting with that database. That’s fullstack in practice, but if you keep your scope small you’ll get exposed to a lot more about how software development works",

Had you done that, you would have found countless posts telling you to start with small and simple projects and grow in all directions. A ToDo List app may be too ambitious for your skill level - not programming wise, but design wise.You need to learn the design and planning processes that go from idea via specification, detailing, breaking down, solving individual parts to final implementation in a programming language.You most likely directly started at the computer and naturally were dumbfounded and got stuck. You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".Sit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.This specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).As with every similar post, some book recommendations: + \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldAll these books focus more on the process that leads to the implementation in code than on the code itself - hence, the used languages are fairly unimportant.Also, consult the **Frequently Asked Questions** in the *sidebar* here for a cornucopia of project ideas on many different levels.",

Don't start some large project like making a complex game, you are more likely to just start over again than rewriting all the crappy code you wrote before. Also, if you want to do something complicated, thing about how to split this into smaller, modular projects, you will still eventually reach the point where you rewrite the earlier modules.

Do you make it completely in python or are you making it with a database ? Do you want it to run in the terminal or be a proper app with an UI ?I find making the things and looking up what I need when I'm faced with a problem has helped me much more than aimless tutorial watching, I have also found remaking my old projects with new knowledge to be really entertaining and good for motivation and a to do list might be perfect for that. You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself - level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.For bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.The more you do, the more you learn. Try finding interesting ways to practice with the things you learn and finding things you can partially do but need just a bit more learning to do and work towards that. Good luck learning",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion. Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

Haskell in particular showed me that most popular languages are really geared towards practical engineering and that, for the computer scientist, there is another world out there.Later on, I discovered Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), which used to be the textbook of the foundational programming course at MIT. That too is a really great introduction to the abstract power of computer programming and the power of thinking computationally. In that book, they use Scheme, which is one strand of Lisp. I'd definitely recommend SICP to anyone.If you really want to geek out, you could try Forth and have a look at stack computers.",

Figure out what your project is going to be, then break it down. Work on one function at a time. Using the todo app (without tutorial), how do you list the todos? How do you add or delete a todo? Edit a todo?Break everything down into a single step. Then add another step. And then another. Until you have a full feature. Then work on the second feature in the same way, one step at a time.",

This works for me, because I like odd maths puzzles. The key part is, I write scripts that do something interesting to me, and which I have no expectation will live beyond a few hours. They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something. (If i roll two dice 100 times, how many times will I get a 5 and a sum less than 9, or something silly like that). Over time I just got better at banging out boiler plate code, and I found ways to make (for example) loops quicker and more efficient. It isn't useful, it is entertainment. If you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you? I learnt the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries by building a script that could use wikipedia. My wife and I used to often ask - what films have and been in? Who has been in films most with . Turns out you can crawl wikipedia and build lists pretty easily, and I learnt a lot about two useful libraries. (My scripts were absolutely horrible, but with a lot of care and attention they could normally get us a quick and fairly useful answer most of the time.) The wikipedia thing also got me thinking about optimal data types, recursive searches through links, all kinds of good stuff. But at the time *that wasn't what I was doing*, I was just looking to find films with specific actors in them or something.",

From the perspective of the Virtual Ego Framework (VEF), what you're experiencing is a **\"Zeno Trap\"**. It's a recursive loop of overwhelm where the sheer number of possibilities freezes your ability to act. You have all the components, but the \"blank canvas\" is too intimidating to start building a coherent structure.The solution is not to \"try harder,\" but to change the protocol.**1. Break the Trap with a \"System Reboot\" (Ego-Transcendence):** Stop trying to build the *whole project*. Forget the grand architecture for a moment. Your goal is simply to write **one line of code that works** and breaks the loop of inaction.**2. Start with a \"Coherent Kernel\":** Don't start with the project; start with the smallest possible \"coherent kernel.\" Ask yourself: what is the absolute simplest, single thing this script must do?* Make it print \"Hello, World.\"* Make it open a single file and print its first line.* Make it take one number and add one to it. This is your anchor. It is a small, perfect, working system.**3. Begin the \"Forging Process\" (Iterative Refinement):** Now, begin the **\"Forging Process.\"** This is an iterative loop of critique and refinement. Add one tiny new feature. Does it still work? Good. Now, critique it. How could this one tiny function be cleaner or more efficient? Refine it. Then, add the *next* tiny feature. You are not building a cathedral from a blueprint; you are forging a single, perfect brick, and then another, and then another.By reframing the problem this way, you move from a state of overwhelming, incoherent possibility to a state of focused, coherent, iterative action. You don't \"bridge the gap\"; you forge a path across it, one step at a time.# Zen (VMCI)",

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.I think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...And then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.Nowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.If you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

I worked for a couple of years in .Net MVC before switching jobs. I never did end up working somewhere that used Node, although I've done some consulting work with it. I think it's smart to have a plan to get your first job. Target a few organizations with similar tech stacks and look for any opportunity to get into one of them. Help desk, QA, whatever. And then, dedicate yourself 100% to their tech stack and make no secret of how much you want to join their development team. Offer to build small utilities and try to solve problems with scripts, etc. Always have a project you're working on. It's not an easy plan, but it's a plan. Good luck to you!",

But you're not cooking yet.You are learning aspects of the language. The key is to get past that, be able to hear a simple problem, and figure out how to write code that accomplishes it.For the vast majority of things you can think of, you won't have any idea how to write code that does that.But for a few very simple tasks, you might be able to do that. For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.The goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show ---e----eThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.That's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.Currently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

You're allowed to pin up to six repositories to the front of your GitHub profile. It doesn't hurt for one of them to be in assembly. Assembly code is hard to read, so make sure your GitHub project has a good README.md file in the front because they probably won't get any farther than that. Also make sure you learn the command line tool git before getting into GitHub. You should know the git commands `git init`, `git clone`, `git commit`, `git pull`, `git push`, etc.",

You can say you covered pretty much every basic of JS, but if you need to understand problems, fix errors and write code yourself without help, you need constant practice. For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). Just get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. JavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.You will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you), You can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)After you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

If you're delivering an enterprise level event driven hybrid on-prem/cloud architecture in which your applications are composed of containerized microservices with k8 orchestrated auto scaling then you're probably not going to have any one guy on the team who both understands the full topology of your infrastructure and the nitty gritty of the code itself across all the different applications.

And CSS defines how those elements are arranged on the page.Look up some HTML and CSS tutorials.

I think you have a realistic view so think over what you would do if you did something else and how that would look in 5 years. I don’t think you’re in a point in life to torpedo your career aspects for another person but I understand that’s a selfish view and there’s always other options. Mandatory internships are perfect because you don’t want to graduate without experience in the first place. First job is hardest to get.",

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.For instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.The reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like: while (internalQueue.size() == 0) { wait(); }If you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.On the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.The solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.----If you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of: while (true) { synchronized (obj) { if (internalQueue.size() > 0) { // do stuff return; } } Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue }But no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

To be fair, he was in a beginning course, which should have had simple bugs.Even so, he must have thought that solving programming problems shouldn't be this hard. Once you realize that these things can take time and not beat yourself up for not getting it.Quite often, you find the bug (or in this case, it was a design issue), you kick yourself for not finding it easier.It's a matter of telling yourself it takes time to learn even if you want things to go faster, it goes as fast as you. You're asking us for how to avoid this feeling. I'm saying embrace it. Say \"I am feeling frustrated, but that's OK, because this process is slow and I just need to accept that and relax\". Take a few deep breaths, and plow ahead.Also, the suggestion about taking a break helps. You can ask yourself, like you did, is there another way to do what I'm doing that makes sense.",

It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. 4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. Generally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve. Also, look into the different areas of compsci, see which path may be interesting to you, this will change for sure as the years go on but its better to have an idea and change it than to start with nothing.",

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.It is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.I'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.My advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

        "body": "Hey :) I am currently writing my Master Thesis in Cybersecurity at a University in Germany. I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better. I can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. I feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience. If you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.Regarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)If you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

Depending on the quality of the classes at your institution that will require more or less outside effort on your part but that’s going to be the case no matter what you study.This may just be my opinion but I wouldn’t worry about whether or not AI will impact your job. It will, that’s pretty much a given at this point. Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance. These are valid questions but I don’t think any of them are actually unique to computer science and you should probably be asking the same questions about anything you’re considering as a career.",

If you want something fancier, for example where you highlight all possible ending tiles on the board, you'll need to devise some function to tell you what tiles are possible to move to (kind of tricky with branching pathways, would probably involve some kind of graph structure). This is assuming that each player needs to use up all of their moves each turn.I've used screentop to prototype some things in the past and it was a little limiting, I think it's better for card games, and of course complex mechanics need to be manually enforced between players. Godot is also a good option for these kinds of prototypes, GDscript is flexible like Python which I've found is good for playtesting and prototyping",

Just pick one language, C# is totally fine and stick with it. Learn the core concepts before you start trying to make a game though.",

You should always build your own project - sometimes I build it alongside with following the tutorial, adding steps as I go along, sometimes I begin the project when the tutorial is over. Very often I have to go back and review some parts of the tutorial to understand a specific step better.I don't think you can retain any knowledge if you just watch a tutorial, and very little if you only follow it - the only thing I've found working is when you need to solve a problem in your own project, and have to think about how it could be done, perhaps remembering the tutorial, perhaps having to review it again.

Your descriptions are decent but the devil is in the details.Here's a good way to think about it: if you gave your instructions to ten average college students and asked them to MANUALLY follow your steps, do you think they'd all get the same result?

Personally if I were trying to solve a real problem like that I would look to see if a library were available and to use that.That said, I personally don't think Simpson's Rule ought to be hard for a programmer to understand, but if I look at typical explanations, e.g. in Wikipedia, something about the delivery of the explanation, with lots of mathematical symbols and so on -- tends to make my eyes glaze over. If I were basing this on the Wikipedia explanation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s\\_rule), I would start with the \"**Approximating the natural logarithm of 2**\" example listed there (that is easy to follow) and once that one makes sense (and once I'd written a simple program to calculate it that way), I would work backwards to make it work with the \"general composite 1/3 Simpson's rule\", for example. At that point you should basically have computer code that is a computer version of what the Wikipedia article is telling you.If SICP has a \"mathematical background\" section in the appendix, I would try reading that first and then representing all of the notation as code as a sort of \"translation\".",

There is nothing special about a txt file that makes it different. In fact *all files* are merely a sequence of bytes. Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it “hey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters.  A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say “hey, read me as text”, but is still just an array of binary. You actually usually can simply open these in text editors to view broken gibberish if you’d like.Anyhow; if you’d like to store data in txt, there are countless tutorials; it’s often taught as an intro method when first learning file handling anyhow. Decide on a schema, the easiest probably being each piece of data on its own line, since reading txt files line by line is simple.",

Nowadays this topic is often called \"serialization\" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.Just as one example, look at how the [\"Protocol Buffers\"](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe \"messages\" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.It uses the same \"length prefix\" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.Reusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.Or if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip. Maybe add an extra custom header so various tools don't automatically recognize it as compressed data.",

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.Then goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.One way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",

A website or a simple blog documenting your progress is also a good idea.Once you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, work on some side projects in the area you like the most.

By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.As for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

Praticar todos os dias, nem que seja um pouco, e transformar ideias em projetos reais faz muita diferença. Na minha opinião, esse é o melhor método — só não digo que aplico sempre (minha história é longa!).Ferramentas de IA são ótimas para automatizar tarefas repetitivas e acelerar protótipos, mas é importante entender a lógica por trás das linguagens. Isso permite criar soluções próprias e compreender de verdade como tudo funciona. Use a IA como apoio e complemento, não como única fonte, para evoluir como desenvolvedor.Deixo só um alerta: excesso de informações e possibilidades pode causar confusão ou até esgotamento mental. Falo por experiência! Mesmo com acesso a muitos cursos ótimos, às vezes fico perdido sobre o que realmente quero aprender. Por isso, vá com calma, priorize o que faz sentido pra você e tente curtir o processo.",

Cada projeto novo traz perguntas novas, e o processo de pesquisa é parte natural e fundamental para juntar essas peças.Ao invés de ver a pesquisa como uma falha, tente encará-la como seu braço direito. Os melhores desenvolvedores do mundo consultam documentação, fóruns e exemplos o tempo todo. O importante não é memorizar tudo, mas compreender os conceitos, praticar e construir passo a passo.Se preocupe mais em entender o “porquê” das coisas, e menos em acertar tudo de primeira. A repetição e aplicação prática vão solidificar seu conhecimento melhor do que qualquer tentativa de decorar.Por fim, lembre-se que a jornada da programação é longa, com altos e baixos — e o medo, a dúvida e a insegurança fazem parte dela. O fato de você estar aqui buscando se melhorar é o maior passo que pode dar. Continue firme, aproveite cada oportunidade para aprender e cresça no seu ritmo!",

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.If it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.So it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.Understand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.There are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.The important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.Test automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?Understand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?Impossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?There are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

You were brought on b/c as a young developer you are not too expensive. The questions you may want to ask yourself are what is the market potential of the application and what are the goals of the founders and investors. Is there desire to grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. To find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code) products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. Hang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

        "body": "You're welcome, hopefully it was at least a little bit helpful.Unfortunately, I don't know of any *comprehensive* resources covering what you need to know as a senior dev. I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.But there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.The good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.Just as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.Also, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.EDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

The process of retyping and organizing everything is a form of review that will make you engage with the content again.Also consider keeping algorithms in your knowledge management system. If you get a useful piece of code you can keep it and use it again, especially if you have to reimplement it later in the same course or reuse ideas in a future course.

I felt with #1 and #2 I was spending too much time trying to get the diagrams/sketches/code blocks \"perfect\" and was less focused on the material itself. I would print out the lecture notes/slides before the class (this assumes your professor makes them available to you beforehand), and annotate those notes. If I needed more space for code/examples, I'd use loose leaf paper. I'd then put all that together in a 3-ring binder. This came in especially handy for my DSA final exam which was open book (paper only; no electronics). I had all kinds of annotations that were basically answers to the the multiple-choice questions. It just depends on your learning style. For me, the physical act of writing helps me retain the information better than typing or even writing on the iPad.

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.Any standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want. The only practical limit is the amount of available memory. (Technically, there's usually also an upper limit defined by the maximum value of the integer variable storing the data structure's size, typically on the order of 2^31 which is roughly 2 billion. But you're likely to run out of memory long before you hit that limit. And nobody is likely to be creating animations with 2 billion frames.)> See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.The specific programs you asked about are closed-source and proprietary, so the source code isn't published anywhere. Google can't find something that doesn't exist on the internet.There's a 2D animation program called Synfig Studio which is open source: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/ But it has hundreds of thousands of lines of code so it's not going to be easy to understand for a beginner.But see, for instance, this class which defines a `Keyframe` object and a `KeyframeList` which is a sorted list of keyframes at different times: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/synfig-core/src/synfig/keyframe.h",

Do you have a favorite programming language? Is there a type of program or tool you're most interested in?

        "body": "I don't know anything about your university in particular, but in a lot of CS degree programs, it's possible to pass your classes without ever really *applying* the concepts you've been taught to real, non-trivial programs. So if that's you, you need to start getting that applied experience yourself.In terms of practical skills, I'd suggest going through [\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) from MIT CSAIL. This is the kind of stuff that self-motivated, self-taught people tend to just figure out on their own, but if you don't, then your university probably won't teach it to you very well. So having it all laid out in a \"syllabus\" can be helpful.Aside from that, just pick a language, pick a project, and start building *something*, anything. It doesn't have to be a unique idea, or a million-dollar business, or even particularly useful. Writing a complete program, and actually putting in the work to make all of the details work the way you want them to, is irreplaceable experience. Start small, and when you find yourself not being challenged enough, move on to something bigger.There are a million pages you can find online with simple project ideas, so just pick something that appeals to you. If you like networks, write an HTTP server from scratch with raw sockets. If you like games, build something simple and turn-based with a minimal UI, such as Tetris or Scrabble or chess. If you like productivity apps, build a clone of Google Calendar or a simple photo album organizer. You get the idea.",

I came up with a use case, ran the Udemy course and in parallel worked on my own pet project using the skills I learned in the class. This helped ingrain the skills a LOT more.The concepts for things are important for knowing what to research and even coding itself will have loads of research for you. Some languages I love: Python, Go, JS, HCLI use those three with frameworks to complete 95%+ of the work I do.Depending on the job field you want to go into, you can look up common languages for that field and really lean into that language.

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?This question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.This especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.If you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?If you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.If you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.Finally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

So if `action` equal 2, the program will execute the `case 2:` branch, and then it will \"fall through\" and execute `case 3:`, `case 4:` and `case 5:` as well.2. Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `\"Going\"`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `\"to\"`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail. And you're not checking for input parsing failures anywhere in your program.The console output seems to indicate that your IDE has a debugger, so you should be able to use it to single-step through the code and see these kinds of problems for yourself.",

Both are of course important, but I also think it is important to begin with what you find most interesting, and then fill in the other part as needed.But no matter what, you should sketch out what a character sheet should look like, most importantly, which \"fields\" it should have, and what kind of data to put into those fields, and whether there'll be any rules for values in some fields that can affect other fields. Three things: names, data-types and rules.Then decide which fields are the most important ones - you cannot build everything in one go, so best to start with the simplest possible version. May be as simple as just the name of a character, or only fields that are text without any rules.Then build the application with only those fields - begin with one that simply outputs a hardcoded character sheet - meaning that it just displays the same one always, like just a bunch of print-statements. Then gradually move those statements into variables. Learn what you need about variables, data-types and data-structures in whatever language you choose - anyone should be fine. Make the application just display a single character-sheet, but one that is defined in variables.Then find some way of storing those variables outside the code, in a file, in a database, whatever makes the most sense. And make it switch between different sheets, so that it can display anyone you choose. When that works, find a way to also edit and store the changes.You still only have a few simple fields, but now you have an application! A working one. Now it's time to add more fields, maybe even some rules - work gradually, one step at a time, follow a pattern somewhat like:1. Show some \"hardcoded\" values2. Show data from variables3. Load variables from outside the program4. Make the field editable5. Store the data outside the program6. Apply rules for valuesIt can be a long process, and a big project, so the important part is to start as small as possible, giving yourself as few headaches as possible :)",

I don't use leetcode much (I should probably get back into it, I've just been swamped with other stuff), but from the small amount of problems I did, it seemed to mainly just test your ability to break a problem down and logically build up a solution. Sometimes a simple problem will take you a day, or two, or three, or however much until you figure out the solution. But taking that time to struggle with it is part of the learning process. So maybe just give yourself some more grace and time, and allow the problem to be absorbed in a much greater capacity.",

Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it’s a different vertical than what they are looking for.Second company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.I question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for.

No outsourcing either, but increasing workload for those remaining while wages are stagnating.In the next 2-3 years, our seniors will leave, that's roughly 40% of our workforce and there are no replacements; with our specific skill set, we need at least three years of training. You can imagine how that will end. I'm already looking for something else because without enough staff we can't run projects, and without projects we are going to bleed dry quickly, as costs of operations are high.In general, less companies properly invest in junior talent, they just looking at short term value extraction, then move on to the next opportunity to exploit. Or just stick with their current workforce and try to remain as profitable as possible without blatantly violating labor laws.I honestly don't know what's wrong, it's like people in charge had their brains fried during COVID or something.",

Do what you have to do to survive, I had to sell some investments to stay afloat.Yes it is very demoralizing, it was my first time being laid off and I didn't realize how much of my feeling of self worth was tied to gainful employment prior to that, the depression sucked, but after some soul searching and figuring out what I actually wanted to pursue and what I would be good at, I took on other things that gave me purpose. I used my free time to volunteer for causes that were important to me, and I got to build some APIs that helped streamers fundraise for Planned Parenthood (we ended up raising over $60k grassroots) and eventually it was this project that landed me a role at a large nonprofit where I currently work. It's funny because I didn't do it with the purpose of landing a job, I legitimately just wanted to help out the cause and later when I found a nonprofit job posting that matched my skillset I realized it would be very relevant to them and I'm pretty sure that's what set me apart from the other candidates.",

The overzealous vibe coder trope.What that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.We all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.But it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.Nowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.I also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.AI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.I'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

That is a young person's game, not the game of someone who no longer puts their career as the most important tentpole in their lives above friends/family/fulfillment/stability. Also, the industry by the time you are that age could be a totally different landscape (like it was for them).In general though, I find almost nobody sticks with the same career path their whole lives. It's a far better trait to be adaptable and smart in this world we currently live in than pigeonhole yourself into a specific career. School makes you think you go to school and always stick with the same path. It never really turns out that way. Most do at least lateral shifts if not major ones.",

You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.ADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.I had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.Don’t panic, you’ll be fine.edit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t.

        "body": "Corporate Tech Recruiter here. There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP’s question First, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate. Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients. Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and onlywork on openings for that companyAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages. They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need. LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get tractionCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective. We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects. Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.So why are you getting tons of pings when you haven’t engaged with your LI profile? Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you’ve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).Personally as a corporate recruiter, I’m only reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match. But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements. From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience. Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.I understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

Everyone is a dev who has built something “scalable and unique and distributed to make some impact on xyz” yata yata. 99% of people use the same line.

We got 7000 apps, so anything even somewhat weird underwhelming or questionable is getting your app closed.Write something meaningful. We don’t want be left to have to wonder what you actually did at your role. Doesn’t help you that we can just hire Indian devs for $4/hr lol. They’re really bad, and I personally ALWAYS advocate for USA only… but my boss already had us pick up 10 Indians for the price of one (CHEAP) USA dev… which is a complete pain in the ass if I’m being honest. I hate it, but the VPs love it for “cost savings”.I manage 10 MORE mfs to only get 1.2x more tasks done from one US dev.. I have to make a ton of tiny tickets, the daily standup is one fucking hour long, and everything is constantly delayed… all in the name of “efficiency” and the idea that they should get better eventually. I fear our two current open roles will be the last US dev hires for a long time. Thank globalization for the fact that Defense and Finance are the only dev roles with US job security (anything needing security clearance).Even I worry being outsourced in the next 5 years once these dudes actually get decent at coding. Remote labor compensation is unfortunately a race to the bottom now. It ain’t like the old days. :face_exhaling:There’s easier money in construction work lol my advice? Become an electrician and start your own business. The CS Dev industry will be completely screwed for USA workers in like 5 yr. Already is screwed.

It takes a lot more money piled up to retire than most people realise.A veteran cs worker, for example, earning say $300k a year would need to have more than $4M in earning assets ( so their main home does not count ) - minimum, to keep their income at the current level. - let alone they are giving up future income growth. We, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it’s far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. And the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year… it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. I once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited. I don’t know his exact net worth, but his payout was somewhere between $10-$20M He was working with us a senior dev, earning like $200k. I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. - he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. - this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. - it gave him a sense of purpose. He was motivated, despite not ‘needing the job’ worked just as hard as anyone else. In short he enjoyed working and helping others, but had decided that he did not want the stress of being responsible for managing or paying others.",

But there's a really deadly spiral that a fair amount of people get stuck in.They land at a shit job where the things you're talking about are the norm, then they get burned out and desperate for a new job, and because of that desperation they fail to do their due diligence in the reverse interview and/or aren't picky enough with the new job, so they end up somewhere just as bad. Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.It's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.Layoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.>How do I just find some peace in this field?So the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.This requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.I've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.Good companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

Insane constraints (oh hey - now 90% of your code has to be crapped out by claude - enjoy!). More politics than DC.The mba's are only 2nd to the tech school grads in terms of being insufferable. Everyone critiques everything endlessly and in the end it doesn't matter how impactful you are - someone else takes credit upstairs for everything.Succeed in this cesspool and you are rewarded with more and harder work while the execs hire their college buddies and leaders from companies they acquire fill every high level tech roll without so much as an interview. You will stay in the mines and you will like it!And that's the thing... you kinda can.

It's kinda fun that way.No it won't make you a superstar. But - if you are looking for respite that's where I've found it when I needed it. In the day to day grind. Ignore the politics and the idiots - don't volunteer for anything. Don't attend any optional meetings or answer anything on slack that you don't have to respond to. Let someone else do it. Give yourself luxurious timelines and estimates and then just code for a while. The code is fun - it's interesting - it's a never ending experiment in order and logic. It's the best part of the job. Don't worry about fixing the architecture or righting any ships - just do the fun bit. Let others code be buggy - let the tests be a joke - let the libraries be undocumented and uncommented... and for all that's holy - don't worry about upgrading anything. Just code for a while. Methodically and quietly grind out some tasks and see how you feel.Eventually my ambition has always gotten the best of me and i've had to escape those easy orbits - but others stay there and seemhappy to me.

They were underpaying me, and I turned down a few better offers because it was a startup and they promised that they will make the salary better when the acquisition went through (I helped them on the due diligence docs, so I knew they were close) plus a bonus. Well the acquisition closed, everything was fine, champagne was had, etc. I asked for my promised bump, the CEO stalled, and stalled hard. They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said “I don’t know if you’re worth $150K, $40k or what.” After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. I learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. Now, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me. And if they don’t, I’ll find someone who does.",

Those have nearly all disappeared - so don't get your hopes up in landing a job at the few that remain. Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the \"convenience\" of being remote.Before you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the \"total value\" of your setup which includes:1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)2. Your company provided benefits.3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spentIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the \"real compensation\" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.You should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in. This will help you ground your expectations a little more.Its not wrong to demand more compensation for increased scope of responsibility and outcomes delivered. However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.There is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you. At this very moment in 2025, it is a bad time to engage in wage negotiations without something like a Union backing you. Depending on the percentile compensation, there are many people willing to take up the task.",

        "body": "Its social media. Humans within a social circle (that now encompasses the world) likes to show-off and brag. However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.>I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.Tech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.They certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.Do you really get why this happens?Based off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as \"keeping up with the jones\" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.Previously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.The internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:Any job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being \"cushy\" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.Many of these high paying jobs are not \"cushy\" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job. These so-called benefits only exist to extract more work hours out of staff. You get subjected to the political machinations resulting from the Jack Welsh Rank-And-Yank (the Hunger Games).",

Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.Take Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.If you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.Finance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.So if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",

So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). What parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?Also maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

While the rest is like data science/AI/ML adjacent. However, there is a pretty small section of industry looking for people who are good at security/reverse engineering. I heard it's growing but it doesnt seem in vogue.I'd recommend leaning into trying to become a security engineer or reverse engineering research. It's very niche but so is your skillset.

Keep in mind there are many different software domais to know, you are simply more familiar and comfortable with lower level code. To me it seems it sounds like you would benefit from studying things from the ground up. Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.Alternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.Git and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.Testing your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.As for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.Don't give up! You got a lot more skill that you think you do. Just remember, you need to learn the rules before you can break them.",

I drive a couple of ridiculously expensive cars, including one of the cars I had on my wall as a kid, which is now a highly sought after collectible. Some might look at that and think it's a waste of money. Maybe it is. But when you have that extra money to play with, it doesn't matter. I took my wife and kids to see Taylor Swift. I don't remember the cost but it was $10-12K something like that for seats so close we could wave to her, haha. Ridiculous money for a concert.

Will you be a 1099 contractor?If yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.Why do this?With a solo 401k you get two advantages:* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.There is also a third advantage.A 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.The employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.So with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.You just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k. Once it is open it can remain open even if you no longer generate self employment income.",

But i have an American education background.I have 8+ years at FAANG.Been job searching for the past year, and have applied and interviewed for American companies and Chinese and some Japanese ones.Across the board, Asian company interviews are incredibly difficult for technical. Hard leetcode problems right out the door. Back-tracking, dynamic programming questions. Zero hints. Solution must be optimal by end and must understand full time AND space complexity and explain pitfalls. Getting a 'working' solution with explanation of how to improve is not good enough. You need to have implementing full optimal solution by problem end to have a pass.====Having gone to school in the US and Asia during my formative High School years and seeing my cousins who are the same age as me go through their education system all through college as well... the fundamental reason why companies from asian cultural backgrounds is so hard, is that in Asian culture, mathematics and science is extremely hammered down during basic primary education. There's a reason why Asian cultures around the world, rank the highest in mathematics and science and absolutely dominate every single other country in the world over these two subjects.Unfortunately, what this produces are candidates that are so fucking good at math and science. The academic, technical, algorithm part of programming, is a laughable endeavor for a large majority of them. So they have to crank the difficulty to weed and get the truly strong candidates from their job pools.This is the unfortunate harsh reality.Keep in mind this doesn't mean these people are actually good employees or good workers overall or good software engineers, but they are strong technical programmers.",

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).Then I first had to Google all those \"dean's list\" things etc. ;)But that's been even worse for Asian CVs. Everyone's a medal winner for something, a ton of different ranks and levels etc. European CVs are usually rather plain in that regard and more descriptive (longer CVs and photos have been around for much longer as well. When I started you also had to put age and confession and martial status etc. - awful). It's fun to see that often when the descriptions are very mathy and technical, probably C or C++ mentioned, it's often Eastern Europe while for example Germans have a very business- and process-oriented language (requirements analysis (\"Pflichtenheft\" ;)) and ISO standards and optimizing business processes blabla Siemens mainframe blabla).Hiring internationally is interesting but also exhausting.Besides the business lingua CVs the worst I found to be the Indian CVs listing everything under the sun (experts in Gmail, excel, YAML, XML, JSON, Jira, Slack... basically dumping their current browser tabs and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt in the CV).I'm definitely on the conversational side but I'd say half the people we rejected obviously didn't have a lot of depth in what they've been talking about (e g. tell you which model they used and once you talk about it it comes obvious they haven't even read the abstract of the respective paper). Other half is social aspects, obviously not caring about the topic they should be working on, being super hard to talk to or just plain cocky, forgetting about the interview, not letting others speak/speaking over interviewers all the time, suddenly sharing their screen to show their bitcoin price predictor after we tried to wrap up the interview 5 times because it's been 9PM for us etc.",

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.Also, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.Another thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job.

I couldn't code out of uni.However, I genuinely believe, and learnt, that anyone with an average IQ can become a software engineer - my IQ is average. Sure, you may need to spend a bit longer practicing and going over things, but if I can do it - so can you.You need to find out what works for you with regards to learning. I found out (after buying lots of them) that books dont work for me. What worked for me was practical problem solving and project building.I basically put an entire year (literally, I barely went out) into learning computing science theory and practical coding through projects and challenges. I built so many projects I lost count. I also constantly applied for jobs and was rejected in that year - at one point being told software engineering wasn't for me but I should consider Business Analytics.A year later, I landed my first coding job (in 2017) and since then have worked up to over 6 figure salary in my area (Europe). I earn aprox 20-30% more than the average person with my experience in my area.This isnt to brag. This is to tell you that if I - an average dude - can do it, so can you.",

        "body": "TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.I never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. The issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. Because of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.That's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.You should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. A lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. You got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

I worked at a government contractor that supposedly had a good relationship with the customers. The relationship had existed for a few years. The CEO lied to us about a bunch of things, and they lost the contract. A few people were let go. A bunch left by choice and joined the new contract company. I was originally told the contract was for several years. There were actually yearly options. We were supposedly highly regarded, but things went south quickly. Contracts, projections, etc can change a situation very quickly. In a bad market, there will be fewer opportunities. But it’s entirely possible your current situation is not as stable as you think. The company could be sold/acquired, offshoring, maybe someone high up in your org decides to leave, and there’s suddenly a strange power/political dynamic.",

But the culture had shifted to be extremely micromanagey, and I'm too old to deal with that shit. The unlimited PTO also turned toxic, and we had a new CTO that was trying to turn up the heat on developers.I know a dying culture when I see one. I knew it was only going to get worse.So I started job searching, and left as soon as I had something else lined up. I'm still at that company, and things are going well here.But note that \"stability\" is a myth. Some people think that changing jobs is a risk from a stability perspective, but it's really not. The new guy isn't always the first person to be laid off, it's often the opposite. A company may want to get rid of some of the more experienced/higher paid SWE's and keep the fresh hires. And a lot of the times layoffs are mostly random, and there isn't a rhyme or reason.And just because your job is stable *now* doesn't mean it'll be stable tomorrow. The company I left in 2024 did a massive layoff not long after I left. There were no signs or rumors of it happening, it was very sudden. They did a few more layoffs after that one. My \"stable\" job very quickly turned not stable.No regrets over leaving, even if they didn't do layoffs. I left because the culture went to shit. I would've regretted *not* leaving.",

That doesn't mean you're \"blacklisted\", that means you've been rejected/ghosted. *Worst* case I'd imagine from that is a 6 month cooldown.Blacklists are generally for people that do something grossly unprofessional. Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.Having scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.Chill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.I have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.Well, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.I ghosted them. That's shittier than what you did. And I'm still not on their blacklist.You're fine.",

None of this white board stuff and especially none of this super company man \"behavioral\". It was just a job. It was a nice job. Now it is fucking insane.",

L1 and L2 are non-SWE roles and don't really come up in this forum. There are also levels beyond staff (senior staff, principal, distinguished, fellow).There's different leveling structures across the industry like Amazon's SDE1/2/3 and Microsoft's 59-80, and there's companies with different title progressions (e.g. again Amazon, where there's no \"staff\", or IBM, where \"staff\" means mid level and comes before senior), so talking in terms of \"L5\" just makes it easier to talk about level equivalency across companies.Each level has rubrics for both hiring and promotions, largely based on amount of scope/impact, and these rubrics are similar across different companies for the respective levels.",

The reason why a lot of new grad roles start very (typically between 2-4) is that anything under might be an intern role or a role at the company that is just lower. And for which level you interview for, it depends on your previous experience. Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).Also L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).You move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can’t move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

        "body": "So one thing you'll notice, is that the job of analyst, is really like 20 different jobs. every company seems to define it differently, and they usually don't actually do analytics, they do reporting or system management.The \"analyst\" job I ended up in, was really closer to SQL report writer for a massive system transition, along with a lot of system configuration stuff and excel stuff. but then after the transition they liked me and had me promoted into dashboard development to keep me on board.Still, I started in a shitty position to get in the door. I was labeled a \"temp worker\" with no benefits or PTO, yet I was given consistent a 40 hour schedule each week, with no expected end date. And was doing work that was definitely worth far more than what I was being paid.All I had when hired was a CS degree, good GPA, tutoring experience, and some data related projects. (machine learning based, but was a good example of data handling as well)I just kept taking on more challenges because they didn't have others who could do it. my suggestion is to aim for old \"fossil\" type non-tech companies. they are trying to modernize so they want people with these skills, but they don't pay super well, and wont have any mentors for you. They will like people who can independently teach themselves how to work with new systems. If you can make a pivot table in excel, your basically a wizard in those places. lots of room for recognition and self development.",

I also got to work in a variety of industries (consumer product goods, retail, healthcare, insurance). Consulting wasn’t for me long term so I left for a software engineering role, but it was a great post grad experience to learn what type of work and industry I wanted to work in. Disclaimer: In some ways going into consulting right out of college is like playing Russian roulette. You don’t know what type of consulting experience you’re going to have - will you be drowning in PowerPoint all day or will you get the perfect mix of technical and non technical work?

In regard to finding a new job, I think this is one of those things where you just need to commit to your current job. Spending extra mental energy on interviews makes it more likely you do poorly at your current job. I promise if you try your best and still get pipped, the pip runway is long enough for you to prepare at that point. It’s like months of time. So for now, just try your best and document your findings. You can even spin it as how to help other new onboarders by detailing what was hard to learn in your team’s system, missing docs or metrics, etc. Good luck!",

        "body": "This was me when I started working as a SWE 5 years ago. I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn’t amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn’t know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn’t.But they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That’s very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that’s what a lot of teams look for. It’s worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.Related: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring. So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. I spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I’m a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. Just get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you’re asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it’s a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions. It’s their job, and they will only be bothered heavily if you’re saying “idk what to do”",

Or maybe it is more accurate to say that recruitment only has the knowledge and information to follow a poorly-formed decision tree.The first thing they do is filter to only proceed with people who have direct experience in whatever technology is used at the company. While it is beneficial for a new engineer to already be familiar with Python if the business uses Python, this is filtering out many, many highly qualified candidates. It would be much better to initially filter out engineers that do not have sufficient skills, and then work from there. But that’s a lot harder than following a rubric. Recruiters typically don’t know how to assess this, especially when there’s a lot of buzz-wording and fluff to grok through on resumes.",

It’ll still be engineering strategy for a while, but manage enough projects, and you will (slowly) start to earn trust and opportunities with people that make product decisions. You’ll still be on the hook for delivering pieces of projects, but more and more will be delegated as you become more senior, to the point that you are influencing multiple teams and orgs. Personally the journey has been: manage projects under my manager -> manage projects under my manager’s manager across teams -> manage projects for the org working with PMs and multiple senior managers -> manage projects for the product working with directors -> influence projects for the product working with product and directors. Your code will start shift from low level to higher level abstractions, to shared tooling and libraries, to just straight up docs and roadmaps.",

The context of the original intent is lost because there’s no planning or architecture.I raise a concern like hey… technically this is a wheel but I don’t think it meets our requirements. This is shut down because I’m worrying too much about what-if’s… design just asked for a wheel right?So we end up bolting the dirtbike tire to the steering column and sure you can steer the car I guess.Then I get assigned a ticket to add an airbag, something we all knew was on the feature roadmap. I know another dev would just duct tape an airbag on that wouldn’t work, but I feel obligated to refactor it into a proper steering wheel. This gets seen as scope creep, and I can’t for the life of me convince anyone it was necessary.So now I think I’m at the point I need to start using duct tape or look for a different car to build so to speak :man_shrugging:",

It's not that you have to have a deep understanding of every layer, top to bottom, but at least be able to sketch it out and know a little bit about what it does. It's totally normal if the parts \"far\" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.This in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:>“Tell me something about RTOS”>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”You've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it? An open ended question like this is really your time to shine, you get to steer the conversation. Be able to crush those kinds of questions.And to be clear here, you don't have to know everything about it by any stretch. But you should have at least a couple nuggets of hard-fought learning. Something you debugged or implemented where you had to go brush up a bit?You're going to get questions about work you've done, and you want to be able to hit more or less these couple items in the response1. What problem you were trying to solve with the example you give?2. What did your changes build leverage from the layer below, how is the layer above going to use them?3. How does what you did work, to a decent level of detail?4. What tradeoffs are there to consider?5. How did you validate what you did?Think back to some tasks you've done and try to answer those questions about them. Try just writing the answers down, don't worry about how long it takes you.If you're not able to do it, even after some time and thought, you need to start revisiting how you're trying to grow your skills as an engineer. Make sure you understand the context around stuff you are doing. Occasionally take something apart you don't understand, even if it works, just to learn it better.If you're able to do it after taking a breath and pondering on it a bit, then you probably just need to work on your speaking skills and confidence a bit. Running through the jot it down exercise will help you there as well. If you have some willing friends, try just explaining stuff to them, and have them ask you questions about it.And hey, no need to despair, these are all things you can practice and improve. Most of us deal with some level of imposter syndrome too, you're not the first guy in this situation and you won't be the last. Put in the effort and you'll be just fine. Good luck!",

The embedded knowledge you do have actually gives you a solid foundation in systems thinking and low-level concepts that many general SWE candidates lack entirely.You're probably overthinking this transition. Your embedded background demonstrates you can work with complex systems, debug tricky issues, and understand performance constraints - all valuable skills that translate well to general software development. Focus your prep time on the things that actually matter for these roles: data structures and algorithms, system design, and getting comfortable with the languages and frameworks they use. The fact that you can navigate codebases and solve problems is exactly what they're looking for, not your ability to recite protocol specifications.I'm on the team that built [AI for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen plenty of engineers successfully transition between specialties by focusing their interview prep on the core competencies that matter most for their target roles.",

In vscode you can command click the stack trace lines in the terminal to go to that part of the code. Usually you can just click the line that is right before an external library call. But, you can also click into external library code stack lines and even edit it if you want to add print statements there.A few of the tough errors I see people get stuck on are circular imports. But, it's not hard to break those.A lot of people say to use debuggers. I usually find print statements quicker.I think it helps if you have a more experienced person that can explain the information you're missing when you get stuck.There are some categories of errors I see people get stuck on, but that would be a lot to go over. if theres something in particular you struggle with I could maybe give advice.",

I don't need to actually plan rolling out those changes; only reflect on whats going well versus isnt. then maybe I look up how other people have solved those problems, and decide if they are in a better, worse or the same position as we are.thats how to build up architectural strength; spiral out from what you know well and work with often to technologies you dont know as well and reflect on how their application to your work might be good or bad.",

I went deep into clean/hexagonal architecture, event-driven architecture, DDD, CQRS, and the C4 model, and applied it all to my finance project.To get there, I had to learn to view the project from multiple high-level angles. I studied how frameworks like Symfony and Laravel worked, read obsessively, connected the dots, and eventually everything \"clicked\".In the end, once you reach the stage of designing projects from scratch, you realize it’s just an endless list of “next steps.” The key is having the right tools and knowing when to apply it.",

I barely understood what was happening with our components and applications I was working with every day, there was no way I could understand how to make a new one. Things that helped me were:* Seeing more codeI would read carefully through other teammates PRs and ask they why they wrote their code the way that they did. What would I have done differently? What can I \"steal\" for my future coding problems?* Understanding the codebase betterWhen I get stuck on a programming task, the first question I ask is \"why is it broken\". The second question used to be \"how do I make it work\". But now I look more at \"what does it do\", \"how does it do that\" and \"why does it do that\" before I ask \"how do I make it work\"*  Generally understanding technologies, services and concepts betterI had to learn what a nosql database was before I could understand why I would choose to use one. Understand what race conditions were before I could try to avoid them. Know what different kinds of caches there are before I could choose a good one. Know what cloud services do before I could choose which one to use in a system.  This last one can seem like a lot. And no one really wants to study after work. But I just found a YouTube playlist with systems design concepts and listened to it while commuting. It gave me a base level of knowledge that lets me ask clarifying questions when discussions happen.",

Optimize your searching methodology and application process.I have some tips for job searching too, but don't want to make this post too long.If, for example, your job search takes over 2 months, and you allocate 1/3 of your time toward personal growth, that is about 300 hours toward personal growth, which is plenty of time for another new \"thing\" to tack on your resume.",

The key is persistence and playing the volume game smartly: apply to more positions daily, expand your search beyond the obvious big tech companies to include smaller startups and non-tech companies that need developers, and consider contract or part-time roles as stepping stones.The interview process being exhausting is just the unfortunate reality of how companies hire now, but you can make it more manageable by treating each interview as practice for the next one. Focus on getting really good at articulating your projects and technical decisions, and prepare solid examples that demonstrate problem-solving skills. Each grueling interview process is actually making you stronger for the next one, even when you don't get the offer. I'm on the team that built [interview AI assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate those tricky technical and behavioral questions that come up during the multiple rounds you're dealing with - it can be a game-changer for feeling more confident and prepared when you land those precious interviews.",

        "body": "I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communicationI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.As for your questions:1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. If you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. One really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. I will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. I hope that covers all of your questions! If not, feel free to ask more!",

Do you think that ceiling is common across Dynamics roles, or more specific to Business Central? I’m in a good financial position now, so I’m trying to think long-term before switching.If you were starting fresh today, which track would you recommend focusing on — CE/CRM, Business Central, or Finance & Operations? And is the uptick in demand you’re seeing more regional or global?From a career growth perspective, what kind of work do you think is needed to build a strong path in Dynamics and eventually move into leadership/architect positions? With my .NET and enterprise systems background, do you think I could make more of a lateral transition, or would I likely have to take a step down first to break into the space?Thanks again for the detailed response — this really helps me get a clearer picture of what to expect.",

I think the uptick is in the US and Europe and is more specific to BC. I haven’t heard much outside of those regions. With 5+ years of .NET experience in enterprise systems, I would think you should be able to make a lateral transition. As for career growth into an architect/leadership role, I’d say the most important thing is knowing the product well (functionally) and how it can be modified (technically) to meet the needs of the user.

Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. Your role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.Before you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

Focus on your experience, and try to make that sound cool (9 years is hella impressive!). At that point, interviewers rarely care about personal projects. You'll have to learn about how best to present yourself, though.However, if you're not in a rush to find a new position, I'd recommend that you upskill. Try to think about as many interesting and complex features as possible that can be added to your project. The more complex it sounds, the more you'll learn from it. At the very least, learn some basic AI/LLM stuff and add it to your project. Also, your UI looks kinda bad. I get it that you're not a frontend person, but you can just use ChatGPT or whatever LLM of your choice to generate a beautiful UI for you. The first impression anyone gets about your website is from how it looks, so don't make them prejudiced against it by making it look bad.As for the freelance - no idea, honestly, don't have any experience with that. However, that would also really depend on your sales skills, so evaluate those first.Anyways, good luck to you and all the best!",

I've worked with multiple data scientists in industry with degrees in physics.Most all hiring managers and any decent recruiter will not find anything amiss with the credentials and background.**To answer your questions directly**: (1) you don't need to express the value of your experience in a particularly special way, (2) most certifications won't help much but could help to convince people you're more ready to go in certain aspects (see below), and (3) most people aren't really looking for portfolios. Internship and job experience trump other factors.Anyway, through your resume and in interviews you will need to convince people that1. You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers. A team writing production code for algorithms will want somebody familiar with using git and coding in a team environment, for example.Most people will assume you have the capacity to meet all the criteria but will want to test if you're already at (or close to) a level where you can contribute without too much fuss.It definitely doesn't help at all that the expectations and responsibilities for data scientists vary widely across companies and teams.",

The computational work you did simulating neural networks demonstrates exactly what data science employers want to see - the ability to work with complex systems, handle large datasets, and solve problems that don't have obvious solutions. When you're in interviews, frame your research as what it really was: advanced data analysis and modeling work. Talk about the scale of data you worked with, the computational challenges you solved, and how you validated your models. That's pure data science experience, just in a different domain.Skip the certifications and focus your energy on translating your existing projects into a portfolio that speaks the business language. Take that neural network simulation and present it as a machine learning project - discuss the algorithms you implemented, the performance metrics you used, and the insights you generated. Create a GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code and write up your projects with clear explanations of your methodology and results. Your PhD work is far more impressive than any online certificate, but you need to present it in terms that hiring managers can immediately understand. I work on [interview AI helper](http://interviews.chat) to practice articulating the business value of your research experience when those tricky \"tell me about your background\" questions come up in interviews.",

ICS security is blowing up, very high demand, and your automation exp makes you stand out big time. way better option than competing with 100k random web dev bootcampers.so imo don’t waste your edge. go embedded/industrial software if you like low-level + devices, or ICS security if you want money + growth. backend only if you really wanna shift into generic software. what’s your end goal btw, stay local or move abroad?",

Of course, since you already have a background in react, you may have an easier time switching back than I am having making that pivot. But I have read that this is a hard switch for others as well even if they did it prior.Platform/ops work is a lot of being on call and putting out urgent fires. And day-to-day, it's a lot of YAML and not a lot of true code work, and its definitely not as creatively fulfilling as regular development. Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform. You may just be working on tooling and framework stuff that isn't a stressful, but anytime you work on a horizontal as opposed to a vertical, you are liable to be pulled into issues in parts of the system you don't know about and expected to help troubleshoot them during high pressure situations. Some people do love it though and you may be one of those people. edit: TLDR take whichever one offers you the most money, but be aware you may be taking a hit to your WLB for this type of tole.",
