While that’s certainly true at many large companies like Meta or Amazon where you’re basically slinging SQL and little else, it’s most certainly not true at companies like Capital One or Airbnb or Netflix; there, your job is practically 1:1 with software engineering. That being said, a great percentage of DE’s need to study DSA, time/memory complexity, and CS fundamentals, instead of memorizing frameworks and assuming everything’s Gucci. It’s the fundamentals that evidently are the “hard stuff”.To provide an actual metric that illustrates what I mean: at a company I will not name, I encountered a legacy process that took 55 hours but was reduced to 6.5 seconds, as well as ~5x less memory allocation, simply by using Aho-Corasick instead of regex, parallelization instead of serialization, and basic optimizations using concepts like “tidy data” and sets. That’s the difference between throwing SQL at everything and knowing when certain tools and techniques apply best or worst.",

You often need to ensure your pipelines will work (or at least fail gracefully) with bad data and not hang with huge amounts of data.You also have to deal with external APIs or flat file transfers where your assumptions will be based on the documentation the external party provides. You quickly come to realise this documentation is often old or just plain incorrect so building a test suite on it is a lesson on futility.This is obviously much harder to do than writing unit tests of your own code and when the pressures mount of delivering integrations and new data products to the business mount, testing can often fall by the wayside with data engineers falling back on \"we'll test it in live!\".This, compounded by the fact that setting up a testing environment that truly represents your production database/data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming all combine to mean tests are a much less rigourously followed discipline in data engineering.Does that mean you should skip them altogether? Absolutely not, but ensuring you have 100% unit test code coverage is not nearly as valuable as ensuring a complex pipeline has a decent set of integration and stress tests for, say, 75% of its functionality.The reality is that most data engineers will be lucky to get anywhere near that, which is almost certainly why they were impressed you wrote tests at all. It should mean that you approach the challenges above with the right mindset, rather than just avoiding them because testing is hard on data engineering.",

Source database keep changing their entities and fields, so that we ```SELECT``` from the wrong columns,2. Data that we expect… are more mendacious than we anticipated.3. Sometimes, data is forbidden from us because these data are personally-identifiable information and we have to first deploy our ETL pipelines first, so that our business users/customers verify that our SQL statements are correct and generate the right output.Unit tests are largely useful if you want to enforce a culture of \"make sure you cover your asses first.\" In a large corporate or public sector environment, however, we exploit gaps in either technical or structural (i.e. \"the data is not cleansed properly\") situations to push back effort.Is this bad? Absolutely. Companies and public sectors, however, care not about holistic software development (remember how **hard** it is to employ *zero trust model* as a way to develop our software, let alone ETL pipelines?).",

The other tasks you mentioned are what I'd consider data engineering.At the end of the day, the longer you do it, the more you will become \"the guy who does dashboards\". From the way you describe it, it doesn't sound like that's who you want to become. You're doing the right thing right now by going with the flow and getting things done, but I'd advise talking to your manager about the trajectory you want your career to go. If they insist on keeping your responsibilities like this, I'd probably leave sooner rather than later. Won't make it any easier in the future finding jobs in the DE field if all you've done is data viz for two years lol",

Just like it's easy to be scared of any arduous, uncertain process like trying to break into ANY new career.My view: GenAI will make Data Scientists + DE more efficient. GenAI will allow these folks to tackle new, complex problems as simpler & more-rote work gets automated. But to get to that point, where you can leverage AI well – you need to know the fundamentals of the field. So keep working hard, don't get discouraged, and work through the basics so you can come out the other side in the next year or two as an AI-empowered DE, rather than the noob DE that gets replaced by AI.",

Simple enough. He couldn’t get it to work. Found out he used Gemini to generate the code…which was riddled with errors. The intern showed a poor understanding of the assignment and an absolute reliance on AI.Another example: we get CSV dumps from financial organizations daily. One of the orgs had changed their CSV specs without informing us. It broke our pipeline, which led to garbage data being loaded, which led to dashboards being broken. Fixing this problem required long conversations with that org, their techs, our DBA, our DevOps. We had to manually reload the files before the breakage, update our ETL code, update our Snowflake table and our dashboards. How would AI have helped here?IMO AI shows potential in software development itself. But the tools themselves (GH’s copilot, Google Gemini, ChatGPT) are still in their infancy.",

What is the advantage of having to manage 10 different tools, getting them working with each other and addressing their specific shortcomings that justifies not just going with spark? I am as curious as the next person, but curiosity is not how I decide what my stack will be.",

It is good to know what will work at this moment, learning will never stop. 4. Most of the content is available for free, courses will give you the same content but in a structured manner.5.

First gig was moving a company from solely paper to Microsoft Access. Things have changed in the intervening years and while “select * from ” still works, my SQL is rusty as hell - so feels like starting over from scratch.Anyhow, I am going through a lot of free resources, but I need to be more disciplined with the learning and actually finishing projects/courses. Bad ADHD keeps me starting or reading about new tech, but not actually fully understanding them before I move on to the next shiny. The tech environment is festooned with tons of shiny stuff that actually gets in the way of finishing a project.So, been doing the DE ZoomCamp free course. It’s a bit janky, the instructors vary in quality (although I really like Alexei) and not everything is straightforward, but I think it’s a pretty realistic way to learn DE. Real life is not going to be laid out well either and projects will develop their own idiosyncrasies that have to be navigated. Also taking Joe Reis’s Data Engineering course on Coursera. It’s very AWS focused, but I think I’ll be able to sit for the AWS Data Engineering Associate Cert with some extra study time. I’m not a certificate enthusiast but the job market seems to like them, so why not help our your resume. It’s very streamlined and I am only in course 2 but he does talk about the non-tech skills DEs need to have to do their job. That’s been helpful.Also looked at Joseph Machado’s StartDataEngineering newsletter. That’s been informative and has exposed me to some new ideas. Since it is a free news letter, it doesn’t hurt. I also joined a couple of groups that SeattleDataGuy has running over LinkedIn, but haven’t really done much with them at the moment. There is a LOT of noise in the DE space, with “influencers” pushing a ton of crap on hopeful DEs, so being skeptical of some of the recommendations is wise. My LinkedIn is flooded with them since I put a data engineering focus to my profile. I have a couple of ideas for some projects I’ve been mulling over. I have one in mind to grab all the publicly available BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data/projections and then see how they’ve revised them in the following months. I am curious to see how (in)accurate they have been since they’ve started. Good luck and feel free to DM if you want to bounce ideas around.",

If I really want I can also pick data projects more leaning towards DS, Data analytics and even data governance. A lot of development jobs are maintaining large enterprise applications which isn't the most interesting to me, if you're unlucky you get a project maintaining or rewriting legacy systems, I almost lost a team of 5 colleagues from the java department because the project simply was not fun.I like programming but I don't like it that much to only do that and consistently keep up the programming skills, the combination of cloud, data & AI with modern technology and arguably the safest job now is mainly what keeps me interested.",

I would say if you like gaming and you are an engineer, you are very likely to enjoy this game. Anedotally, I have yet to meet somebody who meets those criteria who doesn’t like factorio (or satisfactory for that matter). Note, if you don’t like gaming already then I am not sure.Why is this the case? At its core its about automating things!You basically have to create logistics pipelines that take raw materials, put them through various stages of processing to make things that can then be used to make other things. You have particular objectives that grow in complexity as the game goes on. In the beginning you can get away with a spaghetti pipeline, but as the game goes on and complexity ramps up, it essentially forces you how to think modularly and in terms of abstractions and interfaces. So instead of working at the level of single processing units, you will eventually need to think at the level of many different processing units. Then you have to think through input rate, output rate etc etc. Other challenges you have to account for is being able to take input resources from different places as they run out! And it also has a bit of pragmatism in that in the core game mode you also have to defend yourself against aliens (product / manager analogy) so you can’t just put everything into building the perfect factory, also needs to be able to defend itself quickly.Hope that gives you some idea!",

If you need this kinda of performance just go for streaming.BI querys is a different story and I think people are not using vanilla spark for that",

If you're primarily dealing with marketing data sources, specialized connectors like Windsor.ai can handle those integrations more cost effectively than Fabric.

IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.The first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center? I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack? So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.The second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have? A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?' Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'The third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here? Then maybe outline a plan for an incremental move to this stack you want.",

Everything you put effort into needs to be laser focussed on reducing the chance of both those things happening.I'm not convinced a data warehouse is the right move if your manager doesn't think it is. You can build and retrofit one down the line when there's a compelling reason and/or enough stability in the company's economics. I say this as a lover of data warehouses, Kimball, Roche's Maxim, and good data architecture in general: but there's a time and a place.My employer, a ~500 person publicly traded company, managed for _many years_ without a data warehouse, pulling data directly into Power BI from quite a few different business applications, with a lot of logic repetition between different semantic models. Would it have been easier if they'd done a DW from the outset, long before I joined? Yes, but then adoption of Power BI might not have taken off and the whole initiative could have been binned.Much better to provide business value quickly, in a way that's horrible behind the scenes, and then sort it out incrementally while adding more business value steadily. Kimball even advocates for this quite explicitly in DWTK!",

It’s a question of where you want to discover and solve your problems, when the end user finds them, or before?As a DE my end users are BI engineers, their end users are dashboard/report users. When a report user reports an issue, do I tell the BI engineer to just write their dbt models or design their dashboards differently? No because the source of the problem (the data) might also be causing issues elsewhere, it’s just not been reported yet, so I find the root cause and fix it as far upstream as possible so the fix benefits as many downstream assets as possible.When you write code do you write it in a text editor without an LSP, and discover all your syntax errors at compile time? Or god forbid, in the case of business logic mistakes, let your end users find and report the issue? No, you write code using LSP so you see syntax errors before your compiler does, you write unit tests so your business logic is verifiably correct, you write integration tests to make sure your unit works in correspondence with a larger system - these are all ways that we shift the problem discovery / fix left in the development cycle as much as possible.",

With that said, I feel qualified to speak on it as a data engineer given I've devoted the past ~3 years to this problem and I'm writing an O'Reilly book on the subject.First and foremost, \"shift left\" pulls from already established paradigms in security and DevOps; and applying that to data. The core problem in those two spaces was disparate and high volume changes that downstream teams could no longer manage, and thus responsibility needed to \"shift left\" to upstream software engineers to manage such requirements.Key to this is not just shifting responsibility, but making it as easy as possible for these upstream engineers to engage in the desired practices within their existing dev workflows. Thus \"shift left\" isn't respective to where you are in the data lifecycle (e.g. upstream vs downstream), it's clearly looking at application code if we are following the same patterns it was established in other domains mentioned earlier.Thus, \"shift left\" in data revolves around prevention at \"design time\" as compared to \"run time\" like observability (both are valuable). This is why data contracts are core to the shift left narrative in data, as it validates if changes meet expectations within the CI/CD process.Here are some great resources if you want to learn more:1.

As a lead engineer, you will probably be doing some solution architecture, perhaps some more logical/conceptual work as well. You will still be firmly in a technical track, working with code, but, with leadership and design aspects.As a data architect, you'll be further removed from results and focus more on design, stakeholder management and getting teams to share a vision. You will be working in PowerPoint, archimate and other design tools as well, not so much in code. It requires sales skills and the ability to stick it out for a while before your vision becomes reality.",

        "body": "You need to ingest your data.You have to orchestrate what runs when.You need to clean and transform your data to make it usable.You need to store your data.You need to access your data.That are the fundamentals which will never change.With that being said all tech stack depends of a lot of factors.Ingest : could be done in any language. I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it. Orchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it’s way harder to get setup than the “new” stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have “new” orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.Clean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.Most compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN’T have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it’s 100 millions rows every hour that’s another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.For OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.OLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouseThere’s a lot more but that cover most scenarios or “new” companyAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.So no real definitive stack but you have those.If I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there’s going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.Why? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it’s good for the business, they’ll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don’t have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.If it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I’ll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.If you don’t have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.There no real stack but those are nice.Personally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it’s better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.Good luck",

So if you need to write AWS lambda functions that ingest files from excel files, and convert them to some other format, you could use polars. Note that this data ISN’T in the database yet. As for the scripts mentioned above, I may want/need to explore the contents of a file before I load it into my database. Or just pull some summary metrics for one file to compare them to the loaded data.As for why you might load data onto your local machine…cost, maybe? Running things on your local machine is basically free. Or maybe you want to do some joining and analysis with a data set that isn’t in the database, and would be annoying to get in there—that annoyance could be engineering based or it could be due to workplace policies.I’ll leave you with the thought that there’s a million ways to skin the cat, and engineers are constantly inventing new ones.I could—and do—convert files using glue in Fargate, and sometimes I crawl data in S3 using Athena. Gotta do the math to see what’s the right tool for the job. And sometimes you just do something like polars or pandas because it’s dead simple, quick, and reliable.",

The 3rd edition is the most recent, possibly the last (Kimball is firmly retired now IIRC), definitely the version to buy (substantial additions over 2nd edition) and still as relevant as 1996. It's not all that technical, it's really more about concepts, approaches, and best practices. There's a bit of SQL but it's not all about code.",

For one, and before AI generating code, they were mainly implemented to solve scalability problems that not every company will have. Why put everything in code? Why version control? Why CI/CD? Why SSoT for metrics / semantic layer? Etc etc. These are super hard to explain until you can demonstrate the consequences of not doing them. So naturally, people will lump them into the same boat as shiny new features designed to churn profit. Good thing is, with AI everyone is suddenly open to change if it helps them implement AI. Bad news is, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors (like reselling chatgpt or throwing AI at bad data) that will make it harder to convince people of change if/when it crashes.",

Patch in place -- you know the tradeoffs here2. Blow it up -- kills momentum and requires that you maintain the current system and add new features while you get the new system up to speed3. Incremental transition -- much higher complexity because each move needs to maintain compatibility with parts that haven't moved yet.",

But IMO refactoring piece by piece is usually better than rebuilding from the ground up. A good starting place may be getting all of your code running on the same deployment pattern. And then perhaps migrating it to airflow or dagster or something since you seem to be leaning that way.If you’re lucky your pipelines aren’t reliant on each other and you can do refactor + add a test suite one pipeline at a time.",

With 100k+ requests, you're probably looking for sub-second response times. However, even with lots of optimization, this isn't what Snowflake excels at.Regarding pricing: As you pay mainly for storage and warehouse uptime, there are no specific caveats. Regarding scaling, it would possibly make more sense to scale-out (more XS warehouses to serve requests in parallel). What we did is performing the transformations in Snowflake and export a denormalized table, and imported it into a Postgres. Which achieves <100 ms response times for 50+ attributes per record paginated with 100 records out of 1.5b records even on a very small configuration. However, within the last 12 months, a couple of things changed:1. Introduction of hybrid tables allowing Snowflake to perform better on OLTP tasks - we haven't tried this out yet as we are on Azure, and hybrid tables are on GA only on AWS2. Snowflake's recent aquisition of Crunchy Data and the announcement of Snowflake Postgres - we are waiting for news hereEDIT: Spelling & grammarEDIT 2: corrected Crunchy Data",

Are we happy with this?\" and if they yes, I did a good job, if not, I ask, \"oh sorry, what's missing/needed here to get this over the line\" and instead of all that time panicking, I just go back to work and have a sticky notes app because my memory is too also terrible.",

As you progress in your career you run into an issue enough times (or versions of it) that you have a sense of what a solution might be without a night of tinkering.

There are always periods where I need to use extra/free time to get my balance again. Some paths lead to more work. Systems can be designed in a way that frees up your time and energy. I’ve learned to steer my stakeholders and analysts away from things I know will burn my time later for little value. What is your career outlook here?

You don't always see the effort others put in, and people who go down the road of attacking their superiors are almost always wrong, and usually get blacklisted or fired, so keep your head down and focus on your own work. Again, not sure if this is your tone, but the advice stands in case it's ever relevant.2. Get the idea of \"X hours worked\" out of your head now while you're hourly (Even though that is your whole world as an intern). You are all there to perform a service -- if that service is performed in 30 hours per week, then 10 hours is spent doing useless busywork to appear productive. But you'll have plenty of times when there's an emergency deadline and you're pulling 60 hours, that's what \"exempt\" (salary) means. You say you see them leave early, but did you see them crash on the couch in the lobby during the audit last year?3. There are no gold stars, rewards, raises, or bonuses for working harder/longer than contractually obligated. Especially at a company of 3,700 employees. And even more especially as a DE, your contributions will go with little more than a \"Thanks!\" if not completely unnoticed. The only time you will be \"seen\" is when something goes *wrong*, like a plumber or electrician.TLDR: Keep your head down, do your job, and hope that your future in DE is as \"relaxed\" as you seem to think it might be.",

When a schema change for column addition is needed, we make sure they're ok for us to add columns without changes on their end, and do so. Once that data is ready, they can make changes on their end to bring in the new column(s). Avoiding coordinated change windows is the key, because it causes immense difficulty when working across teams.If a column is being removed, we essentially do the reverse. Downstream removes their dependency on it, then we remove it. If this ever has to be inverted, then the new first-moving team needs to set up a view or some other 'dummy' mechanism to spoof the presence of the data, so that they can make their change now and let the other team catch up later.For ingestion we make use of lake storage -- we capture raw data and raw files, exactly as upstream provides them. We read the data as long as it is compatible, it does not have to be identical, but we do flag for changes in schema as they will need to be addressed. After read, we write to conformed tables that use a schema we set, so we can add in dummy data or drop columns as needed. Ideally upstream works with us and provides two copies when a change is happening, one in the old schema and another in the new, then we can switch over at any point (ie they are first mover in this scenario).",

If you can jump straight to analytics engineer, that would be even better.I argue data engineering is a role you go into after you get experience in the software engineering space and want to specialize, or you come from a data role and want to have more of an engineering focus (I went from data science to data engineering myself).Agree with others that Python, SQL, and dbt are going to be the best use of your time. Especially dbt for analytics engineering roles.Another thing to note is that I'm seeing Typescript come up A LOT for AI deployments. I'm strongly considering learning typescript myself because of this. I would definitely prioritize python over this, but if I had to choose another language after python and SQL, I would personally choose typescript.Finally, your work on MSE is a huge advantage if you position yourself right. You now have domain knowledge in manufacturing. Having such may lower the barrier of entry into a role. For example, I had a clinical research and health insurance background which helped me get my first data science role at a health tech company.Hope this helps!",

SQL Server DBA here so I know exactly what you’re talking about :smirking_face: Well, not the DuckLake parts but the rest of it :smirking_face: Like where’s the equivalent of an SSDT project here?!Take a look at SQLMesh. It supports and/or replaces dbt. It has column type tracking / lineage between all of those databases and a few more!To summarise, you define a SQL model in SQLMesh (just a file with a select statement… model (name xxx); select blah from y), it works out what the source tables are by querying the source database, and caches them in a yaml file (it’s also a one command line to regenerate this at any time, so it’s no big deal at all, you can also easily parse it by hand or script because it’s so basic, literally just the table name column name and data type). Now for any more references to those tables or that model or other models and nested models etc it tracks the lineage downwards. If you have it materialize the views it calculates all the data types of the tables to create, or you can also manually define and override them, or keep the whole thing as just views.It has a VS Code extension that shows you all of the column types in your models while you’re coding, too. It has an API (of sorts) you can call to scrape it into other applications as well (but that part is a bit funny; because you need to run it in UI mode which opens a local 8080 port, and you query that… easier than it sounds).Anyway have a look just to see if it does what you want. One last thing though. F MAX column types in SQL Server :grinning_face_with_sweat: Those are LOB types so every single row query will cause an additional lookup for every LOB column in it. That quickly *kills* performance even in a data warehouse :grinning_face_with_sweat: Oh it’s okay for CSV files and stuff where you can’t be sure what the limits are… I get that part… but in general it’s a big no :grinning_face_with_sweat:",

The inability in dbt contracts of being able to do varchar(n) max length type checks - I come from a MS SQL server backgorund and am used to defining max field lengths for most text columns. This one is interesting though - I'm going to be using postgres for the database for the first time and I have just realised the strict varchar(n) types I'm useed to aren't really needed for the majority of columns because text / varchar data types will suffice - so it's less of a concern now. 2. I saw it as likely being a better debugging experience to pick up schema errors by tests (rather than using contracts which prevent the models from creating - although I get it that's what you'd want to happen). I'll also be creating other tests for expected values etc, so having all tests implemented the same way I saw as a cleaner apprach3. I just don't like the amount of yaml that gets created to implement schema checks via contracts (I think this is actually my biggest gripe). My first ingest pipeline has 30 files and some of them have 60+ columns - that is a lot of yaml needed not to mention dbt best practsies suggest putting it all in a single schema.yml file! That sounds a PITA for developers to maintain. Diffing metadata .schema changes in a small seed file is easy.",

You need to work to _make_ them match. Then the single product dimension becomes part of how you associate rows in one fact table with rows in another fact table. You don't ever link one fact table directly to another. You traverse the model via one or more dimensions that the two facts have in common. (Those common dimensions might include degenerate dims like a contract number, perhaps. If so, the DD should be un-degenerated (!) back to a very narrow true dimension table, with surrogate keys in all the relevant fact tables.)You should work on that Product dimension before the facts, at least to get the basic approach and structure sorted, if row-by-row matching will take time. You can use tools like splink to figure out the links, potentially.(Unless they are actually different unrelated products? Like the contract is for a finished car, but the invoice is for components like engine block, axle, brake disk, etc. If so, Product and Component are probably two separate dimensions.)",

It is big enough that sustainability and ecotox is a very big deal given the scale and there is obviously external pressure being such a big company. Small changes to supply chain or ingredients can have big implications on the environment (and communities). There is a big push internally for eco-labelling our products in the way ingredients are.There are lots of data challenges when selling in ~200 countries with tens of thousands of products. Being able to estimate say, greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle assessment for a product portfolio right down to biodegradability of packaging types, or even how well recycling centres can detect plastics etc. isn’t easy. Tools like https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/ exist but they need very granular data right down to global sales.I’m more on the human safety side so don’t personally get all that close to it but PM me any questions if you think I can help. I bridge a lot of science areas but our sustainability and ecotox have by far the lowest tech skills, so there may not be that many jobs but someone with domain knowledge and even basic tech skills may be rare. A few people have left that area for oil companies, lol.",

        "body": "I would understand if you’re hesitant given the current political climate, but have you considered looking into the national lab complex (DOE) ? Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you’d initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you’re interested in. This is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you’re into is very valuable. On the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we’re usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don’t (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn’t otherwise be available. On the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. Also, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it’s easier to move around (even between labs) once you’re in and making connections. My advice would be to make connections with staff whose research you’d be interested in assisting with. Some will be more open than others, but if they like you and need your skill set, they may be able to create a new DE position with you in mind, or at least point you to another group that might need you.ETA: I ended up in renewable-adjacent work with a background in mechanical engineering and experience with machine learning. I’ve learned everything I know about DE on the job, and I’m not the only person I know who’s done that. I will also admit I knew someone (outside of research) at a lab who was able to pass my resume around more directly. So I mean it when I advise making connections with existing staff. It only got me to the interview stage, but sometimes that’s enough.",

One simple way to \"sync\" the two is to just make dev tables views pointing to prd tables.If you are doing streaming, Databricks has a few articles about that too.",

I generally suggest running jobs via service principals in prod. It shouldn’t really matter whether you execute your code as notebook or scripts, both are supported and can be run via service principals.

It suits me fine but some people would have preferred a GUI.Anyways, we can point dbt at any data catalog / database (at least, ones that have the same structure), run the tests (which are, under the hood) SQL statements, and get a pass-warn-fail output. Additionally, developers can write either custom hand-written SQL tests, or write some generic tests that turn into SQL. The downside is, again, lack of a really beautiful report, but for my team we are more focused on repeatable, reusable regression tests.Finally, I ended up having to write the \"does the data in this table match the data in this table except for these columns\" tests myself.

If you want to be fancy, you could add some kind of active indicator field to filter for the latest record easily. People often need that. Or just make a history and current view.

        "body": "Despite the emphasis on computer code as something that does something in a computer, what it also fundamentally is an expression of human thought. (That's not as pretentious as it sounds. Pretty much any thing else expressive is, especially if it involves language, like a song or even this post.)When you look at someone else's code, you're looking at how they expressed their ideas in a form that can be executed on a computer. Different people will have different takes on that, even for the same problem. (That's one reason why one person's code may make immediate sense and someone else's doesn't - it can very much depend on whether you're thinking about the problem the same way they are or not.) So a key part of being able to read someone else's code is to approach it from a \"what were they thinking when they wrote this\" point of view. One of the first things you can do to help understand the code is identify what concepts they're expressing in the code - what the various players are, so to speak. The sooner you can grasp the bigger picture and what ideas are involved, the easier it will be once you get down into the details.One thing that will help you over time is having more and more exposure to different ideas. If you're looking at an HTTP server implementation, for example, it will make a lot more sense if you've seen one before, so you know what things are and how they interact. So a big part of being able to more readily understand code is having already been exposed to the concepts its trying to express, even if later it's expressed in a way you haven't seen before. You can know what the underlying ideas are.Unfortunately, this is where a lot of documentation comes up short. The individual calls makes sense once you have a broader view - the big picture - but the documentation often seems to start from the (unspoken) point of view that you already know all that. So you end up having to try to work out it's an elephant and not a tree or a snake.What will make reading code easier over time is:\\- Seeing (and understanding) enough code that can know the various idioms and, more importantly, what they *mean*. That is, what the developer was most likely trying to say when they wrote the code.\\- Gaining knowledge in the domains the code is a solution for, so you can know what things mean more readily and can more quickly get the lay of the land once you dive in.\\- Writing more code yourself. Discovering how *you* express ideas will give you critical insight into how *others* express ideas in code. Eventually, you'll get to a point where you'll be able to see code and go \"I know what that means\" because you've not only seen it before but written it yourself before.Hope that helps!\\[Note: Not all code is going to be so easily digested, even with experience. Some code is poorly written. Some software developers are insane. You can only work with what you're given. :) )",

A webpage stored locally that can only display information isn’t useful, so technologies were developed to solve these issues, which increased complexity. Honestly, an interesting simile to your observation would be, why do we need C/C++ if we could do everything in Assembly, which is the simplest language. An analog would be, why need a drill press when you have a drill. The reason why complexity exists, is because we have more complex problems.The tools and frameworks developers use that are “complex” actually have streamlined a lot of issues for us. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to process text if no one made “Stream” packages, or how annoying frontend webdev would be if frameworks like Vue.js and React didn’t exist?Just because something is complex, doesn’t mean it’s bad, but again, it becomes less complex when you get experience.",

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.You would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a \"bare metal\" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?Mobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do \"bad things\", you cannot do \"bare metal\" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different \"operating systems\", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.You will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it. Raw SDL is fine if what you're doing is fairly simple, a few UI elements there, a sprite there, but once you get beyond a certain level of complexity you'll either be wrapping it in your own engine, starting to use a framework yourself, or you \"muscle through\" it and create an unholy abomination that's a mess to work with.",

        "body": "I’m seeing weird answer here. The reason why a simple hello world is so difficult to get going dates back to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.Enter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.Now as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.This is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text elementI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",

Honestly you can get by for a very long time without knowing anything about trees or graphs, or Big-O notation - and I have yet to meet the person who actually *had* to implement quicksort or any other sorting algorithm from memory (and didn't just do it because it was a fun exercise).I think DSA is fun, and like everything else in programming it gives you a whole new perspective on how to think about data, and it helps you understand and implement well-known algorithms - but the idea that you MUST know how and why quicksort or red black trees work, that's just ridiculous.Like a carpenter doesn't have to be a wood scientist, a programmer doesn't have to be a computer scientist, because Computer Science isn't programming - it is the study of how computers can be programmed to perform computations. And vice versa - just because you can provide a mathematical proof that your sorting algorithm will perform in O(n log n) it doesn't mean that you can implement the feature that the customer asks for.",

I've got a masters degree in CS, have led teams and certainly don't think you need those fundamentals to be a developer (even a good one). But learning them will most definitely improve your quality as a developer and skill level. If you want to go down the technical path I recommend learning those fundamentals. Also to be clear - it's not about just learning specific algorithms. It's understanding data structures, complexities of algorithms and trade-offs. It's about understanding how to develop algorithms when you need them. I've seen a lot of developers claiming they are not interested in \"CS trivia\", dismissing value of fundamental CS knowledge. In my opinion that's a mistake.",

This is an unfortunate reality of today’s developer market. I am in the same boat as you and even went much stupider into enrolling into a software engineering university as well as a bootcamp and some self learning myself. I have some familiarity some projects but nothing fully transactional. The market itself makes me build my own SaaS instead of even thinking to try anything like internships and so on. I thought university will actually provide internships but it seems I am so far away from that that I can’t even believe it how ridiculous it is. It’s majority about networking and actual shipping products. I had in mind a bit of technical ability and then get into the project management leadership roles as I already have experience as a manager/leader…. I have no chance for anyone to invest in me as I’m not a code monkey and no one does anything these days because of the budget… It’s just pushes us into other jobs until we are able to find a team to fit ourselves into and then that belonging will be limited until this will again happen. That’s the cycle of a developer. So in conclusion yes get a job- you’ll learn less and invest more time but you will have something for the time being. Make sure the job you choose can actually be something you can always jump back to once developing ends until it starts back again. The dilo for a developer nowadays is worse than a dilo for a warehouse worker that is underpaid and overworked. This life… Enjoy",

Accordingly, the code I wrote to automate some of that work included a basic recursive tree linking algo in order to get a memory structure going where I could efficiently traverse the tree to do useful work with the data.",

        "body": "1. If you’re learning recursion as part of a degree, then it’s a good bet that your professors think it’s pretty important. Trust them.2. Recursion comes up all the time. Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic. I think the best thing you can do is write your question down now and come back to it in a few years, after you’ve taken more advanced courses. That goes back to item #1 on this list: trust your professors, they know a lot more than you do.",

What about a very ordinary programmer like me, with a couple of decades working in imperative languages where recursion is very much a choice?It's a tool for your mental toolbox. You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.Kinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common. Trees are obviously very likely to involve recursive operations and trees come up all the time in real world data wherever data are organised hierarchically: DOM trees, parse trees, nested spatial info, organisational charts, I'm sure you can think of many more examples where data are naturally nested in a self-similar manner.Most of my code is not recursive, but I wouldn't be a competent programmer if I didn't know how to use recursion when it's the better choice.",

In my opinion, the three main things are the following:* Connect with people in the field. Reach out to them. Ask questions. But most importantly, bring something to the table. Share what you’re working on or what you’ve learned.* Set learning objectives, always with a clear goal in mind. What do you want to achieve? Learning just for the sake of it can be a huge mistake.* Explore training programs or curriculums that interest you. Even if you don’t enroll, look into what they cover. Are you sure you have all the necessary background? One of the biggest challenges for self-learners is dealing with knowledge gaps.The ability to self-learn is, in my opinion, one of the strongest signs of both soft and hard skills. **Don’t doubt your abilities** mate, keep pushing and show the world what you can do.

Website support is one of them. With your skills, you can do some webmaster work. At this point you’re just a glorified artist. What you lack is database knowledge. :) I would recommend picking up some cloud certifications too. This will enable you to ensure that a website or a network resource is operating in addition to maintaining the page itself, and making sure it looks good. You’ll pick up additional skills and make friends at an MSP. Within a year or two, you can apply for analyst work. And once you land your first analyst role, the gates are open to pretty much anywhere you want. To be most rounded, I would recommend learning a little bit of shell (zsh, bash, batch, PS). Because being familiar with a shell is helpful no matter what your IT role is. You can make a lot of useful custom tools for yourself with the shell. For instance, in my role on a fairly regular basis I’ll find myself migrating large amounts of data. So I’ve modified my .bashrc to alias the “cp” command to basically be an “rsync” command with arguments to show progress and ensure file integrity.In the .bash_aliases file I’ve alias’d “ll” to be “ls -la” with a couple commands to “df” and “du”, to show me all files, hidden files, attributes, the device that the current working directory is on, and the total amount of disk space that current working directory is using. Different little things that help keep important information at my fingertips without needing to always remember complex, unintuitive syntax and arguments. I’ve made wrappers for system functions like tshark and udisksctl… anything that makes my job easier. That’s what’s super important about shell. You can use it to create whatever tools you need to make your life easier. You can make tools with any language really. But knowing how to do with a shell is very helpful because you won’t need to download or grab dependencies for some specific language.",

For which you need this thing called 'skill' which can be cultivated over time. Your main bottlenecked & scarce resource, however, is time. If you were going into the industry, OR if you had 40+ hours a week to spend on this, then this wouldn't be an issue.So, you'll have to choose a very specific niche. A combination of subgenre, programming language, framework, and deployment target should do the trick. Each of these will have entire books written on them... so they're all vast fields.... but if you niche down, you'll be able to get good relatively quickly.For example, you could just build puzzle games in javascript, using Phaser.js, for the web.Here are some more ideas.| # | Subgenre | Language | Framework | Deployment Target || - | --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- || 1 | Puzzle Games | JavaScript | Phaser.js | Web browser (Netlify, GitHub) || 2 | Note-taking Apps | TypeScript | Electron + React | Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) || 3 | Generative Art | Python | Processing (py) | Web gallery / local renders || 4 | Pixel Art Platformers | Lua | LÖVE2D | Desktop executable || 5 | Mobile Business Apps | Dart | Flutter | Mobile (Android & iOS) || 6 | Markdown Formatter CLI Tool | Rust | Clap | CLI via Homebrew / Cargo |The worst thing you can do is dilute yourself into many different fields.If you were going to enter the industry, I'd tell you to diversify. But you explicitly don't, so don't diversify ----- put all of your limited time into one specific combo.",

Since then, a lot of people have realized that good old relational databases aren't that bad actually.For your projects consider this:* ACID vs. eventual consistency* Strict schema vs. schemaless design* Decent/good scalability vs. (almost) unlimitted scalabilityEach of these is a trade-off that has consequences for the code you write. You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.Traditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of \"safety\" and strict reliability for clean data.NoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of \"guarantees\" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from \"eventual consistency\" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.Relational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.NoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.Paradoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like. But as soon as you do more complex queries you need to know **exactly** how you're going to access your data.",

The scalability alone is amazing. Being able to spin up a three server cluster with quorum, active/active scenario with load balancing and fault tolerance in a few properties in a docker compose file is really, really awesome. Try to do that with any other SQL manager - good luck.There's a catch though, you don't have the safety the schema is giving you. So you must be EXTRA careful when you change the schema of your database. We abide by the following rules : \\* A collection only holds one type of document \\* If we add a field to a document, we must add it to every existing object in the database \\* If there's a relationship, materialize it with a foreign key ( basically, \\_id)Just following those 3 rules got us really far with a very homogenous and reliable DB, so much that we are transitioning to supporting both SQL and no-SQL - we want to offer an on-premise version of our app, hence using the customer's favorite DB. The transition is proving to be pretty much trivial so far - thanks to our rules and us using abstraction ( i.e. LinQ in C# mostly), which makes our query translate 1-1 in others DBMS.But really, the cluster capabilities of Mongo is the key point in our choice.",

You'll rarely need a NoSQL database. Sometimes you use both for different aspects of an application.For someone just learning (no specific project in mind), focus on building excellent relational database skills first. Then if you want to learn NoSQL the top document stores are probably MongoDB or Couchbase. Top key-value stores are probably Redis, DynamoDB, and Riak. You've also got graph databases like Neo4j. I'd probably play around with a little of all of them first so if the time comes in your job where you're told to use one, you'll at least know the basics of them and the on-the-job learning curve won't be so steep.",

Their teaching is wonderful for creating a solid foundation.

No one is good at reading documentation. For that you just have to force yourself to read it line by line and then summarise each paragraph to yourself to help cement the information in that paragraph. I especially struggle with pushing myself to learn more, but because I’m aware of it, I can now push myself to work on correcting it. It sounds like you probably know what your weaknesses are, your best way to fix it is to find a way to build your confidence in those skills. You very likely know more than you realise and just need to find a way to change your mindset. It’s pretty common to struggle with this but if you’re looking to specialise in something focus on what you enjoy and just branch out from there. Good luck!

If somebody asks me to do something don't know anything about I just tell them \"hey, I don't have experience on that but I'd be super keen to learn.\"Thats a very respected response, because it means that you care enough about the end result to not make more work for other people. A surprisingly uncommon attitude.To be honest I think you're suffering a little from imposter syndrome. You have a fairly broad base of knowledge and I would imagine you can develop the skills required as needed.In any trade skill or otherwise, you're not expected to know everything. If you gave me a Bugatti, I would be lost. Its a piece of machinery sure, but not one I'm familiar with. I can definitely learn to work on them given opportunities. Same applies to you. You're not expected to know everything. Good luck out there friend :)",

In reality, companies rarely use the latest hot thing and may be on tech stacks years or decades old. If you've learned the current tech you need, you'll be able to pick up new tech.If anything, consider job hunting. With your experience you're probably pretty valuable and could probably find a job where you have more responsibility for more pay and can work in a new environment with new technologies. Just remember that the tech stack you're working within is one small part of whatever job you have. Don't forget to strongly consider the quality of the people you're working with, the impact of your work, etc.",

For the right projects you can indeed do it all.I would look for a job or training place where you can be humble and ask the right questions: Ok, if I do this it works: But why? Would this be a true alternative? I believe that is better: Do you agree?But that implies that you have a job, where they no only push you as much as possible to get the most as possible.Maybe you need to find such a complex problem, that your current methods really do not work anymore. On another note: if you are overwhelmed when learning or digging deep: I often feel, that I should not invest that much time in that problem; that I should take a short cut to an easy way out.If you have similar experiences: make learning/understanding/contemplating your explicit goal for a set amount of time. Instead of finishing the project in 2h try to understand the aspect of the framework you are using for 3h and then finish the project in another 2h. During those 3h you might be able to calm your brain away from its “must finish project now” thoughts.",

On top of that, we didn’t have AI tools back then to help explain concepts step-by-step like we do now.Honestly, a lot of the time I felt lost, especially since many professors kind of checked out or weren’t available. StackOverflow became my lifeline. There were so many moments when I was stuck and had no one to ask, so I had to figure things out on my own.About AI — I think it’s important to understand that AI doesn’t just solve the problem for you or give you the perfect answer every time. Instead, it helps guide you toward the solution, giving you hints or a direction to think in. At the end of the day, it’s still you who needs to understand the problem, connect the dots, and come up with the real answer.That guidance is incredibly valuable, especially when you feel overwhelmed or stuck. But relying solely on AI without building your own understanding won’t get you far. I think being aware of that balance — using AI as a tool, but still doing the hard thinking yourself — is what makes a real difference.So, hang in there. The fact that you’re reflecting on this and want to improve means you’re already on the right path. We all had shaky starts, but what matters is how we keep moving forward. You’ve got this!",

If you don’t work in an environment where you design the code the architecture and so on those are useless skills as long as you are paid to ship products and the how doesn’t really matter in most cases as much as the end product. In regards to your own abilities yes some jobs are really really bad as they will not develop good skills but force you to compromise on it. My advise will be to focus on that back end structure and architecture that you said you are loving and have smal windows where you either ask chat got to explain to you things like you were a beginner and they are your pair programming partner and so on or you find communities of people that share the same interest. For example you could start mentoring junior developers and have them contribute to your own back end small to medium and later expert api designs while implementing all the testing strategies and so on. It doesn’t matter if that direction is provided by chat got as long as you explain that to someone else as it’s coming from you as the one you explain to will struggle to understand or follow and you need to constantly repeat yourself hence learning the subject as you teach it. Pair programming is very good and the practice of small iterative steps while using git hub and commits push and pull requests with branching is an amazing collaborative tool to provide knowledge for yourself and for the mentored pupil. This will make both your GitHub’s active and it shows consistency. Setup the backend repo make a snap quick dummy - trace the steps and then delete it and provide the same from scratch to your newbie taking it slow explaining everything like he has no clue - which he won’t anyway - forcing you to explain your code differently even though you have an idea what it means. Encourage them to ask questions and focus on interacting instead of building. Follow the driver navigator pattern and make sure you stay within the roles themselves both the beginner and you and then switch after either functions being made or later features depending on the project itself. There is more to it on the aspect of self development here but I won’t get into that either as I’m writing too mi ha but find an actual person that works on backend and ask for being mentored by them as well. This will provide you with both as a mentee and mentor experience and will help you develop your skills in no time compared to what you doing. Focus on finding solutions together other than shipping a solution. Enjoy",

If you want the \"thorough\" treatment of C, then King's C Programming: A Modern Approach is better.Beej's Guide to C is OK-ish, but I don't think it's as good as his Guide to Network Programming. I would recommend a different book if you are a beginner to C. Beej's Guide is useful if you want to see explanations of new C features like #embed or #include , but a major weaknesses for new learners are that there are no \"student exercises\". I suppose you could invent some on your own, but it's a sign of a good book that good, well-thought-out exercises are given at each stage that help you \"level up\" at each chapter, to help you slowly build up your \"rpgramming muscles\" as it were. Both K&R's book and King's book do that very effectively. In fact for the classic K&R book there is also a separate book called The C Answer Book where solutions are given. But in order to get the most out of such exercises, you should first try your own solutions yourself before reading another answer.Also, I noticed you have no book which specifically mentions assembly language. If you want to learn low level, then you need at least a passing familiarity with Assembly, in my opinion, e.g. x86, x86\\_64, ARM, or all of them. If you learn one architecture, then learning another is not as hard.",

Learn everything you can about installing and maintaining a Linux system. RHCSA is good, but not needed. Learn Docker and Kubernetes. Learn a cloud service like AWS or Azure. Most importantly, always be ready to learn. I did all that and applied to a DevOps/Sys Admin role. The company I applied to also needed intern product developer role. I volunteered for that. Did a 6 month internship. Pretty weird to be an intern as a 34 year old, but I’d like to think I killed it there. They made me a permanent employee on June 1st and I’m loving it. I suppose being a bit older than a regular intern motivated me to put my best foot forward. I volunteered to do things no one else wanted to. Learned a lot in the process.

I’ve been in a similar boat, where the hands-on stuff takes priority, but then you start hitting roadblocks in interviews or realizing there are gaps in your understanding of core concepts.First off, don’t beat yourself up too much. You’ve already got a solid understanding of how to get things done in real-world scenarios, which is a huge plus. The next step is just filling in those gaps in theory and fundamentals.One option could be looking into free or low-cost online resources. There are a ton of high-quality materials out there. Sites like Coursera, edX, or freeCodeCamp offer courses that dive into algorithms, data structures, and other core topics. If you're feeling motivated enough to try something more structured, CS50 from Harvard is an amazing free intro to computer science.Another suggestion is tackling coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. They’ll help you get comfortable with algorithmic thinking and test your understanding of fundamental concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and graph theory. It can be tough at first, but it’s a great way to get that theory-practice balance.As for motivation, maybe set up a study routine that combines theory with practical application—like, for example, learn a concept in theory, then solve problems related to it. It’ll help you connect the dots and see the real-world value of what you're learning.In terms of classes, I’d say if you're going to invest in them, a well-structured, affordable course from places like Udemy or Pluralsight might give you more value for your money. They offer structured paths that are more flexible than community college but still provide that sense of accountability.",

Very close to a recipe in a cookbook, but structured so even the \"stupidest\" reader would be able to follow.I honestly don't get why so many seem to struggle with it - maybe it is because they are required to use LaTeX, where pseudocode is literally a language with very specific syntactical rules, and it is truly a pain to format anything in it ... Because otherwise pseudocode is just intended to ignore syntax rules, specific keywords and built in library functions - just write what the program should do!The few times I've met students that claimed they didn't understand pseudocode, it wasn't because they didn't understand pseudocode, it was because they didn't understand the algorithm or the program they were supposed to write. At least not on any level of abstraction above the actual code (which was most likely written by someone else, copied from the web, or generated by AI).Maybe students should try to write pseucocode for each other, and implement solutions that someone else wrote the pseudocode for ... And maybe teachers should stop requiring students to \"code\" in LaTeX pseudocode-languages!",

Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Including diagrams, emojis, whatever, doesn't matter.

Still readable. It even has comments!And here, here's one with emojis, still perfectly good pseudocode```pythonDefine fizzbuzz(i): If 15 perfectly divides i then return :beer_mug::honeybee: Else if 3 perfectly divides i then return :beer_mug: Else if 5 perfectly divides i then return :honeybee: Else return iDefine apply_fizzbuzz(numbers): Return map fizzbuzz over numbersCall apply_fizzbuzz on range 1 to 100Print each result```So yeah.. just do your own thing!",

Obviously you will be missing out on supplemental things, like exercises and book references that might be related to the lectures, but you can always just stop the lecture when they are about to shift topics, if you feel like there's soemthing missing, go and dig a little bit further into that topic, before you continue with the lecture to the next topic :b Lectures are however quite time-consuming. It's for a good reason, you don't build up your intuition and understanding without spending time, so it requires your dedication.

        "body": "I would say pick a programming language and just dive into the basics! I would say Python is a very great one to start - it's syntax is quite readable, it's easier to use than many other languages, and yet it will certainly get you into the \"flow\" with how to think about how to solve programming type problems.I would 100% recommend coding along to a YouTube channel, namely BroCode (his videos and teaching style are amazing). There are also some great sites like CodeCademy that have guided practice / learning sessions - these would probably be more than enough to teach you the fundamental terms you'll want to familiiarize yourself with.More than anything, it is \\*totally\\* normal to feel lost. Just remember that you do not need to understand all of a certain language or anything (nobody does!), and that you can go quite far with the fundamental building blocks of most programming (like variables, functions, loops, and conditionals). Although there tends to be \"better\" ways to do things and \"worse\" ways to do things, there are TONS of solutions to the same problem in programming, perhaps more so than many other fields. Just to clarify - GitHub is basically a platform for storing and sharing code projects, especially when multiple people are working together. It's more of a tool for managing and collaborating on code rather than a place to learn programming itself. That's probably why you felt so lost there!In any case, try to have fun as you learn!",

If you make a change where you later find out something broke, you can always revert back to the commit where you know everything worked.Of course there is still lots of room for improvement here with proper branching strategies. But to start off, this is better than nothing.**Tests:**In your case, I would really suggest writing integration or end to end tests. Ignore unit tests completely.All you want to know is that broadly speaking, your feature set works as intended. Caring about every single unit of code is not where you're at.[Test bahavior, not implementation details](https://codeling.dev/blog/testing-behavior-or-implementation/) which will tell you immediately if any of your features break and makes refactoring code much less risky and certainly less of a pain in the a$$.**Where to start:**Since you're really concerned about existing working features breaking when you change something, I would really suggest writing a few tests for the most important features.Maybe start working in version control when you feel you're up to it,...but at least start with a few end to end or integration tests which focus on behavior. It's easier than you think,....and actually quite fun,...and makes you feel safe making changes or new features.",

I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. Algorithms typically employ a type of math called discrete math, and understanding it is crucial to understanding algorithms; but you also need to understand programming principles. A lot of discrete math is, unlike the higher-level continuous math in a CS curriculum, much more intuitive. It is much more logical and “common sensical” than, say, divergence of a series. Sorting a list or traversing a tree, for instance, often just makes sense without delving too deeply into the underlying mathematics. You should be focusing more on the data structures themselves than deep diving into the theory at this point. There are many clever tricks used in DSA problems (I’ve always liked the sliding window problem), but this is more about creative problem-solving than applying mathematical foundations. Having a theoretical understanding of DSAs will not get you far there. Mathematical *reasoning* is much more important here. Outside of a few fields such as data science, the most math you’ll use is probably basic statistics and algebra, and perhaps discrete math such as bit-wise logic and graph theory. Ideally, however, if you’re struggling with simple syntax and concepts, you shouldn’t be too focused on *any* of the math yet. If you’re not understanding conditionals, loops, logic, and native data structures, you shouldn’t skip to DSAs, since the foundation of data structures and algorithms lies within those rudimentary concepts. You should be able to solve basic to intermediate problems before DSAs. If you can’t write a program to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit or find the factorial of an integer, then you need to revisit the fundamentals.",

They're also more advanced tools, so if you're not using the basic tools, it makes it even tougher.My best advice would be to get coding. Reps to get comfortable with the syntax, and going from idea to functional. When you're stuck, talk to AI and tell it you don't want the answer, but to help it tutor you. You have this problem, you're here, and you got this error. Ask it to help you step through the code to identify where the error happens. Ask it to help identify few different possible avenues that may cause an error that you should look to check, and how to prove if that is or isn't where the problem is.Next I would take on studying big O. You want to understand how optimized your code is. If you rewrote the same code using a hashmap or array, which would be better? why? In all scenarios? Big O helps you understand efficiency.Once you understand that, then DSA comes into play. A lot of DSA is purely conceptual. The code looks similar to other code with if statements and some variables. I've also seen most DSA just use an array to accomplish it, so it makes it even more confusing. If they're just using an array, why add all the the complexity?Some problems, that are not even that hard of a concept to understand, are tricky to code efficiently.

Even if the teacher is explaining things, and you feel like you kind of get it in the moment, that's never enough. You managed to complete your assignments before the DS&A class, so you've obviously written some code that solves problems based off the learning material and your ability to google the rest, but what you should have been doing is spending some extra time with each assignment after you finished it making sure you understand the code you've written. This could involve things like messing with the code and seeing what happens, or coming up with your own slight variation on the problem and solving that. It could involve asking other students about how they solved the problem (after it's been submitted, and without seeing their code), or discussing things with them (again, without sharing code) while working on it. If there is time to ask questions during class, make sure you ask them when you're unsure about something. If your teacher has office hours, make use of that. You don't have to learn entirely on your own, but you do have to be willing to recognize when you're not getting something and take the initiative.What you need for DS&A above all else is a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming. What I mean is understanding how things like loops, conditionals, variables, and functions combine together to create specific behavior in your program. And I don't mean at a conceptual level, I mean understanding it deeply enough that you can actually write programs that solve problems on your own (this does not mean without looking up functions or syntax, but it does mean knowing roughly what you're looking for). Without that, you are woefully unprepared for DS&A.even a solid understanding of discrete mathematics alone would not get you through a DS&A class, because in the end your assignments will be primarily implementing specific data structures or algorithms, and while that math certainly helps, it doesn't magically make you able to write code on your own. It only helps you understand what you're writing.The only way you develop this knowledge is through practice. You need to sit down, and actually try to solve problems with code enough that you actually develop a feel for how to use the tools you've been taught.Here's an analogy. Let's compare learning to program with learning woodworking. Following along line by line is like the teacher explaining each tool, giving you a complete blueprint, and then telling you *exactly* how to make that specific thing out of your wood. Sure, you came out the end with something that more or less resembles what the teacher showed you how to make. But that alone is not going to teach you the nuance about how to actually get a nice straight cut, what steps to take to go from a block of wood to the piece you need, what order to take those steps, or any of the nuance involved with using each tool. Those are all things you develop through experience actually using the tools.College expects you to be smart enough to recognize when you are not actually understanding things. It also expects you to be willing and able to learn on your own.I want to be clear, I'm not trying to say you're completely screwed. What I'm saying is that what you've been doing up until now is simply not enough. You need to devote more time and effort into actually learning the material properly. If you are in a position where you absolutely cannot Devore the necessary time and effort into learning the material, them maybe you need to take some time off, self learn during that time, and come back later to finish things.Consider this: can you write a basic text based program that plays rock paper scissors against the user? If you think you can, go write it. Try the same with tic tac toe. Writing the code to check if someone has won a game of tic tac toe is an algorithm, albeit one with a single very specific application.If you don't think you are capable of writing those, then you need to sit down and figure out how. You have at least learned all the necessary building blocks to put together to make those programs by now. It's up to you to spend the time playing with those blocks and finding out what ways you can put them together that makes those programs.If you don't even know where to start, don't think about code at all. Think about the steps a program would have to go through, and write them down in plain English, or in pseudocode. Once you have the basic structure of what that looks like, think about how you might convert each step into code. If a step seems too complex, try breaking it up into smaller steps, then try to convert each of those.The idea here is that before you actually write code, you should understand at a conceptual level what your program should roughly look like. Not the fine details, just a rough outline. Once you've come up with a rough idea of what your program looks like, then you know enough to actually try to write it. If you just jump in and try to write code without some idea of what your program should look like, chances are you'll have no clue where to even begin, or you'll just flail about trying to randomly slap different ideas together until you get something that works.",

Etc.YOU have to go answer all these, but you can start with a simple one. Maybe for the first version you simply get a local file playing. Then next version you allow the user to pause & resume it. Then toggle between two files, etc.IMO it’s better to start with a very simple project then build slightly more complex ones as you learn.",

You have many options available: pseudocode, UML, other various diagrams, etc.What I typically do is just break down all the requirements in a text file, then separate that into class diagrams. Once I have the core classes logic figured out for the most part, I start programming by building all of my files, e.g. .h, .cpp, etc.Create the classes & methods in each file with a bunch of TODO's breaking down what each method/class should do. Lots of inline comments. And then from there I start at where the program starts, e.g. if there's 1 class handling the core algorithm and another handling the user interface which has-a relationship with the other class, meaning it's functionality is dependent upon the other, then I start working with the core class first and build out the methods.",

I'm guessing such files have some metadata other than music, parse this and print it.* ...* make the program make a sound in the easiest possible way.* stream the music file to sound device. You now have a music player.* if it should have a gui, start with printing \"music player\" in a window.* next, present some of the meta data in the window.* etc.",

Do them even if you don't know what the fuck your doing cuz that's how you learn by not knowing. Also find some online courses for the foundational stuff (Data structures and algorithms) then make a goal to make something with each structure that's impactful in your life. Like a todo list using stacks and queues or something simple. I'm working on a simple crud integrated with mysql in order to keep track of important information such as my credit cards, debit cards, and addresses and previous phone numbers and such. Get on github and program something once a day, the heatmap that shows what you've done is a wonderful motivation tool and a great way to start keeping track of where you fucked up and how you learned from your fuck up. And don't be afraid to look at other peoples code, it opens your mind to other possible solutions for the things you want to build or optimize.",

Development is changing, and even though I believe there will be developers for many years to come, we can mark that as 'less certain' at least than cybersecurity at current moment. ML/AI is evolving and who knows what awaits, also this field relies on math heavily(vibe coding not so much:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:) so you should have certain affinities to pursue it long term.That being said, I am always a fan of go with what you like the most approach, because that tends to be the recipe for long term success IMO, keep yourself interested and motivated because IT world is always evolving, change is kinda part of the job...And if you pivot later on, you didn't lose anything, you just gained a different perspective.",

All three that you mentioned are future proof. The web isn't going anywhere, same for AI, and cybersecurity will only keep growing. So, no matter which you choose, you will have job opportunities. Think about which one interests you the most.What I did was research all of them. AI/ML takes a lot of data science, it's basically fancy statistics and a lot of math. I researched data science and it just didn't interest me, so I skipped it. Same for mobile development, it just didn't interest me as much as backend software development. So, I decided to just stick to backend development as my main path.Something to keep in mind is that you don't have to stick to one career. You can make a career change 7 years after getting your first job and go into AI or Cybersecurity or anything you like. You don't have to do one thing, you can grow into different things. So, think about it. Which one do you like the most now and which one would you like to do in the future?",

So being \"dependent on the .NET framework\" is like being \"dependent on Chrome to provide the browser DOM APIs\".

Number one is that you shouldn't just complain, but show solutions. Document what problems you're having, how you can solve them in the current framework (or why you cant), and what a better path forward would be.Executives don't care if a problem is hard, they care about cost and hours. If it takes less hours or money to solve a big problem a new way, that's how you get traction. Translate hours of work to cost and you'll be speaking a language they understand.",

        "body": "You need to start managing this project by capturing the business requirements and tracking how long it takes you to deliver them.The temptation is to just work on features as quickly as you can, to the best of your ability, and try to hit the deadlines set by your manager. *Don't do this: it's a recipe for burn-out and failure*.Instead, you need to plan your work up front, calculate how long it will take, and manage the business's expectations accordingly. You're a junior, and your working alone, so you need to give yourself time to do the necessary research and to correct the inevitable mistakes you'll make along the way.Businesses like *certainty*. They are less concerned with *how long* things take; they want to know *when* they will be ready so that they can plan accordingly. Your job is to give yourself enough time to deliver your work to an acceptable standard, to tell your manager *when* things will be complete, and to warn your manager *when* they will be late *as soon as you are able to*.Below is an outline of how to do this effectively: You have some high-level requirements already. Break those requirements down into units of work that deliver business value. We'll call those units features. The features need to be as small as they can be, such that completing one delivers some value to the business, even if it isn't usable in isolation.As an example, imagine you need to implement user accounts so that people can log onto the system and use it. The complete set of features that make a complete working implementation might be the following:- Registration- Login- Reset password- Update credentialsAll of these can be delivered as separate features. Even though registration is useless without login (and vice versa), they can be developed independently and each add business value independent of the other, so they count as separate features.The reason we try to make features small in this way is that it makes them closer to each other in size; therefore the time it takes to complete any of them will be of a similar magnitude. This will be important later.Once you have a collection of such features, you can begin working on them. As you work on them, you want to set aside some time in your week to plan the next set of requirements while you deliver the first.It's up to you to find the right balance between planning and delivery. Basically you want to be delivering as much as possible, but doing enough planning that you always have something in the backlog to work on. You want to make sure you capture all the requirements in the planning phase.You should have a nice predictable cadence to your work. You begin a task and you work on it until it is done. If you have to stop half way through a task because you failed to capture a business requirement, or failed to predict a technical problem, this is an indication that you didn't do enough prep work. We call these issues *blockers*. They happen to everyone - even experienced devs - but they will become rare if you are able to identify and fix their cause.You should keep a record of the features you're working on somewhere. It could be a Trello board, a GitHub project, a spreadsheet, a list in your diary, post-it notes - it doesn't matter where it lives. What matters is that you move features from the backlog to *in-progress* while you're working on them, and then into *done*, when you complete them; *and crucially*, you need to record *when* you completed them. Tools like Trello do this automatically for you.Once you have completed some features, you will have some real knowledge of how long it takes to complete a feature. Let's say you complete 5 features over a 2 week period. That means you have a velocity of *2 days per feature*. *Now* you can predict how long it will take you to complete the remaining features. As you complete more features, your velocity will become more accurate. Maybe by the end of the month, it turns out that it takes 2.5 days to complete a feature. Feed that back into your predictions.If you break your features down into small units of business value, like I outlined above, you will reduce the margin of error in the prediction. Realistically, some features will be completed sooner than others, but it all averages out over time.You can also use your velocity to make long-term predictions. If you count the average number of features that make up a high-level requirement (let's call it an \"epic\") then you can get a rough estimate of how long it will take to deliver an epic.Don't *guess* how long a feature will take to complete. You'll just get it wrong, but you'll still be obligated to achieve the deadline you set for yourself just the same. Use the velocity to *predict* how long it will take to complete your features, and keep updating that velocity. It's a good idea to put a couple of days on the end of the prediction in any case, to give yourself some wiggle room if anything goes wrong.Initially, you won't have a velocity. Tell your manager that you'll give him an estimate just as soon as you've completed a few features. If he really needs an estimate now, give him your best estimate, but update it as soon as you have a velocity, and update it again every time that velocity changes.Sometimes businesses actually do have deadlines they need to meet. Once you're tracking your progress effectively, you have the means to tell your manager if those deadlines are realistic. If you can see that you aren't going to deliver all the features required for a deadline, you and your manager need to negotiate what you're going to do about it. You're likely to have one of 5 options:1. Move the deadline;2. Remove features;3. Hire another developer;4. Work overtime;5. Cut some corners.4 and 5 are real options, but they are riskier, and they need to be managed carefully. If you're going to work overtime, you ought to be getting paid overtime, and you'll also need to take a holiday afterwards to recover your energy. There is also the issue of whether or not you *want* to be the one making all the sacrifices, and whether or not your company is taking advantage of you.If you're going to cut corners, you need to fix-up your work as soon after the deadline as possible. Time needs to be set aside for this and future deadlines may need to be delayed. This is called *paying back your technical debt* and failing to do so can ultimately sink a project.Along with features, you're also going to have to perform other tasks, such as bug fixes, refactors, meetings, and so on. You only need to track product facing tasks (i.e. features and bugs), but you can track other things as well if it helps you organise and manage your workload.Bugs are an important dimension to measure. Together with velocity, they give you a real measure of the success of your project, and some actual quantitative data to share with you manager. (Managers love data.)You can track bugs on the same board, but track them separately, and *don't include them in the velocity*; that's for features only. More bugs will usually coincide with a reduction in velocity, and both trends mean that you need to fix some underlying issue with your code. Maybe it needs refactoring, better linting, or more unit tests. Maybe it's outgrown its architecture. They're an indication that you're either delivering too quickly and neglecting the quality of your code, or have some limitation in your architecture that you need to overcome.You need to pay attention to what is causing these issues because it will help you inform decision you make about the project going forward. E.g. have you finally outgrown those Google Sheets? Or, are you spending enough time keeping your code tidy.Again, all of this is intended to help you make room for yourself to improve the parts of your project your manager won't see and ultimately doesn't care about unless they produce a failure (which they will if they go unchecked) while providing the velocity that shows predictable progress. You need to give yourself room to try unit testing, or some library that you need, or whatever it is you think the project needs.Don't hide these kinds of data for fear of being criticised. You can use them to demonstrate why you need the things that you know you need.",

As the only IT employee in the \"company\", you are the definitive source of what is possible though. Assuming you want to continue in this role (I'd give that some thought...might be best just to move on...it's a stupid structure that you are the only IT person....)...You need to learn to speak their language and tell them when what they want is unrealistic without calling them a-holes. \"We need to manage expectations here.\"",

Proper design, performance and maintainability comes later in the learning curve. Syntax, the algorithm and the availavle libraries are the main focus here.2. Can I make this secure? Know the most common attack vectors and how to mitigate them. Don't settle for \"just use library X\". Understand the principle what the issue is and how it can be exploited. Then use the library.3. Can I fix performance bottlenecks. Learn profiling techniques and caching for starters.Now you've hit the milestone that you can deliver usable software. It might not be pretty but it works and is secured against most common attack vectors.4. Can I deliver fast? Time is money and to be competive you must learn to deliver quicker. Tooling, frameworks ai come into play here. Optimize your workflow for quicker results5. Can the software adapt to changes quickly? The main goal of software maintainability is to be able to adapt to changing requirements. New market oppertunities, chaning legel requirements. Compitive software can be changed quickly. Learn common patterns and practices. Learn about software architecture for differnt levels of scale.At this point your technical skills are what I would expect of a senior developer.Now I just ask myself the question. Can I make X?If the answer is no I follow these 5 steps and expand my knowledge for each step where needed. It looks like you are expanding your skills in step 1 and you have dabbled a bit in the others. Good. Now look at your work from the perspective of the other points. Detect issues, find and assess the solutions. Train yourself on the tooling surrounding those solutions and voila, your skillset has expanded. Rinse and repeat.It's not about learning, it's about building.Build. Build better.Build bigger.",

It is a deliberatly insecure webshop and you're challenged to hack it. \"Owasp cheat sheet series\" is comprehensive list of common security flaws the help je get started. Youtube has videos of people doing the challanges.Once you get through that you should have solid foundation to judge your own code for security flaws.Owasp also has a list of tooling that can assist in testing for security flaws.For performance you optimize the bottlenecks and leave the rest. Learn about caching and some basic database optimization.Step 4. I believe that editor/ide configuration is highly personal. Try different stuff and do what is right for you. Optimize whats slows you down.Step 5. Is best if you have a solid fundation on step 1. Read up on design patterns, soft architecture patterns. At this point you should have buily enough stuff to understand where you could use that stuff effectively.",

First, you need to learn the \"alphabet\" of programming such as variables, loops, functions, algorithms and other basic concepts that are applicable to any programming language. Then you need to learn idioms for the programming language of choice, e.g., object-oriented programming for C++ or trait-oriented programming for Rust, as well as the standard library for that programming language with basic string operations and so on. Then, finally, you need to learn the chosen problem domain, such as blockchain API and smart contract API.That's a lot of material and that's why a proper Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science takes 4 years. I rarely see a programmer who writes maintainable, usable code with less than 2 - 3 years of experience. Five years of experience is the minimum to be able to build serious, larger systems without constant supervision.My advice: don't waste too much time on passive, video-based courses. If you want to get good at something, learn by doing. Learn a topic and start solving specific exercises for that topic using a specific programming language, hands-on.",

I think deliberate practice is a pretty undervalued method of learning in this field, and I would recommend that you apply it to your learning process. Other than that focus on learning and understanding the concepts and tools deeply. If you know what concept you need to apply to get some problem solved, you can always look up the syntax how to do so.For example; You want to parse json data from the APIYou would need to use \"encoding/json\" for converting that json data to a \"programmable format\" called parsing. To do that you need to know concepts like parsing, json unmarshalling/marshalling, learning what even API means etc. You don't need a deep understanding of these concepts first and I think they can be learned by doing projects and then asking chatGPT or fellow humans for assistance when you hit a roadblock or need further explanation. When you do project based learning you will encounter many points, in which you have to dive deep into the inner workings of a computer to get past something or after you are done building for the day, you can further your understanding on some new concepts that you encountered/applied. Basics can be drilled by practicing for loops, if statements, variable declarations, playing around with data structures like looping over them, learning some basic searching and sorting algorithms and then diving deeper into paradigms and how to identify some of the key patterns found in some of the problems.",

They help you get your bearings, but they shouldn’t replace reading the source docs when it matters. So if reading docs feels boring, you can try to use tools to support your learning, break things into smaller chunks, build while you read, and permit yourself to skim when you need to. Just don’t skip the reading entirely, there’s a lot of value in it once your brain has some hands-on context to tie it to.",

        "body": "There are people who like the unknown and there are people who like the known. Those who like the known are those who prefer to live in a town where they are close to relatives and friends. The idea of going some place new where you have to make new friends is scary. Others will hop on a plane and decide to wander the Earth with no particular plan except to explore. They believe they will manage somehow. One is driven more by fear, and the other is driven by lack of fear.Anyway, it sounds like you want reassurances to make sure you know every step of the way where others would just jump in and do. You're probably concerned \"what if I get stuck and don't know what to do next\". You want someone to help you out. People may help, and that's great, but realizing that, ultimately, you have to look out for yourself is an important life skill. I myself fall into the category of wanting to know how I will do things ahead of time.But, let's just go through some of your questions.**What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?**Try not to worry about the time frame. The course is set up for ten weeks, but this is a Harvard course and as a college course, it's pretty aggressive to finish so quickly. I would budget twice the time, maybe twenty weeks which is about 5 months, but take all the time you need. You don't have to race to the answer. You may feel like you have to be efficient, but expect to be slow, and don't pressure yourself to move faster because you'll likely skip information you need by trying to \"keep up\".**How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?**You've only given yourself 5 weeks. You are unlikely to finish unless you are either smart or cheat (you may think using ChatGPT is not cheating, but it is). The class already takes ten weeks for Harvard students, and you want to do it in half the time. Spending lots of hours, esp. on academic topics, is not always productive. There's this joke that goes \"if it takes 9 months for a woman to have a baby, then it should take 9 women 1 month each to have a baby\" which means that you can't speed up certain things. I mean, if you can spend that time and not go brain dead, then good for you. Give it a try. But most people find it hard to focus for more than about 3 hours a day. If you try for more, you'll need a break, and you'll have to be making some progress during that time.You might get through the C coding part if you happen to be quick (so 5 weeks).**How does submission of problem sets and projects work?**I think you need to read this and figure it out. It is a bit elaborate involving using Github and setting that up. Harvard doesn't want to be in business of managing user accounts. There are instructions on how to do this. I would say, outside of the actual programming itself, it's this part that's kind of annoying. You just have to follow the steps carefully, that's all. I would probably suggest using their version of Visual Studio Code (assuming they still use it).**Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?**You'll be instructed how to do this. This is the kind of question that suggest apprehension on your part. Read it, dig in, and figure it out. It's a useful skill to be able to work through problems.**Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!**The problem sets (which are the programming assignments) are challenging. I've taught intro programming and I would likely not give that level of difficulty to a class. In particular, CS50x uses more math than the projects I used to assign. Also, some projects are considered notoriously challenging. One is called Tideman. Usually, they have an easier version of the project and a harder one. You might opt to do the easier one.One reason Tideman is challenging is the length of the description of what to do. Beyond that, it's hard to visualize the arrays to place the data. If C were object-oriented, it might be easier to understand (though still not easy).Expect it to be challenging. Don't worry if you don't complete the course in a month. You're expecting a lot, maybe too much. Any progress would be considered good. Try not to be disappointed if you only get through, say, 3 weeks of the course in the time allotted. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed.Anyway, good luck. Hope you get done as much as you plan, but even if you don't you took some initiative which is a positive attitude.",

Being too careless sucks, being too careful sucks. Really good advice, specially because it might pass as \"obvious\" for some people.Other than that, a good guiding comment on how to tackle CS50. I did most of the course's problems (Didn't make the final one, so no certificate to show) and even though I already had some experience with C(just as a student, I don't have any professional experience), Tideman gave me a few hours of thinking and stressing over. The course is indeed challenging and it brushes over some of topics that will require more studying if you want a better understanding, such as data structures and algorithms, how memory works and so on.Not OP, but thank you for the comment and willingness to share your experience in depth.",

More practically: imagine that these questions aren't created in code as part of an exercise/test but are simply read from a database. and another tool is used to insert the questions into the database. So as a programmer you have no idea how many questions there are or how to name them.It makes a lot more sense to simply throw them into a list (the list of questions). In your case because you run into exercises and example code, often people want to show you things you'll encounter in later life but run into the problem that doing the setup for these sorts of systems would distract you from the thing they are trying to teach. So they compromise.Personally I would find it better to use a function that returns the questions (in your case). the function will return a list of questions and you can add in comments / naming of the function that it represents a lookup from file or database. that way you can practice working with abstractions / accepting data comes from another location (without needing to know exactly how it is put together)",

        "body": "In Python, `super()` and `Class.__init__()` are related to how inheritance works.In the first example where you use `super().__init__(side, side)`, `super()` is a special function that refers to the parent class in the method resolution order (MRO). When you call `super().__init__(side, side)`, it’s essentially telling Python to look up the inheritance chain and call the `__init__` method of the parent class (which in this case is `Rectangle`). This allows the `Square` class to inherit and use the initialization logic of the `Rectangle` class without explicitly referencing `Rectangle` by name. When `super().__init__(side, side)` is called, it sets the `height` and `width` attributes of the `Square` instance (which is `s`), because `super()` is calling `Rectangle.__init__` internally and passing the values to it.Now, in the second example, `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)` does something similar but directly. You’re calling the `__init__` method of the `Rectangle` class explicitly. Here, `Rectangle.__init__` sets the `height` and `width` attributes on the `Square` instance (`s`) in the same way, but this time, you’re directly referencing the parent class.In both cases, the key point is that calling `__init__` on a class (whether via `super()` or directly) will set up the attributes of the instance. When you do `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)`, it sets `self.height` and `self.width` on the `Square` instance, just as if the `Square` class was directly calling `Rectangle`'s `__init__` method.The reason this works, even though `Rectangle` is a class, is because `Rectangle.__init__` is a method that belongs to the class and can be called just like any other method. The instance (`self` in `Square`) is passed along, so it has access to the attributes defined within the method.",

All classes in python return objects when instanciated. `super()` returns what the documentation calls a \"proxy object\".https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#superProxy objects are special. They are bound to a type and an instance of a type. When any method is called on them, they search the [method-resolution-order (MRO)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) for this combination, and call that instead.The actual call signature of `super`:```super(type, object_or_type)```Takes these 2 arguments. Usually, `type` is a class, `object_or_type` is an instance of that class. When called without argument but directly followed by a method call, these arguments default to the enclosing class and the calling instance.Therefore, let's break down what happens in the case you described:> super is a class therefore super().__init__(side, side) should create instance of the class super1. `super()` returns a proxy object, bound to the type `` and the current instance of that class2. `.__init__` tells the proxy object: \"Search the MRO for this instance of this class 'upwards' for a method called `__init__`\"3. The search determines that the method to call is `Rectangle.__init__`4. `(side, side)` now calls `Rectangle.__init__` with `side` as the value for both arguments",

My path was working through that, then playing with some Rust just for fun, and because of that I was given side projects at work, and eventually became an actual software dev. I don't use Rust, I definitely don't use Ruby. But none the less, the skills transferred over. Keep in mind, though, as u/iamjacob97 said, you have to practice. The downfall to reading too much is that everything makes sense as you read it, but, you're not really getting it. You just feel like you are. Then, you finish the book thinking you have a great understanding of the language the book covered, and programming in general, and start to write something and your mind will just blank out on you.

Learn C (great book: https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/C%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition%20(OCR).pdf) -- do practice problems, write a few programs to understand how programs are written and execute on your computer2. Learn some computer architecture -- helps you understand what your CPU is doing and the purpose of a GPU3. You should have spent A LOT of time on doing steps 1 and 2, so it depends what you want to do from here. The two most common applications: 3a. If you're interested in programming on a GPU for AI reasons, then study what kind of math operations are performed for most deep learning applications (e.g., matrix multiplication). 3b. If you want to do something related to graphics, start with something like OpenGL (https://learnopengl.com/)It's important to lay a solid understanding of programming and computer fundamentals before diving into parallel programming. Parallel programming APIs like OpenCL are a huge abstraction, and it assumes the user has a solid understanding of how they want to parallelize their workload and exactly how they're going to manipulate the GPU.If you have any questions, I'd be happy to chat for a bit!EDIT: Here's a good book for learning about computer architecture. If you're interested, it would be a good project to implement the ISA they talk about in C after you've gotten comfortable with the language: \"Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition\" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy",

Then you can try shipping the website and getting users to make it more impressive. Might be a good idea to implement buzzwords like AI, popular tech stacks, etc into it too.For data science, something like building your own ML model based on a domain-related data set comes to my mind. You can show skills like data wrangling and cleaning as well as feature engineering and model training.Just make sure you document it well. In your portfolio give a really good description of WHY you did the project and what is the value of it. If you do ship your project be sure to include stats and numbers that show impact. Companies value people who can identify and solve problems more than simply good coders.Also ngl asking what good projects look like might be a good talking point in a coffee chat.",

It could work \"behind the scenes\" (meaning that your front-facing public methods `FindById`, etc. *call* the generic `GetEntry` with the appropriate arguments) so that you don't have to rewrite the entire methods. This way, you have one method that does the work and separate methods for code clarity facing the front/user side.The dedicated methods (no matter which way, as independent methods, or calling the generic) have the advantage that they assure only valid fields can be queried.There is only one caveat `String field` is a bad idea.

It also signals clearly what each method is doing, which is autodocumenting. in the second case you have to look a little closer. And while it can be convenient to use \"field\" as a variable that means people could call it like: GetEntry(someVariable, someValue);leaving you with no idea what is going on. (or whether someVariable actually exists). now imagine this call is being done in code outside of your reach. (a client library for instance). you wouldn't know what variables they are using. so if you ever change the database you won't have an automatic warning that the field they are selecting on exists. Except at runtime which is not ideal. If you make the same changes in the first example, (remove a findBy..... because the field is no longer offered), the client will get a compilation error when a developer updates to the latest version of your library. which they will be much happier about than an error in the rare situation a user sorts a table by pressing a UI element the developers never touch.I know what I write is slightly charged / exaggerated but I tried to sketch the use cases where you would know the difference.I think you are falling into a beginner trap where more code looks inefficient. And creating a godly one-liner that handles everything / runs the whole program looks good. But more verbose self-documenting code generally is code that will have less bugs later on. because you won't be the only programmer working on your code. You may not even be at the employer when someone tries to work on a function / replaces something. for instance in your case: it is easy to replace findById with findByIdOrSecondaryId because it'll be clear where you use it and you'll get a compiler error if you forget one since the original doesn't exist. But it is entirely possible you overlook GetObject( \"id\") (possibly because of whitespace differences and such.Think about cleanness of code in the sense that it should be straightforward to read. Don't shy away from extra functions. However what you can do is have findByName and findByEmail and findById all internally call GetEntry(string field, string value) if you wish. (to share error handling/recovery/etc). that way you present stable methods to the outside world and you can have more generic reusable functions for internal use.none of this is absolute truth of course, just advice",

For another customer (a university), we built a search form where students could search for and apply to different courses. The students were seldom users, had no knowledge of different parameters, so had just one free-form text input that we matched against a special database view where we merged all relevant data from different tables and columns into one against which we matched the query (the more words that matched in a resulting row, the higher the score the result got).A search index could be an alternative; again, much depends on the type of application you build and your requirements.",

Maybe you added the valid fields to the documentation for the function, and maybe that comes up as part of intellisense, but then I have to read through the description and I could still mistype one of the field names.With individual methods I hit . on your model and intellisense gives me a list of all the ways I can use it.

That's the way to learn.Think back: how long did it take you to grasp math? How long for more difficult math subjects? How many times have you failed? How many subjects did you not immediately uinderstand?Did you even consider giving up?Stop using AI - completely. Pretend it doesn't even exist.If you get stuck, go back a chapter and start over. Take it slow.Work through the prompts on paper, with pencil. More than often, it is not the actual *programming* that is the problem; it's *understanding* the task as you cannot solve anything that you do not fully understand.Again, take it slow. Play with the code. Change it. Break it. Fix it - **without AI** - do not take the easy way out (using AI) - take the hard way. **learn**.It's not Kaggle that is the problem. It is your approach to learning and your mentality. You thought it would be easy. You thought, you could breeze through. It isn't easy. It takes a lot of effort, determination, discipline, persistence, and hard work.Most likely, you progressed too fast with your use of AI. Slow down. Take time to *truly understand* what you are programming.Yet, again: pretend AI doesn't exist and that you're on your own.----Side note: my go-to recommendation for absolute beginners is the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.

Replace X and Y with a language, and something like: todo app, chat app, calculator, snake game, calendar. Those tutorials don't focus as much on things like \"programming fundamentals\" and \"language features\", and will give you a lot of good example code to help you build stuff.You should ***really*** try to get back to revisiting \"programming fundamentals\" and \"language features\", but those are also things that are fine to skip over for a while if you just wanna get started and \"make stuff\". I never really liked those multi-hour long \"intro to programming\" videos and much preferred learning that kind of stuff through written material (but only after I made a couple projects and got sucked into programming).",

        "body": "One surprising lesson you might discover: learning about something doesn't mean you can create something.Let's say you want to learn to hit a forehand in tennis. You listen to a bunch of tennis teachers on YouTube explaining how to hit a forehand. Maybe you choose to imitate Roger Federer's forehand. You watch how he hits in slow motion. You shadow stroke it.Then, you go on the court, and you don't hit anything like him. What happened? There are subtleties about his game you can't see if you just watch video. Maybe you focus just on his hand, but ignore the rest of his body: his torso, his legs. Maybe you don't fully understand how he gets acceleration. You observe things, but they still don't fully capture what's really happening because you make assumptions.OK, maybe this didn't happen to you, but it did happen to me. It made me realize looking at someone do something doesn't teach *me* how to do it. I lack a lot of information despite paying attention.I think the same may happen to you. Yes, you'll learn some things looking at projects, and yes, programming isn't tennis. Programming is more quantifiable. But, like watching a pro tennis player, looking at a completed project may not be enough to understand it.Even when the person who programmed it explains it, they're likely to skip all the beginner stuff and assume the person listening is not a beginner. If I built a website using Python and Django and you didn't know how a loop works in Python, then I'd spend forever going over the basics of Python just so you could understand it.Instead, I'd assume you know Python, you had some idea of how Django works, and then I'd go into the specifics. You'd miss out on the details of the Python language or a big picture view of how Django works.But give it a try and see what you learn. Some of your problems with learning are likely linked to getting bored easily, but if diving in helps, then great. You can ask ChatGPT (or similar) to explain code to you, but they do have token limitations, which means you may not get much explained before you run out for the day.",

That's fine - we all start at the same place.>I made a calculator that you can use your terminal but that's pretty much it.How does it work? Can I type in 5 \\* 6 + (3 - 4) / 8, and it will give me the right answer, or is it more restricted than that? Can it handle fractions? Can it handle exponentiation? Factorials? Basic polynomial algebra? If I give it an unusual expression like 3 - (-(-2)), does it handle it as expected? If I give it a syntactically illegal expression like \"5 + \\* 5\", or a mathematically illegal expression like \"3 / 0\", does it handle it gracefully without crashing?There's a **lot** that goes into building a calculator, and this kind of thing might be an interesting project. If you're not interested in calculators, don't think of it as a calculator: think of it as \"teaching the computer to understand commands\". This is a whole field in its own right - tokenising, lexing, parsing, building syntax trees, Backus-Naur, and all that - and this is a (small but significant) step towards building something like a compiler. (As a side benefit, it will also make you better at understanding and reading certain kinds of documentation.)Also: when you do this, you'll probably want to reuse your old calculator code, but you might find that extending your code to accept these new features is more trouble than it's worth, and you have to rewrite it from scratch. Don't be afraid of doing this, even multiple times if you have to - in fact, I think it's a really good thing in the learning stage. Implementing individual features is one thing, but learning how to structure large projects in a clean and modular way - so that you can swap out features, upgrade them, rewrite them without changing all the rest of your code - is a skill in its own right.>I saw a guy build a snake game that was cool.Why not try building that yourself? Or Pac-Man, or Tetris. It can be in the terminal if you want - just redraw the board as a grid of characters every second - it'll look ugly, but that's fine.That said, if you're feeling up to something a bit more of a challenge, then why not learn to use a library like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)? That's a simple way of getting graphics onto the screen. Fair warning: once you start using external libraries, the difficulty **does** spike a little, because you're suddenly having to learn a whole new feature set that you know nothing about, with all of the syntactic difficulties that come along with it. In practice, what that means is you will spend a lot of time learning how to read documentation efficiently, which is also a crucial skill for a programmer.>I don't exactly know the full capabilities of c++ so I'm open to suggestions.Literally anything a computer can do, you can do it in C++. Most operating systems are written in C, which you can think of as a very bare-bones version of C++. Most modern programming languages have compilers / interpreters written in C/C++. Most browsers and web servers are written in C/C++. The main barrier here is not the capability of C++: it's the fact that even very \"simple\" software can be tens of thousands of lines of code, and you need to work towards that. So don't be afraid to rewrite things that people have already written before: they will be very valuable learning tools.",

The point of a singleton is to only ever have one instance of a class, so if snapshots would be multiple instances then it would break the design.If you wanted to have one “main” config class that utilized singleton then you could create a “config manager” to be a singleton that holds the main config instance. This slight change will let you utilize any benefit of a singleton while also being able to create multiple instances of the config class.At that point, the benefit of a singleton may not be as obvious and will be more of a personal choice than a necessity",

        "body": "The problem with your argumentation in favor of a singleton is that it is always context dependent. Yes, the way your program is currently implemented may need only one instance of a Configuration. But software changes over time and I've seen it plenty of times that something was introduced as a singleton when only one instance of the thing was required and later it turned out that (under certain conditions) you need multiples of that thing. Something as simple as a test that runs the code that depends on the singleton twice can become impossible to implement properly. And refactoring a singleton away can be a lot of work.Another general issues with singletons is that you can access them from anywhere (as there often is a global Singleton::GetInstance() function or similar). This means that (as opposed to using dependency injection) it is hard to tell what code depends on the existence of that singleton, making it hard to reason about the code. And then there are other issues like initialization/deinitialization and dependencies between multiple singletons, etc. That's the reason why the singleton pattern is considered an anti-pattern.That being said there are common cases where I see singletons used frequently (e.g. for a clock or a logger object) where it can be justified but even for those I've seen it cause problems that they are implemented as singletons.For your specific case, I would not implement a Configuration as a singleton. The example you provide (multiple instances of calculations using their own copy of a Configuration object) is reason enough to not make it a singleton.",

Really, just go find a tutorial for your language, choose some stuff you want to work on and go there. Working on a project will teach you a lot and the knowledge will likely stick better. Once there, books will help you with getting more specialized knowledge, not otherwise easily available in any other forms. Although THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.That's my humble opinion as it is. Maybe my ADHD brain wasn't capable enough of reading, but that's it.",

This is basically a slightly fancier version of a power point presentation that looks and feels like your envisioned end product but is totally scripted without underlying functionality. Like idk you might click on the map and it zooms in but that only works for one spot cause it's using screenshots of the map not an actual GIS integration.Lots of tools out there to do this, I wouldn't bother recommending one as I don't think I've used the same one twice. They are generally tailored to specific tech stacks anyway.Putting something like that together in a couple weeks is very doable. It can be used to showcase your idea much better than a janky \"working\" prototype. It's also not wasted effort in the long run as it serves as a clear design plan for actual Dev.",

So, a good solution would be a chrome extension that grabs the current tab's link that you want to send to someone and it automatically shortens it using the bitly API or however you want and you can save it or copy it or create a QR code with it, whatever. You can create this project with the technologies you have, it is very easy.Solving your own problems with code is one of the most rewarding and motivating things you can do.",

Windows may have an API to access the memory of another application but you would probably need administrator access, I don't know if this can be \"blocked\" by an application.Just be aware that the location in memory you need to access may change based on a whole bunch of things outside of your control. So you are probably going to have to:1. Find the location of what you are interested in.2. Find a pointer that points to that location.3. Find a pointer that points to the pointer that points to the location.Repeat step 3 until you find a memory location that reliable doesn't change. To make matters more difficult you may need a pointer that points before the location and an then increment it by an offset. The offset may be constant or it may be provided in another memory location.At least that is how I would tackle the problem.",

However, to get Windows to load an unsigned driver, you have to use the boot menu to disable driver signature enforcement.The driver will expose an API (accessed through IOCTL calls) that will allow a user mode program to pass it a process ID. You will then write a user mode program that will find or get the process ID of the target application and pass it up to the driver.The driver can then use functions like MmProbeAndLockPages, and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache to build MDLs for the virtual memory regions that you are interested in in the target application, lock them into physical RAM, then map them back down into the virtual address space of your user mode program.Once you have done that, the user mode program will have a \"live view\" into the memory of the target application, and can write whatever values it wants to disk.That is assuming you have solved the problem of figuring out which virtual address you are interested in in the target application.Note that this is all quite difficult, and not something for a novice programmer to take on. I used to do this kind of stuff for work, when I was working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on it. It was infinitely easier for me because I wrote the code for both applications and the driver, plus my driver was signed. I was just using this technique to share memory between applications in a closed environment.",

For example, you can't really build your own list in Python because it would itself have to be made out of lists, since there is no data structure provided which is more primitive than that. It would be nonsense to try. If you want to learn data structures, I would highly recommend learning C. C++ and Java are possible choices too but those languages are quite a bit more complicated, whereas plain C is quite \"bare bones\". It's not only easier to learn as a langauge, but its primitives are truly primitive. In C you actually build real data structures - linked lists, array lists, hash tables, etc... rather than create silly simulations of them.",

You must correctly escape *outputs* when you embed them in anything that's going to be parsed: an SQL statement, an HTML document, etc. (For that reason, I think that having HTML escaping in an \"input validation\" library is pretty nonsensical.)Escaping is essential for the parsing on the other end to work correctly, even leaving aside the dangers of XSS.When you're running JS code in the browser, and you set a property with `textContent`, you don't need to do any escaping because the string you're providing is not going to be parsed as HTML. It's just being directly passed into the DOM. On the other hand, if you assign to `innerHTML`, then the string you assign will be parsed as HTML. So if you have text that should be interpreted as text rather than HTML, it must be escaped.If you are using EJS to generate HTML code, then HTML escaping is likewise necessary. But EJS already handles this escaping for you. (But it's very important to read the documentation to ensure you understand when and where this happens!) You can use \"View Source\" in your browser to see the escaped output for yourself.> However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?The whole point of escaping *outputs* is that no matter what string the attacker puts into your database, if you escape it correctly, the recipient of your output will interpret it as that same string of text, rather than as HTML tags.Reddit does not prevent me from typing `alert(1);` in a comment, nor should it. Me causing that string to be saved in Reddit's database is not \"manipulation\", it's just normal usage. But that's why it's crucial that Reddit correctly escapes the string when generating pages.> Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?As long as you always use parameterized queries, and never build queries with string concatenation, then yes. (And as long as you don't do other silly things that would enable *indirect* SQL injection, like reading a value from the DB and then executing it as a query.)",

The ideal candidate knows several languages and can use the right tool for the job.For now I'd say don't stress about what language you pick because you shouldn't be learning only one.

Thats incredibly low. And thats not a modern trend. Is it impossible to break in to tech self taught? No. Is it the pathway with the highest failure rate and least chance of success? Yes. If you have the time, getting a degree is always worth it. Especially in Germany because a) your education system is excellent b) unless its changed, your degree will be free, right? AI isn't anywhere near good enough to replace anyone despite the CEO jargon. Its just a pretext to save money temporarily. But as software services and products continue to get worse (and they are) there will be more push back to higher quality professionals. Current AI can't really do as much as a good junior. And it won't progress as fast. The advances needed to truly replace human developers outright are based on future advances, and will be incredibly expensive. Plus there are too many restrictions to even know if this is achieveable (theres only so many computational power and electricity to go round). And even if that comes to pass, you will always need experienced humans to observe, work with, audit, secure, tweak AI. There will still be jobs for this.",

To answer your questions, it usually takes anywhere from 6 months to 2 years to become job-ready, depending on how much time you dedicate to learning, your approach, and whether you have prior experience in tech. Many people find jobs after completing bootcamps or earning certifications, especially if they focus on building a portfolio of real-world projects. University degrees aren’t strictly necessary, but they can help in certain situations, especially in more traditional companies. That said, there are plenty of companies out there that prioritize skills and experience over formal education.As for AI, while it’s true that some tasks in development might be automated in the future, there’s still a strong demand for developers. AI is a tool that helps make development faster and more efficient, but there will always be a need for people who understand the problem-solving and design side of software. The future of the profession looks promising, as more industries continue to rely on tech, and new fields like AI and machine learning will require developers to build and maintain these systems.If you’re still uncertain about software development, consider learning AI/ML or data science. These areas are growing fast and involve lots of coding. But honestly, software development remains a solid choice for the long term, and getting into it now would still be worth it.

        "body": "Well there's two things here:1. If you need a game to make programming fun, then you're not interested in programming as a career.2. Some aspects of game programming are much harder than the usual fields of programming.I would say it's only good if they're already interested in programming and it focuses on the hard parts of game programming.If the course focuses on how to make a game, then they'll learn how to make a game, not programming. Almost no game design courses teach any amount of programming.If it's writing their own game engine or something, then it teaches a lot more.Also you can't say \"learn to program\" and \"JavaScript\" with a straight face. It's sad to see the focus entirely on WebDev. What is the goal: do you want them to learn programming or WebDev? GameDev is not a good way to learn WebDev.If you look at the CS50 course, you can see the order they go in: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/)They actually begin by having people make a game. But they basically learn no programming from it because it's using Scratch. I actually think that week could have been replaced with something better. Notice how they go all the way through an intro course and through Data Structures before they even start WebDev.I spent many years making games on Atari XE and graphing calculators. I went to a community college after that and learned basic programming. But a single Data Structures course was more impactful on my ability to program than all those years of experience combined.Also when I tutored math, people always said the same thing. They hated math until they learned it properly, then they loved it. They were so happy doing it. Teachers focus too much on making things \"fun\" instead of making things understandable. The fun comes naturally when they're learning.",

        "body": "I have tried making some introductory programming curricula based on making games, as well as an advanced DSA course - not as \"game design courses\", but simply using games as the applications that the students had to build.I still think it is an excellent idea, and it works really well, especially because when writing a game, you naturally run the code over and over, and it is never exactly the same, so you constantly discover new issues, more things to learn. Whereas if you build a program to display a list of items from a database, the moment you got a list, you are done, and leave that part of the code. Also, when you make a game you feel like you've built something - and you are proud to show it to others, and let them play it. Whereas when you've made a form for entry into a database, well ... :)And I believe that you can learn any programming topic from writing games - there's almost no single algorithm, pattern or data structure that doesn't fit into some game or other.However, I've had some issues - mostly with students and especially other teachers not understanding what they actually learned, so I'll give you some of them as \"warnings\" - not warnings against doing it, but warnings about how it might be received.* Students have a really hard time transferring skills between writing different kinds of software - when they learned how to write games, they didn't understand how it could be used in database-applications, when they learned frontend coding, they didnt' understand how it could be used in backend, then they learned terminal-applications they didn't understand how it could be applied to web-applications, and so on. It is important to add other kinds of applications using the same patterns as they learned in the games - so they don't think that it is a \"games course\", but see how learning to code with games, is just learning to code.* Students are extremely scared of math - not just matrix-calculations, or trigonometry, but something as simple as ratios, converting a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 50 and 300 is almost impossible for them to grasp. And in games there's a lot of math. Don't be discouraged by it, just be prepared to spend A LOT of time explaining even the simplest calculations.* Some students actively dislike having to create or even obtain graphics and other assets. But on the other hand they don't like just being given assets and \"forced\" to use them - expect to spend quite a bit of time explaining how to prepare those as well :)* As games get a bit more complex, there is a lot of prep-work in building the level or setting up the code for input. I recommend re-using code throughout the course, and copying in earlier \"blocks\" from some games to re-use later, so the students don't feel like they spend all their time typing in \"platform code\".* A lot of programming students nowadays actually don't know that many \"simple\" games, so it might be necessary with a bit of games history as well, to teach them about top-down, platforms, scrollers, shooters, and so on. I was surprised at how few of my references my students actually recognized - even when it got to board games!But otherwise, I think that it is a really, really good idea - and don't listen to the \"haters\" talking about how games programming and JavaScript isn't \"real\" programming! Every kind of programming is programming, and if something can inspire students to build more on their own, it is even better!",

When you're doing a reverse-engineering project like this, you can't really verify that your code is *correct*, you can only verify that it matches the assumptions you've made. It's entirely possible for one or more of those assumptions to be wrong.It's hard to say anything more specific without a lot more details about what you're doing. But when you talk vaguely about \"warming up the session\", it could be that there's something lurking there that you're not understanding. Maybe what you don't understand is just some weird complexity or idiosyncrasy of the API. Or maybe it's a feature that's specifically designed to hinder the kind of reverse-engineering you're attempting.In particular, what comes to mind is that maybe something you're assuming is static is actually supposed to be dynamic. In that case, copying the contents of a previous request could be exactly the wrong thing to do. As an analogy, think of a remote-controlled garage door opener. Very primitive versions of this technology just transmitted a fixed code over the radio, which could easily be intercepted and replayed. Modern systems use a [rolling code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code) which means the signal changes every time based on a shared secret. To successfully spoof those systems, you need to either extract the secret from a legitimate transmitter, or find a cryptographic flaw in the system itself.Or maybe the process of \"session initialization\" is more complicated than you think it is. Maybe there are additional requests that are needed that you aren't capturing, or some subtle reason why the data you're sending is considered invalid when used more than once.As another example: the Reddit API is uses \"continuation tokens\" for pagination. If you request a list of posts, the first page will contain a token like `after: \"t3_1lh2t6p\"`, and then you make a second request with `?after=t3_1lh2t6p` to get the second page. But those tokens can expire after a relatively short period of time. So if you save a link to the second page, it will eventually stop working, even if everything about how you're sending the request is correct. At that point, you have to re-fetch the first page and get a new token. Similarly, you may think you've found and mimicked all the prerequisites to set up a valid session, but maybe you missed something.It could even be that there's some difference at a lower level of the protocol stack than you're observing, e.g. the authentic client is sending some extra metadata along with the TLS session that distinguishes it from your client, either intentionally or accidentally.",

The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades.

They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).There are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.It stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output?

Because the way this society is going, you're going to need a financial safety net larger than you're thinking right now. The societal safety nets are disappearing.If anything happens to you and your capacity to bring in money, you're going to wish you had enough money such that your *money* generates money -- i.e., investments so large that you can live off the interest alone. And you're not going to have the leftover funds to invest with an average salary if you're ever laid off, get sick, get into a car accident, etc.Most of those people whose jobs you're eying won't be able to financially recover from a bad diagnosis, let alone retire.Think back to when you were in college and money was tight. That's going to be your life without a good income. You just forgot what that's like.If you don't hear anything else I'm saying, just remember that you can always find ways to socialize and engage with your interests with a high salary. But a low salary is a limiting factor that puts hard a ceiling on every other aspect of your life. And I truly believe a person's earning power is the single hardest thing to change in life. So hard, in fact, that most people never do it.Only quit your current line of work at your current company if you just can't stand to do it anymore and it makes you absolutely miserable. I'm talking, you *dread* getting up in the morning and your evenings are spent agonizing about having to go back to work the next day. To the point where the dread consumes you and it becomes your whole life.Beyond that, consider yourself lucky to be able to do what you do, for the salary you do it at.**Edit:** If you really don't want to do that kind of work long term, the best thing you can do is look into FIRE-ing and retire early. You have the salary to do that and do it comfortably. But your friends with low salaries would have to live like literal paupers to do even half of that. I'm talking worse than you lived when money was tight in college.",

        "body": "I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that’s nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley → venture capitalists followed the talent → successful companies emerged → created more high-paying jobs → attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can’t replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.All of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",

This results in pretty insane demand for engineers in certain parts of America. whereas, in europe, there are far more engineers and far less jobs.

That's 900 hours, almost a half year of work, wasted to fill one opening.For all you know, it's an automated E-Mail they sent to every applicant. Then, once you submitted a solution, then they actually read your resume, determine you aren't qualified, and reject you without even reading your work.Pre-interview coding tests enable employers to waste vast quantities of candidate time. They're expecting a time commitment from every applicant, but they're investing zero.My personal rule is that I only do the take-home if I think it will take me an hour or less.",

Cue them emailing to me on Friday at 4pm, giving me exactly three days to complete it. Worked through the weekend, completed it in depth, nothing after that. It was absolutely not anything that could be used as \"free work\" either - it was simply a time-consuming bootcamp-level web project that took about 10 hours.All I can say is - ignore all the snobs in this thread criticizing you for agreeing to hop to a take-home assignment at all. They'll be singing a different tune if and when they find themselves months deep into a current-market jobhunt and getting maybe one or two responses per month to jump at the chance for.

Let's have Chad Jebity do it!The result was this very large codebase that essentially creates deployment stages for every workbook that gets added into the pipeline and it iterates through a list to populate the data. It literally takes 20-30 minutes for me to run the pipeline and validate a change that usually takes 1 click in the browser.I've been trying to explain to them that this won't scale and will eventually have to get replaced, but trying to get them to understand Big O notation was like drawing blood from a stone. I've realized life is much easier if I just go with the flow and use those 30 minute pipeline runs as a break to focus on sharpening my own axe.",

For me I think what i've really grown to enjoy is just continuing to use Neovim with CoPilot completions and a CLI based agent. I find the CLI based agents really solid for querying my code base about something I might want to do, and when the task is small enough that the CLI can spin up something that I can read in a few seconds to determine if it's correct. But I found that \\_miromanaging\\_ the agent in Cursor is really just not how I want to develop with AI on a daily basis. It doesn't bring me joy, and if it doesn't bring me joy, my work is going to suffer and bugs will slip through.

A little closer to home, think about Kubernetes and Docker - again, *absolutely world-shattering* for the industries it affects, a market of somewhere in the $200B range, that replaced entire teams of inefficient human labor... but it's just part of our tools today, and it had a net positive effect on jobs.I think it's not going to live up to its promise, my guess is we'll see a \"crash\" more like we saw with cloud tech 20-odd years ago. The 10% of useful tools will stick around, and the 90% of AI cash grabs / unsustainable businesses will die off.Also, most forms of gen AI are **currently** *wildly* unprofitable - the market is currently operating under the assumption that costs will fall dramatically, and/or benefits will continue to improve.

In general what I see is that Apple offers lower base pay but higher TC for \"equivalent\" levels.Unless you're an extremely strategic hire, Apple generally only negotiates based on your current salary or competing offers. If your offer doesn't match your current TC, Apple will ask for evidence (like a pay stub) and probably beat it. They will probably increase stock to match, not base salary.Apple's stock refreshes are generous. Even if you only meet expectations, you'll get a stock refresher every year and that will increase your annual total compensation.Don't forget that Apple hasn't had mass layoffs like most other tech companies. It's one of the more stable companies I've worked at. You'll work hard but you won't be in fear of losing your job.",

Had a college friend that got decent internships, and wasn’t entirely sure which direction or focus to go in. After he got his first full-time job at Nike right out of college (cause of the internships), he was able to explore and decide that he wanted to focus on cybersecurity. If you know you like one more than others, focus on that. I heard cybersecurity is not easy to get into, but idk if it really matters what your focus is when you don’t have any work experience. Try and get a freelance gig this summer, maybe even do your own project that you put on a portfolio to help you get an internship next year. Start applying for 2026 internships in October",

And then you should take the job/internship even if it’s for very little money. If you need to continue living at home with your parents or make money on the side then do that. But try to build up 6 months/1 year experience. Enough to hop on to a different job. I speak from personal experience. My first internship I made under 1000 a month for a company with like 5 people. I then switched to a bigger startup where I made about 25 an hour. After that I was able to land a Microsoft internship which was a big step. One of the things that helped me get that job is that I also did some side projects which made a good impression during the interview and buffed my resume. From there I went to work full time at Meta, and now I’m making over 400k a year. So ideally you build up over time, and try to constantly learn, get experience, and move up. Hopes this helps.",

Is it possible there are actually growth areas for you that they've identified and you're being defensive and combative? This is really common with junior engineers - they start making progress and gain a little independence, think they're much more self sufficient than they actually are because they have no perspective on things, and then can't accept feedback because it means reassessing their view of their work as maybe not quite as perfect as they'd imagined. If you can learn to accept feedback and address the good stuff and let the incorrect stuff slide off your back without a strong reaction you'll be much better off.",

Don’t be picky at all. The jobs no one wants (boring company, no remote work, maybe not exactly what you wanted, low pay) are the ones that others probably won’t be applying to as much. You just need to find something that is remotely close to writing software (even if it’s embedded and you want to do web, for example). If you get a job, work there and build your resume until the market improves. Then go find a job you actually want. Also, reach out to recruiters in your area. Friend every recruiter you meet on LinkedIn and ask about openings. They can help you set up more interviews. Make sure you emphasize that you’re a quick learner and are excited about a company, even though it might seem boring to you.The worst jobs to apply to are the ones posted on job sites that allow remote work. They will get thousands of applicants. Find the ones that no one is applying to, if possible. Also, go to meetups in your area that are relevant to your industry (the MeetUp app I think is still around for this.)Worst case, get a job at a software company as a QA person, support person, or a sales engineer. Then after working there awhile, express your interest in moving to a dev position. It’s way easier to move inside a company than to be hired from the outside.",

Thats a mental health nightmare waiting to happen and the 4 week maternity leave is a joke And will only be more exasberated as the only devops. That also means pressure to not call out sick and pressure to come back early from maternity leave. When you have multiple people, someone can help shoulder the responsibility. That alone without knowing the other specifics is a huge red flag for me personally. Offer2 is the deal to take based on the information posted.",

Its the leadership's fault at that company not yours for the situation you were burnt out in but you can often guide leadership out of holes they dig themselves into like that.

Also OP. MD is tiny, people that like to shoot and have it as a BIG part of their identity would have moved to VA. Yes it can be more expensive and time consuming....but you have to pay to play when you move to the tristate area/NOVAAgain...something you should have factored in.

Don't compare yourself to your seniors or to other juniors who have been there longer when it comes to speed.2) Onboarding for a new engineer takes from 3 to 6 months.

Communicate what's blocking you, don't surprise your team or your lead, and learn as fast as you can. Focus on understanding your team's process and best practices, and testing your changes rigorously. Seek to pair with every other person on your team at least once.",

The minute those cash flows slow down, these corrosive practices slow the company so much that C-Suite lays off 10s of thousands of people. We are witnessing this as we speak. The corrosive FAANG practices haven't yielded any returns when times are tough.Why? Because corrosive companies ask for a lot from employees without giving any stability in return. The beaten down workers learn to not give a rats ass about these companies. When times are tough, you can be assured that employee number 12345 is not going to go above and beyond to help them - because the company didn't help them during the good times.Getting out of the rat race is the right idea. One way to get out is to have enough investments that you can switch industries.without feeling the pinch of money. Another is to retire. Another is to start a business which is riskier. Another is options gambling which can return cash flow routinely with some risk. Another option is temporarily relocating to a cheap geo to stop the bleed of money The best examples I have seen are Airbnb owners and vloggers from 2018-2022. They truly understood the garbage of tech companies and invested in their exit when times were \"good\" and management was still shitting on them. One guy I know started a social app and exited the garbage of corporations.Not easy.",

There could be avenues for expansion, revenue increases, tangential markets, all those things. Not only that, but it's extremely valuable to see production software systems in action, and get a sense of what a successful 0 to 1 project actually looks like.Additionally, I'd try to independently build your software career to the point where you are a tech lead or otherwise have a couple years experience leading teams, since that's essentially what your role would be. You could make the mistakes you need to learn how to lead on your own time, or you could use the company. One of those will be far better for your career and the value of the business!",

After recognizing that, it's basic unwanted emotion management: Acknowledge the feeling and what it's telling you (this job is important to you), then let it go. I find once I'm in flow, I'm fine, so it's just getting over that initial hump that takes effort. You may have to try a few times to get past the feeling. It's ok if this is difficult at first. This is an important soft skill, and like all skills, it takes practice.In my experience, it's actually really rare to be fired for performance unless you do like, literally nothing for months. Usually it's some political game happening 3 levels above you that you have no control over, and performance is just the excuse they use to justify someone sacrificing their pawn to take a rook. I have seen so many amazing engineers get fired for \"performance\" who were certainly out performing me.The best way to protect yourself is to just be reliable, and get your work done. You can't hit your target if you're watching everyone else draw their bow.~ Sincerely, a FAANG worker that has survived 3 layoffs (and probably a fourth, soon :grimacing_face:)P.S.: there are two books that may help, though I've never read them.

As a platform, it encourages extremely negative interactions, and the anonymity means there's no consequences of either being brutally honest but also of lying. And of course, the biggest issue: there's no way of verifying almost anything people say. I'm not saying that people always lie, there's a lot of frank and honest discussion that happens. I'm saying that you can't tell when people are lying, because you don't know who they are, can't really verify anything, and there are zero downsides to lying.I would also not call it representative. Blind users don't represent a majority of employees at most companies, and the site self-selects for the kind of people who _want_ to engage in the kind of negativity you get on that side.

CEO figures to cut the recurring maintenance cost of the third party product and your boss has said they can build an in-house tool that will be just as effective. On point 1 you should be aware that regulators regularly share findings with each other. So if company A gets a 'noted deficiency' the other auditors look for that in other companies. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_It's also possible that your SVP is being defensive.

The Board should have a Board Member responsible for Compliance / Audit. If you can identify that person you could send an anonymous email cc'ing the Board Chair as well asking whether they were aware that email monitoring was being discontinued.

I went to WGU and it was super affordable and I learned a lot. No matter what if you do pursue CS you need to do side projects and additional outside learning. Side projects are very important and it shows that you enjoy / are interested in CS. Speaking of, make sure before you go to school for CS I highly recommend doing some self learning and make something small. I know a lot of people who go to school for CS, spend the money and realize they don't like it mid-degree and switch OR even worse get their whole degree and not like to code. Make sure when selecting your major you aren't just picking something that \"makes a lot of money\" but also consider what you think is interesting. Then consider how you get there, and in many many cases you don't need a degree depending on what you decide. The last advice I'll give is that college is always there. I get the impression you're younger, and from experience I think going to college right after high-school is one of the worst things about society. In the past going to college and \"figuring things out\" wasn't a big deal because it was priced very very differently. Now due to the cost of most colleges I'd rather recommend a new high school grad to spend time working and looking into career fields they find interesting. Then reach out and find people doing those things and see if you can find someone who will help answer any questions about what its actually like doing those things and the day-to-day.",

AI is a set of tools that can be used to expedite work and outsourcing is always going to be around in either consultants for specialty work or delegation to remove simple processes to keep costs down. Re- outsourcing Outsourcing or delegation of labor has been around for my entire career. Firms tend to dabble in an effort to think they cs save money and that staff are fungible. What’s not fungible is learning and understanding of vestigial projects. Where outsourcing works is when the team is seen as another dev group and can solve projects entirely on their own without constant supervision from home office because staff have relocated there and the firm is invested for the indefinite future. Otherwise it’s executives dabbling with consulting groups that fail because they need to call in more staff to do what is being asked or write better requirements. Re - AI Just another set of tools that really depend on where they are sourcing more than anything else. Think of moving from paper to a computer in the 70s to do bookkeeping. The general ledger was a legit book where inflows and outflows were recorded. I worked on wall street where funds would calculate their values and holdings at the end of day by hand. Think of a circular saw , if you don’t know how to cut 4x8 sheet of plywood well your just going to do it faster than a handsaw. Same deal with a car - it’s great you can drive it but if you don’t have a general clue of where you’re going you are going to go somewhere quickly. It helps you expedite but you need the expertise to understand holistically what you want to accomplish.",

Interviewing is a task where working engineers are incentivized to minimize their time on it. This means that they want interviews that take them zero time to prep and “objective” evaluation criteria. Twenty years ago Google made headlines by asking brain teasers in interviews like “how many ping pong balls would fit in a jumbo jet?” This led to the rise of cargo-cult interview processes where you just grab two leetcode medium questions to ask in a 60 minute interview. If we run seven rounds like that then we can claim that we only hire the smartest 0.1% of all engineers. (Approximately none of that is true, btw.)In other words, it’s popular because interviewers are lazy and there’s a huge population seeking jobs.Here’s my advice: give yourself a time limit to practice this stuff, but take s many real interviews as you can—even just for practice (and even if you fail). If you find a role that *doesn’t* do these kind of lazy interviews *go there* — the culture you see in the interview process is the culture you will see at the company.",

        "body": "Quick caveat that if you're in India, I have no idea if this applies to you.In my experience, which admittedly is only about 6 years so maybe a grey beard can correct me, is that the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that a technical interview is like a test at school. Most of the time they are not, and if you come across a company that does treat interviews that way, you don't want to work there anyway.A technical interview that's administered well and evaluated fairly is an evaluation of your problem solving process and your understanding of the technology you're working with. Here are my tips, many of which I've gotten from FAANG recruiters so I assume they're good for most of the industry:- Do not start coding right away. Collecting requirements is a good thing, and something that good interviewers will appreciate.- Always think out loud. You're better off talking through a problem than keeping your entire process internal. It allows the interviewer to hear how you arrive at a solution, what you're taking into consideration, and even allows them to interject if they have a suggestion or you've misunderstood the problem.- As you're outlining and then coding your solution, talk through what you're doing and mention trade offs. Stuff like \"I'm going to use DFS here instead of BFS because....\" will demonstrate to the interviewer that you're not just reciting a memorized solution and you understand the options before you.- Do not get nervous if you get stuck. I'm naturally a bit nervous, and my first reaction is to get very sweaty if I'm not sure what to do next and it's cost me positions before. When you get stuck, just stay calm and talk it through with the interviewer. Most of the time they're happy to provide a hint or two, and as long as you don't come across as entirely clueless, it won't count against you. I would even go so far as to say it might help you a little, since someone who gets stuck isn't using an AI cheat tool. At least they know they're not being lied to. In summary, the technical interview isn't a test of whether or not you can invert a binary tree from memory. It's an opportunity to see how you solve problems, and the more junior the position, the more important coachability becomes, so taking hints and implementing them is not only ok, it's a good thing. Best of luck in your interviews. Just relax and work your way through the problem and you'll be fine.",

That said, a good interviewer should be nudging with \"You can probably start coding now\" or similar, when you've caught all the cases they expect you to.Also; I give a strong hint that I'm really only interested in the core algorithm, not the data classes, or really even method signatures. Some candidates try to do these anyway, but if you can focus on the problem and not the boilerplate, that may help.",

        "body": "Asking clarifying questions and understanding the problem is good... but you shouldn't just sit there and burn 10-15 minutes on it before writing a single line of code.Right now you're approaching interviews in a waterfall style. You're collecting all the requirements upfront, which takes a large amount of time, and you only start once everything's extremely well defined.Instead, maybe start approaching interviews with an agile approach. Sure ask your questions, but at the same time aim to get *something* on paper as quickly as possible. Get something going, and then ask clarifying questions as new things pop up while you're implementing. You don't need to spend 15 minutes asking questions before you're able to at least *start* coding, right? The questions aren't *that* vague. You don't need to be \"fast\", I think they're expecting you to be \"agile\" and take an incremental approach. Just like they don't expect you to arrive at the optimal solution the first time, they expect you to arrive at the brute force solution which you then iterate on to improve.I'm just hypothesizing here, maybe I'm way off base. I'm not the greatest interviewer, but my interviews are very much agile. I'm extremely communicative throughout, but I jump into running through examples ASAP, and get what code I can written ASAP. I can work out ambiguities and questions as I go.All that said, in the current job market, you don't need to be \"perfect\". I job hopped in 2024, which was also a very bad market, and for my current job I completely flopped one of the interviews. I did great at the backend oriented question, handled all the system design questions with ease, and then they hit me with some frontend stuff which is not my forte. I struggled, I needed hand holding, I didn't even get through the entire problem. And yet, I still got the offer.",

Be curious, ask questions about the codebase, understand the product you're building. Most people forget new devs need context on why they're building something, not just what.The \"work your ass off\" mentality is good but be smart about it. Focus on delivering quality over quantity. I'd rather have someone ship one solid feature than rush through three buggy ones. Oof, and the biggest pitfall? Not asking for help when you're stuck. Senior devs expect you to get stuck, they just want to see you've tried to figure it out first. Give yourself 30-45 mins on a problem, then ask.Also, document everything you learn about their systems. You'll thank yourself later and it shows you're thinking beyond just your immediate tasks.Research background is actually an advantage in startups. You know how to dig deep into problems and you're used to figuring things out independently. That's valuable.One last thing. build relationships with your teammates. Grab coffee, understand what they're working on. Technical skills get you hired but relationships help you grow.You got this :)",

I have an informal \"30 minute\" rule for our interns. If you're stuck on something, spend 30 minutes trying to figure it out on your own. If you solve one problem that leads to a new one, reset the clock. If you've made zero progress for 30 minutes then you can ask for help. This has two benefits:1. it forces you to be self-reliant and sharpen your \"figure it out\" skills which are incredibly important in this industry2. it prevents you from wasting an entire day on a problem someone knows the answer to in 30 secondsStart there.",

Because those roles are rigorous and always in high demand unlike most of the “full stack” javascript slop. Once you familiarize yourself with the shiny new tech stacks and do some leetcode grind, you might have an easier time doing personalized outreach to well funded startups in your area of expertise (cold dms to the founders/ctos, tapping into your network for intros etc) vs applying for roles via recruiters at a mid-large corporations that are currently on a hiring freeze or find your gap a bit too much of a red flag. I’ve worked at 3 different startups and “guy pivoting careers from physics to programming” or “guy coming back to work after a 2 year parental leave” weren’t uncommon archetypes, they only care about you moving quickly and getting shit done. Once you do a year or so at a startup doing some generalist work, you can go back to whatever role or company that appeals best to you without worrying about the gap. I do have some doubts on whether grad school is the move though, you’ll be burning way too much money in tuition + it’ll keep you occupied and away from full time work (on top of your 2-3 year gap) = all for very little marginal gains.Also, take most of the advice from this subreddit with a grain of salt, it mostly self-selects for unemployed new grads who complain about how the job market is impossible (yes it is definitely harder but not remotely “give up and find a different career” hard, if you’ve some experience under the belt)",

If you only worked there for 6 months, then the MS in CS might give you a chance to evaluate #2^^, and leverage 1)Your prior experience and 2) the fact that you’ll be in a MS program, to land internships. I feel like you’ll have a better shot at landing internships if you’ve got that prior work experience. Or if you do have like 2 YOE, then I would think you might be alright. Just really comes down to what you can do for a company and what skill sets you’re really bringing to the table, and real world experience helps you make your case for what you can/can’t do.

I would go 2-3 per position, and really focus on the main accomplishments. Also, don't exceed two lines per point.Second, try to be a bit more specific. For example, describe what the ETL pipeline did and what your contributions to it were. Focus on the impact you made and how you made it, rather than just listing technologies or describing the task.Third, I would also chill out a bit on the keyword stuffing. While you do have to massage a couple keywords into your bullet points, it should feel natural and not excessive. The skills sections is usually the better place for keyword stuffing technologies, whereas the bullet points are better for keyword stuffing higher-level concepts. Excessive keyword stuffing might get you through ATS more often, but it also will turn off humans. Try to strike a balance.Lastly, I skilled a summary altogether. I hear mixed things about them online, but I've found that dropping it improves the focus of my resume.My current resume is <400 words. In my opinion, with such high application volume, it's critical for a resume to be short and to the point. Taking away unnecessary wordiness and corporate speak makes your resume more concise and more authentic.",

Highlight relevant metrics early — if you improved uptime, reduced latency, fixed X bugs, share that up front in your summary/experience to catch attention.2. Focus on SRE/Full‑Stack wins — if you automated builds, improved CI/CD, or built backend services, list those first with details like languages, tools, outcomes.3. Tailor per location or industry — Austin vs. Raleigh vs. non-tech differs. Add a one-liner like “open to on-site roles in Austin or Raleigh” — helps with local filters.4. Consider adding a short “SRE/DevOps projects” section — even if small or self-led, that shows recent hands-on work and keeps ATS engaged.5. Update your summary to show recent progress: *“2 yrs backend/SRE experience; laid off recently but now focusing full-time on improving resilience through independent automation projects.”*You’re close — your core experience is solid. Want help tightening your summary or building a quick skim‑ready project entry? Feel free to DM — happy to help polish it for those market spots.",

Since you are so research focused I think you should continue applying to grad school programs. Plenty of people have been rejected by 9 to finally get accepted into 1 and it change their life. Same with jobs, when applying to need to accept only getting interviews for 1/50 applications.I think overall you need to decide what YOU want to do and make it happen rather than waiting for it to show up on a silver platter. For example if your dream is to get a PhD, then apply to as many schools as you can. I’m sure there’s a program excited to have you. If your dream is to work in industry, then apply to as many jobs that you’re interested in, and when you’re in the interview progress, sell yourself! I know it can be hard to not look at all the ways you don’t fully qualify for a job, but unless you think the job would actually be too difficult for you, most people have to learn on the job and rise to the occasion. Like many people lie saying they can do a skill, knowing they’ve never done it, or maybe have never done it professionally, but they know they are competent enough to figure it out in a week or month before starting the job and that they’ll be fine.",

Quite frankly after the clusterfuck of my PhD applications, I'm quite skeptical of what he said as all the potential supervisors said the same when I was applying for PhDs.Tbh 6 months later I've realized I couldn't mentally get myself to spend another 5 years as a broke (PhD) student and im a bit glad i got rejected.But you are correct, in that I need a thicker skin.

Have you escalated to your manager about the lack of access needed to do your job? Have you escalated about the unacceptable behavior that your lead did when they got back along with the failure of you potentially not have full access to dashboards and other information you should have access too?this is not a hard-skill issue it is a workplace management issue that needs to be addressed by your management.In terms of skills there are too many to list, I will also note many of the things that are classic DevOps are being automated or will be mostly automated so you will need to upgrade your skillsets to take advantage of the technology evolution that is occurring so you will be most marketable.The enhancement of your hands-on skills are great, but mainly only useful if you are still physically hands on with servers, switches, etc. if you like doing that do not let your hands on skills degrade due to non-use. For your virtual/physical setups be sure you still have a good foundation on Linux, Windows, and MacOS to be most marketable globally.Learn of all the different cloud providers capabilities pros/cons for AWS, Azure, GCP and start building in the cloud to include dashboards, building metrics, building automated workflows, etc. and see if you can upgrade your skills to the point to where you can move on to a new job. Make sure you are also continuing to train using official and non-official high quality sources to keep your hard skills sharp. If you are not networking outside of people you know at work you are doing a disservice, get out there and expand your network. That way you can reach out to people you actually know to land opportunities.",

Knowledge tends to be closely guarded rather than shared, and that limits opportunities for others to grow. I’ve tried to stay respectful and focus on what I can control. When I escalated, I was promised more structured handovers and collaboration, but so far that hasn’t materialized. I continue to show up, do my part, and document everything when needed. The meeting is scheduled on my calendar and nobody shows up. My predecessor told me that this guy is the nephew of ceo and hard to work with. OTOH my project manager and Dev Lead are helpful. I’m grateful for that. I’ve been learning independently and had only a 10-day KT session with my predecessor. Since then, I’ve been handling responsibilities without ongoing guidance. While it’s not ideal, I’ve accepted the reality and adjusted my expectations. I’m committed to growth, and that’s where I’m placing my energy.Right now, my first priority is delivering on my current job responsibilities. After that, I’m preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. I’ve also started work on a side project that combines AWS with SageMaker, with a focus on practical applications of agentic AI. Progress has been slower than I’d like, partly because I’m doing it solo and don’t have a mentor to bounce ideas off. Still, it’s helping me apply what I’m learning in a more real-world context.As for networking, I’ve been reaching out on LinkedIn and other platforms, but I’ve found that 9 out of 10 people simply don’t respond. I’ve also been trying to attend virtual and local seminars via Meetup.com. Unfortunately, events are quite limited in my country, but I don’t see that as a blocker. I’m not giving up. I know someone out there is looking for someone with drive and a willingness to learn. I just need to be in the right place at the right time.Your advice on staying sharp with hands-on skills, understanding cloud deeply, and constantly training through official and high-quality sources is spot-on. I’m applying it as best as I can and will continue pushing forward.Thanks again for your guidance. If you have any suggestions on communities that are actually responsive or mentorship opportunities worth exploring, I’d be grateful to hear them.",

Most of my CE & EE friends could only find web related roles.It's not as glamorous as other areas in tech, but IMO it feels more secure. The shortest I've been unemployed was 1 week. The longest was 3 months. Average has been 6 weeks. Oh, and I get to charge a premium for my age because the pool of talent skews older. Currently I'm the youngest on the team by 20 years. Chances of working in big tech are a bit lower (I have), but so is the stress much lower IMO.To put this in better perspective, while there might be 1000 web dev jobs in an area and have 1000000 people applying for them, there's probably only a measly 50 hardware jobs, but only 200 people applying to them.EDIT: want to throw some extra flavor into the mix? COBOL. I'm sure if you had some minor COBOL project (e.g. a calculator) that could really turn some heads.",

It doesn't mean that if you force yourself to present, one day all your anxiety and stage fright magically goes away and suddenly you're a pro presenter.It means that the more you do it, the easier that anxiety becomes to manage, and the less it impacts your ability to present. The anxiety's still there. It'll probably *always* be there. You're not going to \"get over\" it. But you will absolutely become better at managing it.I also hate presenting. I've always been uncomfortable with it. In college, and early in my career, the anxiety would really get to me. The anxiety would hit me so hard I can feel my voice straight up changing, dry mouth, stuttering, stumbling over my words, rushing, I start sweating, if it's bad enough I'll be shaking like a leaf.With years and years of on-the-job practice in the *professional* world, that anxiety slowly became more and more manageable. I think maybe 4 or 5 years into my career is when it became so manageable I started considering myself a *good* presenter.For example, not long after I started at my current job, I got the chance to present a demo of a new feature to all of our stakeholders. It was a very not-casual call with 50+ people on it. I crushed it, I spoke slowly and clearly, I communicated my points well, it went great. I got multiple comments, and even a formal email to my manager, mentioning how great of a demo was, specifically calling out how well I presented it.The anxiety was absolutely still there. Tons of it. Leading up to, during, and afterwards. But, at this point in my career, I can manage it to a point where it doesn't impact my ability to do an amazing presentation, it's not showing through my voice, or stuttering, or shaking anymore. I'm able to keep it mostly internal. Everything that goes into presentations today are very much leaned behaviors that come from practice.Presenting is going to be a very important part of your career. It gets even more important as you gain seniority, you're not going to be able to pawn that responsibility off for your whole career. Do the presentation. Keep doing them. It will get better. I'm living proof.",

Mid-demo the box froze. Without missing a beat, the demo guy, a 5.5 ft tall Indian version of Tom Cruise with similar steel nerves, pulls out the USB drive, inserts to the box debug port as the unit is rebooting, reprograms the unit in front of the CEO all while explaining that the unit is field upgradeable via USB. Unit reboots as expected and demo is great. The guy is now VP engineering for a major tech firm. You don't need to be able to do that but an internal demo should be easy enough to start.",

        "body": "In my opinion you should never relocate unless you already have a job lined up.Moving is expensive, risky, and there's no guarantee you'll even find a job in that specific area. Limiting your job search to a single area, especially in a bad market, makes the search significantly more difficult and time consuming.What's your plan if you can't line anything up for several months, or even a year? What if the only jobs you can find are ones that would require you to relocate a 2nd time to somewhere like Austin, or Detroit?If I were you, and I wanted to relocate to the Bay Area, I'd line up a job there *first*, and then move once I have one lined up. That's exactly what I did in my current city actually. My new grad job was in the Midwest, which was fine, but I always wanted to move back to the east coast. So once I had a few years experience under my belt, I started job searching in the city I wanted to move in, and then when I had something lined up, I relocated. I can't imagine quitting my job and moving to a very expensive city unemployed. In fact I probably wouldn't have even been approved for my apartment if I didn't have a job, they asked for my offer letter as proof of income.That said, what's your goal behind relocating? Do you *want* to live in the Bay Area? Or are you just looking for a hybrid/on-site job? If the latter, you can find those all over the US, there's a lot more places than just the Bay Area. You should be searching country-wide if that's the case, your job search will be way easier if you can lift the geographic restriction.",

Regrettably, the way I framed these tested rote memorization of keywords rather than understanding of core concepts- Questions that verify you understand environment variables and why they’re used for passing secrets to a program- basic Linux questions based around things I’ve had to do on the jobThe other interviewer asked questions about:- knowledge of the types available in Python,- knowledge about the type returned (tuple) when you put something like “return a,b”- the difference between a list and a tupleFor the coding portion we just asked them to return the string that appears the most within a list.——That all being said, my company is pretty laid back and doesn’t pay nearly enough for us to be asking leetcode type stuff. Other companies may take differing approaches toward interviews for their entry levels.——For those interested in how I’m planning on asking SQL questions in the future, I plan on writing some example SQL code ahead of time and just asking them to explain what it’s doing.That way I’m testing the ability to understand SQL rather than rote memorization.——",

Funny enough, I could not remember the keyword name at that moment but knew there was functionality for it. The OFFSET keyword. (While also using LIMIT)I chose these keywords because for the most part we rely heavily on the Django ORM at my company, and so when I’m writing queries it’s mostly to find data to try and replicate issues. These keywords were the ones I found myself using most frequently.Moving forward I plan on showing them queries with these keywords in them and asking them to explain to me what it’s doing, since the ability to understand an SQL query is a lot more valuable than rote memorization of keywords.",

If you think you will struggle to become motivated to succeed in school after the gap, then maybe it isn't a good idea.> I got pretty deep into math and cs competitions, and I feel like I would forgot most of what I’ve learned after the gap yearI was once told by a professor of mine that learning something is not about retaining that knowledge, but how quickly you can *re-learn* it. Everybody forgets over time, but if you know something, it will come back to you quickly after being exposed to it again. That rings true, in my experience. If you feel confident now, you'll be fine later. You'll be taking university classes, not doing calculations for the moon landing. There is plenty of time to ramp back up in first-year courses.> I’m kind of afraid that this would ruin my careerIt absolutely, and I cannot stress this enough, *will not*. I know more kids who burned out after college from the endless grind throughout their whole student life than I do those who \"ruined their career\" before it even began. I actually don't know any of the latter, but a lot of the former.> Some people also told me that I can take a gap year anytime, so I should spend my most meaningful years at school with friends.I can get behind the friends part, but both a gap year and going to school with your friends are very valuable things to spend your \"meaningful years\" on, though I disagree that meaningful years as as limited as that sentiment implies. Also, you'll make a ton of new friends at university, and being a year older won't change much there. 5-10 years, maybe, but you're still a peer to everybody after only 1 year away. That opportunity won't change.Taking your gap year *after* university is way more likely to effect your career, however. You'll hopefully make some connections at school, and having those connections be fresh as you look for jobs is a big deal. Applying to jobs or grad school while you're in your last year is much easier, especially if you're interning somewhere that may want to hire you.This is absolutely the *best* time to take a gap year, but if you do take it you should know what you want from it, even if that is just time away from the stress of the student grind.",

I’ve long said that I think tech lead is the absolute worst job you can have and I think that that often falls right in line with this.The problem is that you’re still expected to contribute code like any other engineer, but you start taking on more project management responsibilities that require heavy context switching. You end up doing 70% of two jobs that require very different skill sets and I think the only way most people manage is to put in extra hours.Once you’re beyond that level, I think your WLB actually starts to get easier because you’re no longer expected to write as much code. The problems you focus on are harder, but you have the ability to make more time to think on and you’re able to step away from the day to day work more.So yeah, I guess my point is that I think to get to any level above senior, you likely have to push through a few years of shit WLB, but beyond the senior level it actually starts to get better and not worse.",

But incidents do happen, and things get escalated, and if you're something of a principal engineer, you're likely to have some expectations of stepping into escalations at some capacity. How often that happen to you is really going to be dependent on where you work, how often shit breaks, and how high up people may need to escalate to get help fixing it on the quick.",

This is for multiple (usually two) teams concurrently. I am there to spot opportunities for collaboration and leverage, find different solutions to problems, to nudge people to think about different approaches. Sometimes I fill in most of the duties of a tech lead if someone is out.Part of the reason I do a bit of everything is that I have been promoted three times in seat. I am sure it would feel different joining a team as above-senior rather than previously having been in the lower roles on the same team. It's not like I'm going to refuse to do the things I did before, if there is an urgent need. It's just that normally there are other people to delegate to.Because I don't really hold any primary accountability for anything and have had managers largely leave me to do as I see fit, it doesn't come with much stress. I might be getting a new manager in a month or two, though.",

That makes me less visible during big events so it slows down my progress but I’ve done enough of the “hero” thing in the past that I don’t care to do it again regularly but can of needed. I’ve also switched into management which required a lot more after hours work than when I was in hero mode, and it was less fun, so I switched back.So no it doesn’t require more time investment while being above senior level but you need to pace yourself to find the correct balance to get there.",

Be kinder to yourself. Also at your experience level you will start to notice a lot of ageism where companies prefer fresh graduates than you, and those fresh graduates prefer working with other fresh graduates than you, even though it makes no sense on any level given your skills and experience. Often it is actually down to the age of the person managing you and whether they feel intimidated by you or not.Offshoring is the main threat though, plus the amount of competition with all the overqualified laid off people looking for work.FYI: I am in the process of transitioning to Cyber Security - hoping to land security reseacher/appsec/security engineer roles after 20 years in SDE/SDET/Devops roles.",

Not always, as I'm sure some PyTorch guys at Meta are making bank, but it's been a theme in my career.When I switched from a Haskell team, to a new team using Typescript, I was so far ahead of everyone else it just made sense for me to lead, and after that experience I continued to find myself in team lead positions for the subsequent two companies. WSo, I really like Haskell, I really like compilers, I really like Databases, but I've decided to go for impact in my career and use the tech as merely a tool, and that's taken me to some interesting (and well rewarded) positions. I might be able to get a job doing any of those things, but those jobs don't put me on pace to retire early.Anyway, you'll be fine if you switch, as you've done very difficult programming in a team environment, and that experience will never leave you.

You need to be working at the lowest level close to hardware and it constitutes a small portion of overall work distribution.On top of that reality is barely any of the manger level folks will understand what you are doing, so you work will never be valued correctly.Add to that, not to bring politics, but it one of those uncool jobs that most managers don't want to deal with. There's little growth in it in terms of products, no direct impact on revenue, a super long time from work being done to it's impact being seen. Most of the work gets anonymised. Whenever you get stuck with a bug , you need crap ton of people working to fix and there's a big downtime when they are not needed. So these roles are moving to places like China, India, Poland, Ireland etc.Also, the stuff you are doing is not strictly at complier level and there's a lot of neural net design itself. The roles you are targeting, ...any company would simply prefer someone from PhD to fill that role.Your best bet is to use personal connections, expand the scope of your work to computer architecture and look for roles where intrinsics needs to developed.It's not going to be easy to get a job simply because of nature of it but if you do find a good spot there's a huge payout.what companies are you applying for?",

The issue is, that women/whatever you’re into really don’t look for that, it’s actually more of a turn on to just be financially stable and emotionally available. So your choice is :1) Cokehead banging hookers who don’t care about you, and having everyone you love look at you as a cokehead. Work at a FAANG and develop an anxiety disorder, and then die early and stressed.2) Live within your means, be stable, be a good and relaxing person to be around, bang a hot chick who loves you, have people in general love you.

Being friends with those people will help a ton.Finally, you do have an internship. That research internship is something you can present as evidence that you are employable.Finally, I would wonder why you haven't taken any courses on things like OS, compilers, databases, etc. You know, core CS stuff. That might be something an employer might wonder too, why all your coursework is solely focused on Ai and ML. As for the job search, I'm left wondering how exactly you went about that. Like, did you spend a lot of your time on LinkedIn? Handshake? In person recruiting events? Direct company applications? Indeed?

If you were getting interviews, that's one thing(almost always just need to work on skills), but if you weren't getting any then it's clear your resume is getting filtered out. I would assume that after 400 applications, it's part your application having a few things that the ATS doesn't like, and part needing to try other methods. I mean, I plugged your resume into 3 ATS checker, and got 40-50% match on each. That's pretty poor. I'm guessing part of that is omission of information like phone number and email for the reddit post, but I would try to get it to around 80%. But that's just for ATS, and honestly any in person application is not great. What you need to focus on is getting some more in person stuff done. That's where you'll find far more success. UCSD should have a few career fairs, so attend all of them.",

        "body": "I've seen a lot of debate around ATS in this sub. After reading through tons of posts, I get that it might not be the only thing that matters, but I still don't want to risk it. So I decided to make an ATS-friendly resume just to be safe. I used both Claude and ChatGPT to create it, and according to those tools, I got a near-perfect ATS score.But then I ran the same resume through sites like Rezi, ResumeWorded, Teal, and Simplify, and suddenly the score dropped to less than half. Each of them then suggested fixes, but only if I paid for a subscription, which is usually around $40 a month. That feels kind of ridiculous when you're actively job hunting and not even working yet.I know Rezi is well-liked on this subreddit. Teal gets a lot of praise on LinkedIn. ResumeWorded pops up in a few other places too. Honestly, it feels like some subreddits are just being run by the dev teams of these resume sites.Out of all of them, I actually like Simplify the most for autofilling job applications. It does about 80 to 90 percent of the work, which is great. But again, the \"pro\" features cost $40 a month.So here's my question: **Is there a good resume tool that actually helps with both autofilling job apps and making your resume ATS-friendly without charging a crazy monthly fee?** I'm not too concerned about the resume template itself. Mine is already clean, has no columns, and is pretty much done.Would love to hear what tools are actually working for people here.",

        "body": "Should I put my software development manager role on my resume if I am looking for a developer role?Seems like a weird question, but i am curious. I am looking for embedded engineering jobs and I am not sure if I should include my management title on my resume. Situation: I have been working for this company for 5 years. 3 years ago my manager left and they decided not to back fill the position. But with that I stepped into more of a leadership role on the team. I went on for about a year and half until I finally discussed it with my boss and he agreed that I had been leading the team better than the previous manager. For the next year I would be dragged along saying my promotion is still with HR and I would follow up ever 2 weeks. Finally at my review in the beginning of the year it went through, but there was no pay increase, just my normal merit increases which I was pissed about because I have been doing the job of a team lead for the past 3 years with no additional compensation. Anyway the promotion was from embedded software engineer to software development manager. But it's more of a team lead / supervisor / product manager role. And I am still performing development tasks.Should I put the software development manager on my resume if I am looking for a developer role? Or should I keep embedded software engineer and just include my leadership responsibilities under that job title?",

Ultimately what we were getting out of that relationship wasn't well aligned with our corporate strategy or mission, so we let it slowly die.> what are currently the most common tasks done and how much of the work is centered around creating code vs model deployment, mathematical computation, testing and verification and other aspects?~80% of the work was exploratory data analysis and \"data munging\". Find the data for the problem you're trying to solve, or question you're trying to answer, and shape it into something complementary to well known modeling and analysis approaches. Most of the actual math being in the EDA phase of the project, most of the actual code being in the \"data munging\" phase of the project.> When you create code for data science and/or ML/AI research, how complex is the code typically?On a scale of 1 to 10, with the 10 being stuff our staff+/principal people typically work on, the actual modeling/munging code is closer to a 3. I didn't understand the math of \"why these features, why these hierarchies, why these parameters, etc\" but debugging/optimizing the code was a \"first 6 months\" thing for me when I joined the team as an IC originally. Granted I had a few YOE under my belt at that point, none of it was at all related to \"data science / machine learning\". First time I ever touched R or used pandas in earnest.Complexity is kinda arbitrary -- my measures are \"what did architecture decide was appropriate resiliency, performance, and test coverage\". Our flagship software has some bonkers design docs and ADRs with SPIRITED DISCUSSION IN THE PRs written up on a regular basis. The inference models we deploy are a 2-pizza typical development team endeavor at most without a lot of staff+/principal people weighing in.> Or is it sometimes instead smaller, simpler with emphasis on optimizing using the right ML or other AI models?Unless you're working on the foundational code/models for LLMs, there's not much of a need to get super-duper into the weeds. A couple hundred lines of (pick your favorite linear regression library + pandas/numpy/R/tidyr/etal) can meet an awful lot of business needs.",

Theres going to be an insane amount of competition for those jobs and it’s really hard to even get an interview with 3 years of experience. More and more companies are going back to in person positions too, so there are less remote jobs in general. I just accepted an offer for a in person position in my local area. Higher paying job than my previous and have the same amount of experience as you. You can look for remote work, but I had a hell of time doing it myself.Edit: I also got my job through linkedin. A recruiter reached out to me. I usually receive 1 - 2 messages a month from recruiters regarding jobs in my local area.",

Expect questions about times you've debugged tricky issues, how you approach learning new technologies, situations where you've had to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and scenarios where you've had to make trade-offs between different technical solutions. They'll probably also probe into your long-term career goals and what motivates you as an engineer.The fact that this person has been involved in your recruiting process means they're already invested in potentially bringing you on board, which is actually a good sign. They'll likely ask about specific projects on your resume and want you to walk through your technical decision-making process in detail. Be ready to discuss not just what you built, but why you chose certain approaches, what you learned from mistakes, and how you'd do things differently now. Since you've made it to the final round, they clearly think you can code - now they want to see if you can think like an engineer and fit into their team dynamic.I actually work on [AI interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), which helps people navigate exactly these kinds of nuanced final-round conversations where the questions can be unpredictable and require thoughtful, detailed responses.",

I was a math major turned cs double major (right at the end) but with no internships because most of my coursework and summers were concentrated on math. Here is my anecdotal experience + experience from friends:If you have published papers or extensive research you could try going to Quant/ML/AI directly. All of my smartest friends were able to do this w/o previous internships but that’s because they had much better research experience than your average good student.If not (like me) and you just had some casual experience, I would just shotgun companies. FAANG is pretty hard (I got someee interviews at these even w/o experience) but there are plenty of amazing companies out there that aren’t FAANG, many of which may be impressed by your background. I myself had little coding work experience and barely knew the tech stack but you will be surprised on how far math experience can go.In general, if you have taken grad level math courses and have some decent projects, I wouldn’t be too nervous. There are plenty of other math individuals who would find this interesting and take a shot, it just might not be as straightforward as the dude next to you with 2 meta summer internships.GL!",
