Therefore the only thing that is controlled is your code.While I see teams go for data quality checks (like DBT tests), I rarely see code testing (doable with dbt-unit-tests, but tedious).",

And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.BUT...Data engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. And within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.The same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. Ditto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. Another angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",

On the brighter side, I can see this area improving in the future given that data quality today, virtually everywhere, is pretty trash. I can see orgs changing their tune here as time goes on. Quality data is gonna matter more and more.",

Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. Obviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.But yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner. I don’t think the execution is locked to duckdb in any way.",

Anyone who tells you they know what's going to happen in the industry over the next 5-10 years is probably wrong. AI will be a disruptor. How significant that disruption will be and what form it takes is still very much a question mark. Turning towards more soft skills with job titles like \"Data Architect\" may insulate you somewhat from that disruption, but as I said, predicting the next few years is very difficult. 3. If you want a masters, do it because you like the subject area and you want to learn about it. If it costs too much then get a hold of the syllabi and read the materials. As someone who hires engineers, masters degrees mean very little to me. Comp sci education is very often a 5 years or more behind current technology and practices unless faculty are direct from the industry. Being 5 years behind in other disciplines is not a big deal.

IMO, the main practical benefit of a PhD is no one will ever suggest you should get more formal education.

This isn't limited to just Data Engineering, this is true for all software engineering practices.There is no one right way to do this, so you'll have to figure out what works for you and your company. Here's a couple of things that have worked for me in the past (does not always work, but you can always try)1. Making them feel the pain - when pipelines break, make it known. Send an incident report email to everyone hen it happens. As you're fixing it, give updates, even if the update is still investigating. If they ask why its taking so long, let them know about the \"right\" work we have chosen not to do, and why it is making things slower to fix. This is especially important on data that is used in highly used reports. Connect these \"best practices\" to things that they care about.2. Insisting on specific practices - sometimes you just need to stand your ground and say THIS IS THE WAY WE ARE DOING THINGS. This is tough to do, especially if you don't have a high position in the company, but from the sound of things, you are the only data engineer, and you are the subject matter expert on the engineering pipelines. You will most likely not be able to say to them that you'll spend a month to \"fix\" the pipelines and make sure they are following best practices, but at the very least, for newer pipelines, you can insist on a few practices. Maybe automated data quality checks and alerts.3. Do things that bring value. While us engineers want to take the time and effort to design things well, and to make sure things are running well, what business cares about is always value - can I get my report in time? Can I trust the data that I see? Any best practice you want to do, or introduce into your work, should always be connected to something that matters to them. There is no use in doing medallion architecture if it means we will need to stall everything for months, without new reports, or fixing current issues. People will be more willing to go with you if they can see that what you want to do will fix issues that they care about. In this case, your lead seems to be focused on the powerBI reports - ask him, what things about the reports are bugging him? what does he think we need to fix in those reports? Can he think of things that will make it easier to build reports? Any dataset that would be commonly used? What issues in the data do they constantly see? If you can connect your practices to these items, it will increase the likelihood of them agreeing with you.Finally though, there is a limit to what you can do. I think a lot of people of this thread has basically said - time to give up, and look for a different job. And there is truth to this - sometimes people just don't know what the best thing to do is, and isn't willing to listen, even to subject matter experts. OR sometimes, they don't care about the long term, and only care about the short term. If your values don't align with theirs - leave. Find a company that cares about what you care about. You can't change everyone.",

One Dataflow Gen2 per table?! That’s rough and you are building up tech debt fast, unmaintainable pipelines, and debugging nightmares might become a way of life. The only winners here are cloud providers raking in cash for unnecessary resources.**A few thoughts:**1. **This isn’t “just” consulting.** You’ll see it in product companies too, but consulting *magnifies* the chaos. **Speed > Quality** every time. The “default tool” is often whatever the least-technical person understands, not what scales. You’re not crazy or missing anything; what you’re seeing is just bad design, period.2. **You** ***can*** **find real data engineering work.** Look for companies that actually value automation, code quality, and actual engineering best practices. Hint: If they use Databricks, Airflow, or even just ADF (with dynamic patterns and metadata logging), you’re more likely to find serious teams. **In interviews,** ask how they handle orchestration, monitoring, and tech debt. If they can’t answer, that’s a red flag... share how you’d do it instead and see how they respond.3. **With your current team:** Quantify the pain. Estimate hours lost to debugging, tech debt, slow refreshes, and cloud spend. Reference stats (e.g., Gartner: bad data/processes cost orgs \\~$13M/year). **Write it up**! Put it in an email, a slide deck, or a doc, so the business impact is clear and visible. Propose practical alternatives: dynamic pipelines, metadata logging, or just consolidating flows so you’re not maintaining 100+ separately. Sometimes, seeing wasted hours or dollars is what finally gets through to non-technical leads.4. **If they won’t listen?** You’ve done your best, don’t let their lack of vision drag you down. There *are* companies that do this right. Weed out the ones stuck in low-code, quick-fix hell.**TL;DR:*** *You’re not broken, the system is.** Don’t settle for shoddy, low-code “data engineering” if you love automation and code.* Use quantifiable pain points to make your case, but start looking for roles at companies with real data engineering maturity.If you want to chat about specific job types or interview questions to weed out the bad fits, DM me.

This usually when a DE is needed for delivering this data.Coming to the engineering part. You are a DE who needs to bring that data in. You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. Now, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.The tasks themselves tend to be \"boring\" compared to swe since they are less \"creative\" and more \"engineering\". You are trying to build something robust and resilient so you have as less maintenance as possible. It's more puzzle solving than creating.",

Obviously you can do your own research and see what we have implemented and compare it to what's publicly available for dbt.SQLGlot, the library behind SQLMesh's SQL understanding has the same \"3 levels\" as Fusion / SDF. We just take slightly different approaches. SQLGlot can parse 20+ dialects. https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/parser.pyIt has type inference and logical planning.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/optimizer/annotate_types.pyhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/planner.pyIt even has a Python based physical execution engine.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/executor/python.pyAt the end of the day, there's been a big media brigade by dbt trying to hype up catching up to us. But it's the equivalent of boasting about making your GPS (compile time of SQL) when your engine is still slow (run time and execution of SQL). dbt core + fusion still doesn't have state. There's no scheduling / cron. So although they can now validate SQL queries, it still can't do something as simple as remembering what days of data your transformations has run for or when it should run. Compile time of SQL queries really should only take a couple of seconds, so they're solving a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place. You're spending minutes/hours, thousands of dollars running queries on your warehouse, and SQLMesh is significantly more advanced there.Happy to chat any time, give me a ping.",

I use Iceberg with Spark, Trino, Snowflake at work. Iceberg works really well with Spark, other client drivers usually are behind.5. Maintanance of small files, compaction, etc [see these docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/maintenance/#delete-orphan-files)I haven't used Singlestore but do not expect OLTP(or clickhouse like speeds from Iceberg.IMO its helpful to avoid vendor lock in (althought I am usually doubtful of these claims, since most vendor data can be dumped out into parquet, or some common standard).As for time travel, its definitely helpful. I've also used SCD2 and kept fact table entries as non immutable past certain lookback time with an etl_inserted column to eseential do time travel (think processing ts column).I'd really nail down the requirements, what does time travel mean to your use case, why do you need it, any other way to easily get what you are looking for? And what is fast mean (under 10s, under subsecond) can you optimize your query to make current system faster; Iceberg will not magically make your queries faster.Hope this helps, lmk if you have any questions.",

On top of that on the application layer it was not noticeable, and on the back end it made it really hard to see what descriptions were being used in the metadata. It so it was kind of like a lose-lose. The only win was where in writing theory if you had to update one description that was the same for multiple models.

If you use something like dbt for transformations then you will have a very different syntax to work with. Someone else mentioned using SQL interview questions and that will help with implementing stuff like window functions.[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/s/HfWY4gOSwo) is a great comment with a list of sample db's you can experiment with depending on what you are using.

I would use learnsql.com for learning and practice and then move onto Data Lemur for more interview style SQL questions. Then if you have more time do one of the Udemy courses so you actually get to setup your own database, play around with loading data into it, messing with indexes, and query execution plans for query tuning.When I was an Analyst, I used to find a couple free datasets, load it into PostgreSQL and just make up business questions about the dataset and then write a SQL query to answer the business question.

I really love their branch based development where you can tested your code with production datasets as input (fall back option) to your current dataset under development. I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. One take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.",

Some years ago I managed a Nifi Cluster and it was a nightmare to document, even more migrate things because there had loads of legacy code embedded everywhere, it was pretty much rewriting everything.",

        "body": "I am going offer a different perspective one that is centered around permissions. Lets say you put your ETL logic inside your orchestrator for 2 use cases1. Extracting data from an RDS instance2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint You have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. But let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.Giving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.",

        "body": "Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the \"when\" something should run (\"run this job daily, but only after X completes\").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the \"what\", \"where\", and \"how\" something runs (\"run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs\").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",

Before jumping into solutioning - what exactly are your requirements? What does your team need you to do with all of these game and practice files?I poked through some of your other posts, and it sounds like what you really need is a scalable storage space for all of your SC files. You can do this cheaply in Azure or AWS (or any cloud provider). I recommend sticking with Azure if that’s where your organization already has its IT centre of gravity. Otherwise you’ll pay money transferring data between the two providers. But if you reply with some additional detail about your requirements, I can help you out more. In other words: what does the team want to do with this data? What capabilities are you expected to provide on top of it? You’re getting posts about setting up a “data warehouse,” but from your post, it’s not clear yet that this solution is actually what you need here.",

My goal from the start was to future-proof the whole setup to be able to handle everything we throw at it, sounds like I might have overshot a bit :) I will keep that in mind though if we do run into problems in the future and the amount of data stays under our expectations.What does the data architecture look like when processing 2b rows per day? I currently have \"copied\" the tables from our products as the lowest layer in our DWH and am then connecting them to several \"datamart\" tables that get used for dashboard/analytics, and in the future ML. Is this enough, even when scaling in the hundreds of dags? Do you use \"intermediate\" layers? And if so which ones?",

        "body": "IMO the data architecture depends more on the complexity of your organization and required analytics than on the data volume. In our case we had gradually accumulated 1500+ DBT models that were split into 3 layers and multiple streams. That was mostly because we had a self service setup where other teams were able to set up their own DBT models.I think the best thing to do when you design your warehouse is to agree on the common business vocabulary. You would be surprised to hear the number of times when different teams disagreed on the definition of a subscription or what a logged in user is. After you have the definitions locked down you can set up a classic 3 layer structure: raw, cleaned/merged and marts. Depending on your situation you might not need the middle layer, but i found that it helps to standardise the data and denormalise it where necessary.",

I think anyone who goes through many rounds of progressively complex technical interviews will logically assume the last one could be the toughest. I personally have had it happen to me more often than I want to remember that the interview process can take an unexpected turn. You’re nervous and you get stuck in your head on what you prepared for, not what’s actually happening. The way I have dealt with this is to make notes about these types of situations and think through how I would have liked to handle it differently next time. I actually review this list of past flubs every time I interview and my own mistakes have made me better over time. In this case obviously it might have been better for you to be able to just take a step back and see you had simple problems in front of you. Or, if you felt uncertain, to say “I see a simple solution to this question or I could offer a more sophisticated approach, do you have a preference for how I tackle it?” But the point is no one answer is going to help you here because the next round of interviews the opposite situation could arise. So I prefer to reflect on all the past weird situations that have arisen in the past before I interview. This alone helps me slow down and expect the unexpected.",

That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.The workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.Obviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.You can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.Then things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for \"things leading to this\" or \"things following this\" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.You can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it. The functions to map all that out, but it is a pretty general dependencies problem so an LLM will likely have something to get you started.",

Think beyond technical requirements and actually understand why you're building something and what value it has to business. Later on you should be sanity checking designs and suggesting improvements. Figure out when it's valuable to push for a change vs letting it be. You're not going to win every argument so save it for when it actually matters. I've had so many junior engineers waste days arguing about some inane shit that doesn't matter in some code that won't be reused anywhere.Actually try to fix things when you have time. Don't just settle for status quo because it's how it's been done. If something is unreliable or breaks a lot think if there's an easy way to fix it or improve reliability.

We take on the work and the risk along with the pay cut, while users expect uptime, features, and support, for free.This isn’t a side project. It’s a full-time job and then some. One that costs attention, energy, and sometimes relationships or families. You do it because you believe in a specific future, and that vision doesn’t always match the one a VC brings to the table. They invest for their outcomes. You build for yours. Somewhere in the middle, you still need to support a community that values freedom, build a product reliable enough to depend on, and fund a team that can keep showing up, all of that while staying sane, healthy etc.It’s a balancing act, between OSS principles, paid offerings, and personal sustainability. Most projects fail at it. We’re trying not to. It’s imperfect, but it’s our best effort.Before you throw stones, look closer.

You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.If you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.The benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. To make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates. The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.I could dig up an example query if that would help.",

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.Hope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",

The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. In other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests.

While visual ETL tools like NiFi/Openflow have clear limitations for teams operating with modern DevOps practices, they do serve a purpose for specific use cases, particularly when you need quick data ingestion without the overhead of building them,.The key is choosing the right tool for your team's scale and engineering maturity.A lot of teams end up with a hybrid approach: using managed connectors for standard data ingestion (like marketing platforms) and custom code for transformations. The everything must be code approach works great at scale, but smaller teams often benefit from reliable, maintained connectors that handle data extraction while keeping the business logic in reviewable code where it belongs.For example, Windsor.ai offers a solution that connects data sources to destinations like Snowflake, BigQuery, or your BI tools. It provides the connector breadth that teams often seek from tools like NiFi, but with API driven architecture that can integrate into data stacks.",

If you want to follow that path you need to add some libraries for logging, something that builds you a DAG (and know when something is up to date) and something that write documentation. For the structure follow something similar to dbt, where are the sources, the transformation (“models”), then tests (data validation).

If your complexity is beyond that you can just containerize it and execute all your updates with one command in whatever way you were planning to execute your Python scripts.

If they don't perform well then I'd consider other packages at that point.

Ssis makes it easy to transform/update multiple tables at once. Python is a much steeper learning curve.

Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.In the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts. Thats where normalization comes in handy.",

Think of the french speaking region of Belgium being in the same marketing region of France while being in a different financial region).Besides that you also have ownership issues. Who controls this dimension and is responsible for its data? What if they decide to change the region of a customer, will that break dependencies from other areas of business?So I agree with her. Keep only things that are relevant and have unified meaning across the business on the silver layer. I would go as far as create multiple dim_customer on the gold layer, one for each department (so, dim_customer_finance, dim_customer_marketing etc) so that, ownership, meaning and purpose of usage becomes clear for everyone who sees the table name itself.",

For example we will have master reference data as a tier 1 being normalized but then a tier 2 wide silver table that uses those tier 1 attributes, but not aggregated yet which would happen in the gold layer for the specific dataset. I think what a lot of articles fail to mention is that bronze/silver/gold will have sub layers to them S well.A good example of this in my platform we have a raw and curated in bronze.

        "body": "My vote would be to keep it all in MSSQL but that’s because I’m an MSSQL DBA. Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!Having an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). But also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. I haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.To expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.It reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).So there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.My patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!So yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt. Just in case it’s a better fit for you.",

And then there was an interview. Was going on well until they said they moved on with someone else. More frustrated than before, I started to give up. But then I started to remember the positives, About what I can deliver as a Lead and how am I really competent. Tried to reflect that in my resume. Imagine being out of work and then applying, that would be even more stressful, so I counted that as a plus too. At work I was just managing and making sure that nobody knew about my job hunt, made sure I was doing just enough. I targeted roles at specific companies and even reached out to recruiters directly, saying in a few lines how well I can fit into the role. By some miracle I got two calls. I was able to convert one. Didn’t have to lower my comp from the current too, however, I did lower my expectations a bit after a while. It was tough and looking back the journey was hard, stressful and brutal.

Then your may want to look into a coherent platform architecture, but for a one-off solution your design is fine.Potential pitfalls I would consider is what happens if your blob files have schema drift and how you then expect PBI to handle it. Also how to handle archiving historical versions and back-filling if needed.",

This greatly reduces cost of cloud computing, but still allows you to take advantage of certain cloud native tooling, such as Power BI connection to database without gateway middleware. There are also some advantages on the data security side of things. I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.Other than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. There are plenty of reasons NOT to do this. I would not recommend this approach unless you have some convincing reason to do so.",

I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus. If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.>Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.>Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity. Some have the mindset that it's \"cheaper\" to avoid vendors and have engineers build everything in-house; in my experience, that math only works if you discount labor costs at 100%. You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB: [https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html) This goes against my advice to do things in-house (although MotherDuck may offer this in a managed solution soon), but if you're not processing multi-TB datasets, DuckDB is very attractive in terms of pricing vs. traditional distributed warehouses.Good luck!",

So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.The second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.So, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.Main 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.Additional sources are:External API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.Series of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.MailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.Got it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.Generally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.Lmao, me neither. The only benefit I see is it makes setting something up a little bit easier.> I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity.

You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.This is something I've realised / been realising. Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.I'll take a look at those names. Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty. A little more feasible, but wouldn't offer as good a feature set as something made for warehousing.> If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDBI've heard a fair bit about DuckDB, it might be time to give it more of a look.",

The data is by-and-large all kept within a Dataverse / D365 instance, although some bits of data are kept external and instead pulled directly into a PBI report.It's a solution that's been built over the course of a fair few years.The end goal would be either finding a new central data store or improving how we use Dataverse as one, and making sure everything is accessible within it.Dataverse / D365 we use generally as a standard CRM. The website contains much of the same information, on top of some additional website specific data: the actual quote requests raised and reported spend being the main pieces.We had originally used a vendor to move from a Dynamics 2014 system to 365 back in around 2020 and the requirement was to make the synchronisation between the new CRM and the website realtime as they shared a lot of data. From what I know, that requirement is intended to stay for the time being.Hopefully, depending on however the solution we end up with shakes up that requirement might change. But generally if say an Account (eg one of our members) has some of their details changed on say the CRM then that change needs to be propagated to the website on-demand rather than on-schedule.I am aware that's a rather big ask. Performing that sync on a scheduled basis with a more meaningful separation between our CRM and web data would probably work better.",

Testing in ADF costs you money. \\* You can develop SSIS solutions on your notebook without any network connectivity in a designer that is a desktop application. ADF designer requires network connectivity and it becomes clunky once you start to create more complex solutions. \\* In SSIS you have a choice of many third-party extensions to use when developing solutions. In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features. Some people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing. I suspect many people are now discovering that having the ability to run SSIS both on-premises and in the cloud is a very attractive feature compared to having a solution that is cloud-only with no ability to transition back on-premises for cost reasons, for example.",

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? - What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? - Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? Generally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.Personally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",

This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.If you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read themThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.---There are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.Uploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.A potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.Another *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.The best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s \"COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\"`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",

It is an outstanding issue due to some difficulty integrating with delta-rs as the writer https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/11039Streaming collect, if it works at all as it doesn't seem to show in the docs, would likely just be a helper toward chunking. It might have an advantage that it can populate the next chunk while you process the current one, but ultimately whatever you send it to will be operating in batches. If you're doing blind inserts chunking should be fine. If you're doing a merge you might want to rewrite a full partition at a time, as repeated chunked merges will waste a lot of time rereading the target data.",

In that case, actually say that they should swap off Polars to use DuckDB combined with DuckLake for their metadata.DuckLake also requires a separate database, which DeltaLake does not, so there's more to do there to make this work. You don't address that at all with the seemingly throwaway comment.> Duckdb can probably handle the out of memory issues better than PolarsWhich you didn't bother to mention in your first comment, so there was nothing there to indicate why DuckDB would be better. That's the kind of information that, if it was included originally, would have avoided downvoting, because it would have presented actual useful information.It is also entirely unsubstantiated, and you've weasel-worded it with \"probably\". Considering [the number of open issues coming up when searching 'oom'](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20oom) I wouldn't put much stock in DuckDB 'probably' handling out of memory issues better than Polars.> as you can chunk the data and duckdb natively streams.Polars natively streams as well. The issue is a specific incompatibility with the DeltaLake writer that prevents it.Perhaps you could have suggested that using DuckDB plus DuckLake would enable streaming writes - if that is even a thing - that could alleviate their issue. That's the kind of information that is useful and would be worthy of an upvote for providing good information. But you didn't bother to actually give any of that reasoning.> You don't think it's close to possible to convert a simple Polars read CSV with duckdb with a simple transformation?That's nothing like anything I said.I was talking about *all* of their pipelines, and the reason for that is that tables stored as DeltaLake need to be read with DeltaLake, and similarly things written with DuckLake will need to be read with DuckLake. It isn't just about this one writer pipeline, it is also about how they *read* their data and *that* process might not be as simple. It is also about their tooling, and whether they want to support multiple different execution engines for their transformations if they're going to make just this one table use DuckDB+DuckLake instead.You're completely ignoring the follow-on effects of switching out your metadata model, and how everything that consumes this data will have to update to use DuckDB+DuckLake. You're also completely skipping the decisions on how to implement the DB that DuckLake works in -- for example will they need to set up an RDS instance for this?These are the kinds of considerations that should be included if you're talking about a complete tech stack change like this. It isn't just a drop-in replacement.---Maybe DuckDB+DuckLake could work for them. There could be good reasons to do it, it could be easy for them if they don't have a lot of pipelines or aren't tightly coupled to Polars. Maybe they have a database already that they could run the DuckLake metadata in.But that's all information that should be included in the suggestion, rather than just a throwaway \"why not use X?\".",

The language was designed with the express purpose of being as difficult to use as possible, going as far as requiring the source code itself to be encoded in a cypher, making it essentially impossible to read. Beyond that, it uses base 3 arithmetic, and essentially requires to use of self modifying code to accomplish most tasks.There are very few programs written in it, with the first hello world program appearing 2 years after the language was published. And that code was not written by hand, but instead generated using a [beam search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) algorithm.If we relax the \"uselessness\" requirements a bit, and focus more on languages that are simply incredibly different from the ones you've learned, there are a lot of potential candidates.[Prolog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a logic programming language where you basically describe the problem and the compiler finds a program that solves it (assuming it has a solution). This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.Similarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this: life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}This example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.You could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.There are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.While I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's \"useful\", I think putting emphasis on the \"uselessness\" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider \"how different is this language from what I'm familiar with\", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.Edit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",

You use it at runtime and include it to do something. (e.g. \"I used the image processing library to sharpen the image.\").An api (application programming interface) is a particular code interface (think logical types and methods/operations) that others on other teams are expected to use. Because of that, the publishing team will promise that changes and especially breaking changes to the interface definition will not be made without notice and time for code bases using it to adapt. When you as a programmer include someone else's library, you would be advised to interact with it through defined apis. If you don't and instead use reverse engineering techniques to find and interact with other internal points like internal methods, services, or data tables, the library publisher may change these at any point without notice and you may have unexpected emergency fixes.Note that something being an api is about the stability and change notification promises not about a particular format, spec, or connection method. An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project. There are plugin apis where you code an extension that implements a published interface and register it using a published json or xml config file. There are data layer apis which are usually sets of tables, views, and stored procs you are to use when extending a product's data model.It's not all about web services and not every web service is an api.",

This fuels the mythology: you’re either a wizard or doomed.Unlike Python or JavaScript, you don’t get guardrails. Crashes, memory leaks, and security bugs are easy to write. Meanwhile, Rust, Go and others provide modern alternatives with safer defaults for many tasks. Python and Java are easier for most high-level work. So for hobbyists or self-learners, Python is simply a better first (or second) language. C++ is like learning calculus before arithmetic.But C++ still does matter. There is a ton of existing code written in C++ that needs maintaining and the language is still unmatched in performance-critical domains. And there is a lot of learning value in it.

        "body": "I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the \"safe\" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.There are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.So all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.I could go on. But the overall point is that1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.C++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",

This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. Barring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. Yeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. The language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. But most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution. It's just that the right solutions aren't the obvious ones.",

No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.What you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.And not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.And remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!update : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",

Also, you’ll invariably run across things in your life & career where the ability to write a little script or program will save you tons of time, effort, or money.Python is a great choice because it’s a very generalized language. There are great libraries to do all sorts of things. And once you learn it, you’ll be able to pick up other programming languages you might need without too much trouble. Like, if you end up working with Excel a lot, then learning VBA to make complicated macros won’t seem at all intimidating.",

When you get stuck, do some googling on it, find some example code that is similar and make some changes to it and see what happens. I find it's much easier starting out of it's related to something you're interested in (example, if you like sports make a hockey league with different teams that have different attack and defense ratings and program it to calculate a way to determine which teams would win against each other).I'm sure some others will have better answers, but this helped me feel a lot more comfortable with what I was learning.",

If you need to, just latch onto the first project you see on the subject that way the choosing part of the project doesn’t prevent you from the *doing* part of the project. Worst case scenario, try to recreate a project you saw on YouTube or something. Even if you break things, that’s better than nothing.

In my classes, we always started with a program called “stop-go”; when the microcontroller turns on, there’s a red LED on. When you press a button, the red LED turns off and a green LED turns on.

The idea is a set of concentric circles, like an archery target - in the middle, the bullseye, is what you, the learner, can do without any assistance, around that is the ring of **proximal development**, what you can do with guidance, and around that is all the things that you cannot do (yet).When learning something new it is important to start from the middle, and work your way gradually outwards - everytime you learn something, the bulls eye gets larger, and so does the ring around it, meaning that you can learn even harder stuff.As a teacher it is important to guide the students to this zone - my students tell me that I keep them on the very outermost edge of it - but when you are learning by yourself, it is harder to plan ahead. You don't yet know how complicated something outside of that zone might be, how far away it is, and how much else you need to learn before.So - to sort of answer your question:>So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler?By gradually making projects that are harder and harder, always make sure that you know how to build *most* of it, but that there's some aspects you don't yet know how to do. And then you research those specific parts, using books, tutorials, ask around and so on. And you learn something. Then you either build a new project, or expand on the one you already have, and learn yet more things!The same way you'd \"bridge the gap\" from fixing a puncture on your bicycle, to being a formula one car mechanic - by learning more and more and more - and at some point taking a dedicated class, course or job in exactly that, but there's usually no straight line!",

You don't have to 100% know how to do it from the outset. Start working on what you know how to do and figure out the parts you don't when you come to them.

What that really means is *you’re not standing out yet* — and maybe you’re not putting in enough work. If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.Think about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.Your first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.I’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.I tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.There are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.My first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.I’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.So I’m saying this: If you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it. You have to grind. Not for weeks. Not for months. **For years.**Are you willing to do that? Shiii I was diong this homeless. But yea have to put in the work because if you don't even the people who would like to help you wont because your not helping yourslef. Networking is good as a dev because you can work on projects with devs , you can work on projects with ui/ux designers etc . They'll reach out after if they don't its fine. Even if you network with busienss people you can get work though them . Sometimes it not about being good its about communicating and getting the job done because poeple don't understand what they are looking at in terms of code they look at results .

I'm not saying that these aren't good places to start, they really are, but they need to be used as the baseline for a least a year of extra learning or hardcore personal portfolio creation.Not to be harsh here, but you got advertised to by Udemy and they gave you expectations that were way too high. I think next steps to get a job are A: go to some form of higher education. B: work your ass off doing personal projects.That being said, this market is extremely saturated at the moment and if you got sold comp-sci solely as an easy industry to get into, maybe think hard about if you really enjoy doing it.

That's exactly what I did and I don't have any certificates, college education, etc. I basically found a small web developer shop that did websites for local businesses and offered to work part-time on a contract basis and cut my teeth on developing POS and/or internet ordering systems for them, and then leveraged the experience I got working with payment processing to get a job as a junior engineer at an actual payment processor. From there, I have had no trouble finding work as a software engineer.Maybe it is harder these days - maybe there are even people lining up to do the free or low-cost work to build up a portfolio. Other posters here make it sound like it's a moonshot. Is it harder than when I got started? Probably. Is it fair? No. But what are your other options?

You constantly need to babysit it, because it's so stupid and its coding makes no sense. >I’m scared that it’s too late in 2025 and that I’m too old (I’m 27).Well, sounds like you're about 50 years in the clear. >I find it very demotivating when people say working with AI is more important than learning a programming language itself.Wait, why would this be demotivating?>I’m not sure if, as someone with zero experience in programming, it’s wise to start directly with C++.Sure, if you need it.

Unless the technology is absolutely perfect, there's no future for the industry without seniors. If they retire and you have not trained any juniors to replace them, your company is screwed.The second major thing is responsibility / ownership. You want people to be responsible for things - delegating the responsibility of ensuring things get done and that they are correct. Ai in 5 years most likely will not be able to replace a person at determining the correctness of some code. The best path forward is to keep an eye on the tools. Learn on your own but also try the tools since that may be expected at your first job. Also good to identify where ai makes mistakes. The best way to not worry is to observe that for yourself. If you ai doesn't make mistakes then you are a god among vibe coders and your future is safe either way.I would recommend windsurf. The best option might change over time, but currently for windsurf you can purchase their lowest tier subscription and get unlimited use from their base model. If any kind of expense is a problem, then use a normal code editor and ask a free ai service for code, like perplexity or Google or Bing. I used windsurf to build a reddit scrubbing tool and it struggled a lot with building the rate limiting code. Without my knowledge, if that was a project someone built for a customer, it would be fine for a few seconds until it burst past the call limit per second and got the tool rate limited or blocked. It needed 3 or 4 attempts to implement an ok solution - and that is with heavy guidance in a single, small function.",

At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.First thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more \"essential\", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).And in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a \"cheap high-quality on-demand agency\", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put \"will doctors\" into Google search, the first result is likely \"will doctors be replaced by AI\".Being concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of \"AI replacing developers\". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.Being concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a \"ceiling\" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.Overall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.Edit: grammar",

That role is absolutely critical, since AI can't take over management, and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the technology get built and solves the problem you think it does.So how has AI changed out life? I write code faster (for some things), I get better search results, and I can have in-depth conversations about parts of my life I wouldn't otherwise talk about, with an agent that is willing to walk through very specific scenarios for hours and hours.As for other people, my job is to basically use LLMs to save costs. We don't need to automate away a full job for their to be fewer people hired, we just need to take a fixed cost center and figure out how to do the same thing for less effort. That story is already playing out: we don't lose the job, we just get more than less.If you want to go into CS, just know that you are signing up for one of the fastest moving fields ever created.

None of this involves actually writing code, more so understanding the problem and breaking it down to a manageable level. It's okay if you only understand a bit here and there over the course of several days or even weeks. I get easily distracted as well so I'll just pick at the code. For example, reading a function then walking away and thinking about how it works and fits into the entire file while I'm washing dishes or something. I keep doing this until my natural curiosity and hyper focus takes over and I ride that until I'm tired.I'll also watch tech videos or listen to tech related books/podcasts. Not directly productive, but passive learning is better than nothing and it helps my mind stay occupied with tech.Sometimes going down learning rabbit holes of adjacent stuff can help break up the monotony of whatever task. Like learning more about networking, business, or a different stack/language may help with the bigger picture even if it doesn't help with your programming right now today.Doing something is always better than doing nothing even if it's not directly the task at hand or if you don't work on it that long.",

There's literally no point to this. Know enough to be proficient but no need to focus too much on it. Syntax is translating your thinking into code the environment understands. If you have nothing to think, why exactly are you thinking about the syntax? You need to focus on learning to think algorithimically first, then syntax will flow.How it works in my brain at least: - Abstract thinking about \"thing\" - Translate \"thing\" into Syntax A for programming language A - Translate \"thing\" into Syntax B for programming language B - etc.An analogy is someone who's fluent in a foreign language but not bilingual. They usually still think mostly in their mother tongue but apply a transformation of their original language to the target language.",

I started with that as well as C. This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java. It's all good stuff to know, but certainly not a requirement. If anything, can make you really appreciate everything these higher level languages are doing for you.",

If I could do it over again, I would just go do a masters at somewhere like Georgia Tech, be done in 2 years, and who knows, maybe be working in the industry by now.Yes you can do projects and that will help some, and you should absolutely do that whether you go for the degree or not. But having a masters from a reputable university will help you get your foot in the door, clear hiring screens, etc. There are also plenty of affordable programs from highly-regarded public universities for you to choose from, so cost shouldn't be that big of a deterrent. The one caveat is that you do already have a STEM bachelors (which I don't have), so *maybe* you could pull it off if you leverage that plus some quality self-studying. But in this job market, I still think a masters is going to be your best bet.",

Especially nowadays where the cost of degrees are astronomical compared to what I paid (I graduated in 2010 and paid off my degree through work contributions alone in 2018). As a PHP developer you will have some income and also proven time spent actually doing development. As you get further and further into your career the fact you have a degree becomes less and less important. The only thing I would say that you would benefit from perpetually from a degree is learning the fundamentals as in my experience self taught engineers often skip a lot of these and struggle at certain points in their career when these fundamentals become more important (switching languages, architecture etc). Id also say that in my experience a lot of people doing ML / Machine learning that I encountered in the wild aren't actually people with Computer Science degrees they tend to be mathematicians. Two very different disciplines despite what people say (I'm awful at maths as I'm dyscalculic but really good at software development as it's more akin to algebra).",

It is not that you \"must\" learn DSA to know how to write programs, but it will probably enrich your knowledge base, enhance your problem-solving skills, and give you an understanding of the performance implications of different data structures and algorithms.Having a \"side project\" is orthogonal to learning about different programming concepts. Having your own project allows you to challenge your assumptions of how things work, put into practice what you have learned (and learn even more from your own mistakes).You may check the FAQ (in the sidebar); it has, for example, a section on different exercises and project ideas that can be helpful.",

There are easier ways to do that.The answer still is personal projects. Data structures and containers are much better to learn when considering your project's requirements and tailoring them to fit it, than memorizing different types of data structures and containers while having no clue about how and when they would actually be best to use over the alternatives. And conclusions you reach on your own you will memorize and internalize much better than conclusions you reach because a book told you that that's how it works, which might or might not even be correct.",

He told me to chose one and I chose websites. He then told me that I should start remaking websites, not large ones like amazon, facebook, netflix, but to look at local businesses and remake their sites. Find what works and what does not work, make them better in either design or functionality.I did that for a few sites, one day it clicked and I got comfortable with building and designing sites from scratch. I learned to make a custom PHP framework then moved on to using Laravel.I would suggest the same, make some clones, learn how other applications did the same thing, build up your personal library and enjoy what you build.

Grind the idea down to the bare minimum, something you think you can build.Then, once you've built that, begin to add features - what would you also like to happen in the game?

You already have a bit of knowledge but that will go through all the basics. I went back to college after doing CS50x and we started with Java and SQL in there. C is a lot more low level so it’s a bit harder but it was a great foundation and I understood a lot more concepts on how things work and why they work the way they do. Maybe someone else here will tell you to do the python one but I’d get a decent grasp on one of the languages first. It’ll make life a lot easier when you start to branch out.",

What I write in them is after the lesson and try to recall and build based off the topic. I then call said lesson and if it fails or doesn’t give me what I want, or I get stuck before then, I watch the lesson again to solidify my understanding and resume the code block until it runs like intended.After a certain amount of lessons, since they tend to build on each other, I get an idea of something I could try and make a MiniProject method/function trying to combine all the previous lessons and building from scratch. Then rinse and repeat. I was tired of just copy pasta tutorial videos and then not being able to recall anything. Now I can print “Hello, World!” with confidence :)I eventually plan to go back at the end when I finish the whole tutorial/lesson/class on what I’m watching (like 4-8hrs of said programming language) to refactor and make all the lessons and mini projects code to be more efficient. And that’s in hopes of refreshing concepts as I clean the code getting some hands on experience, even if not crazy complex.An example: at the end of my current YouTube class/lesson, or maybe in the middle when topic is touched, I plan to somehow create an array or some data structure to be able to rotate my lessons/miniprojects to run and output instead of hard coding each function I want to run. If that makes sense. So I’d implement concepts I learn with my own notes.",

I have a file alongside each project outlining exactly what’s going on as I work on the project. 1) explain the concept, goals, success factors and a note on what I might need and what I want to learn2) I usually have a design drawn out separately but I’ll write a brief summary of how I intend it to work, classes that will be used and key methods or functions. 3) start a diary for each day or section. This is handy for showing what I was working on and how I approached it but also good practice for getting back into it quicker and having a clear view of where you are in the projectYou don’t have to be working on something new each day. Your having trouble with something explain it (you might find the answer while you talk through it), show each approach you went through and if you have to go back and change something earlier in the project hilight it and make a note on that entry incase you go back to check it. Again not every day needs to have an entry, just add onto the end on the one you’re working on if it’s a continuation. 4) At the end write a summary of how the project went. You successfully created x which did y and z. These are the things that tripped me up. This is how I got around it. This is what I’d do differently going forwardAnd these are things I’d like to improve. It seems like a lot of work at the start but it makes it way easier to track what’s going on and you can see find stuff easier when you’re looking back for solutions in the future. I probably should call it something other than notes.txt so it stands out in the future but it’s a good trace of how you work and proof you actually did it.",

Somewhat related to this, you could look into functional programming, it often has the same feeling as learning math.With languages you already know, if you are interested in physics or have taken physics, a cool project is to code up some kind of physics simulator whether it's gravity and particles, fluid, etc. You'll learn about ways to numerically solve differential equations to a high degree of accuracy (like the Runge Kutta method), how to structure your program in an efficient way, various data structures etc.",

You seem to imply that either you find something boring or too complex, meaning, the ones you find interesting are unfortunately too complex or out of scope for you to do.Maybe make a list of the interesting but \"too complex\" projects you find, and see if you can either find a common theme to inspire you, or if there are some of them you can simplify and start out with on a smaller scale.For example, let's say you find the thought of building a game interesting, but, games are too big and complex. Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. Some part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",

Or, focus on security or DS like you mentioned, these have nothing to do with front end.2. There are like a million CSS frameworks and other front end technologies that exist, I think not a ton of people really spend time tinkering with this stuff directly as a career. Similarly, you can have a UI without being a front end expert, just keep it very basic, like just use a template and be done.3. You can just have projects with no UI, this is extremely common. In fact, a project should really just solve one little tiny problem if possible, and if someone else wants to make a separate project that wraps your project with a UI then fine.4. Not that this probably matters for you, but there is a subtle difference (front end devs can correct me if I'm wrong) between front end software dev versus UI/UX design. You can design for functionality (and performance etc.) on the front end without really worrying about the design itself. You can conversely design a UI without getting into the functionality or even writing any code.",

It's rare for people to just be able to install whatever they want. You might need to check with someone to see if you can install some kind of python runtime environment. Even if you can't though, there's plenty of online python environments (Google Colab is a big one).If you really want a job as a SWE, you probably should still invest time into web development. There's plenty of web devs that feel the same as you (they hate frontend), and many people have come up with different ways to streamline that process (component libraries, frontend frameworks, etc.).If you want to get into data science though, you should look into more \"data science career\" related material.

C++, when written in a C++ style, is more of a high-level language that abstracts most of the complexities of low-level memory management away.But, C is contained within C++. There is no real reason to write in C over C++. Even if you write in a very C style, the ability to use C++ templates and lambdas is a massive advantage that you'd almost be silly to not take advantage of, as you aren't losing anything for doing so. And references also work to clarify intent in comparison to raw pointers. Some things, such as complex initializations of constants, are impossible in raw C due to the lack of lambdas, unless you write an actual function for it. As for hardware limitations, the languages are similarly performant and it does not matter.",

That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.Since you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school\" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.You’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Just keep following your curiosity, and you’ll build the skill stack naturally.Good luck, and keep building :oncoming_fist:",

I look for what seems exciting or relevant to the kind of software I might want to build.For example, I wanted a personal website, which led me to Eleventy. I tried to dive in, read some docs, and attempt small things, until I realized that I was really struggling to get what I wanted. I then looked for a tutorial that builds a complete project, so I could get a notion for what it could look like. When doing tutorials, I try to actively change minor things, add small features, or try to integrate it with something else. I like doing this because it forces me to understand why it works and make it my own.I wholeheartedly agree with project-based learning. I also like to say that you should embrace failure and be quick to abandon learning projects if they're not serving their purpose (i.e., you're not learning or enjoying the process). The goal is learning, not necessarily something you'll put on your portfolio.",

I think you should set a time limit and learn so while you’re learning you write down all the things you’re curious about and then you go into them one by one after you’re done with objective task. An hour of the quest and 30 mins for the side quest. If you stay consistent enough you will learn a lot and understand lots too. This way you learn what you have to learn and also satisfy your craving to go down the rabbit hole. Happy learning mate!",

The time which is challenging to do in the work , so that in the back of your mind , u always have a goal to do things in a natural way and not get deviated by random thoughts.If u have not given it a fixed time , it is basically infinite,so if u can never say that the work is complete. You see? We can never complete a work without deadline.Setting a deadline or giving a fixed time makes it look unimportant after that which helps you to complete it within that time bound.Even if it is 10 hours or 1 hour or just 30 minutes. Keep track of time.",

Would recommend learning a bit of C before tackling a project like developing a kernel - C programming will force you to learn some systems concepts, but it’s still a “high level language” that can be used for many of the same things that Java can be used for. For learning C, check out books like Modern C or K&R. For learning systems, check out courses/materials online. I recommend Nand2Tetris, it’s a wonderful resource. There’s no reason you can’t learn C and learn systems at the same time, but it helps to have some familiarity with how C works before diving into a really complex systems project like an OS kernel",

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.I have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**Later on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.Years later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.Ironically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable. To share if you feel lost, or don't understand something that everyone else seems to. You are on the long road to becoming an expert. Give yourself grace.",

And pretty much everyone I've seen who thinks they have it, doesn't actually have it either.They're merely recent graduates who've hit the point on the Dunning-Kruger curve where they're correctly realizing how little they know about CS, and feeling overwhelmed. Their feelings of inadequacy are completely justified because they **are** literally beginners, and now they're understanding that completing a 3 year degree doesn't mean they know everything.Or they're too young to understand that the top 1% of any field are outliers, and everyone else is just a regular human who makes mistakes and doesn't know everything. Basically they haven't yet mentally grown out of the phase where they think parental figures are magical perfect beings, they've just replaced their actual parents with like, a senior colleague, or some YouTuber. But hey, better that pirate software guy than fucking Peterson or Tate right? Then their idol either quits or fucks up, and after a short existential crisis they realize they were just normal people after all, boom no more \"Imposter Syndrome\".Or they've grown up with social media, where your understanding of the world is warped by selection bias. User X is an expert in A, user Y is an expert in B, user Z is an expert in C, they conflate it into some amalgamation of everyone knows everything. Then they get a job in the real world and find out individual people are good at maybe a few things, but really fucking stupid at everything else.TL;DR as far as I can tell 99% of \"Imposter Syndrome\" is just young people lacking cognitive development and real world experience to understand they have every right to feel less capable. They literally are. That's why we pay them less. If you're asking questions on this sub, chances are you fall into at least the first category, if not the others as well.",

But that's not something you'd know just because you knew C/C++.Different interviewers have very different styles, and also, many interviewers are bad at it and will reject you more or less randomly.

Not advanced stuff.\\~15 minutes of role-related knowledge questions. Again, the goal is to see if their resume is correct. So if they say they worked on a graphics driver for a certain operating system, I would ask them basic questions that someone who worked on that should know the answer to.\\~60 minutes for a coding question. I would ask a question that a seasoned professional could solve in 10 minutes. The extra time was to allow the candidate to take time to disuss the problem, maybe have a false start or two, and still have plenty of time to get to a working solution.My general advice: Try to relax. Try to think out loud if you can - the interviewer is probably trying desperately to figure out how you think about problems and whether you consider alternative solutions and tradeoffs between different ways of answering questions or solving problems.",

Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. I think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them.

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

How do you justify if it’s a good looking car? Well the only way that you could do so is you need to have a reference point of what is “good” and what is “bad”. It’s the same case with these concept. If you never encounter a “problem” in an OOP language code base. You will have no idea how OOP concept will solve those problems. The easier way to move forward is find a project or build one NOT using an OOP. Once you build to certain level, stop and look at how your code wired together. Does any of the OOP concept that you know can make your code “better”.",

Another more accurate name for these constructs is Inversion of Control (IoC) and this idea came about because of TDD, and the need to inject objects to help separate production and testing environments.IMHO this design patterns actually go against classical OOD, which defines concepts like 'has a' and 'is a' as the types of relationships objects have with one another. Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.Now the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.Once you understand this, it makes a lot more sense. The IoC takes care of the construction of the object, and everything else is OOD.",

Try building a small project in one giant file, and then refactor it: split responsibilities, name things more clearly, add a function here or a class there. It’ll start to click why we abstract once you’ve experienced what it’s like not to.",

If you look under reviews they have a picture of some guy with a title and a quote. They never mention the name of the company that these people supposedly work for.

As you become a better programmer, you should be able to \"run code in your head\", envision how it will work, and how it achieves your goal.If something isn't working right, that means there's a gap in your mental model — something in the code that you are understanding differently than how it actually is. You should seek to close that gap by understanding *why* it works differently than you expected, so that you can pinpoint the exact wrong assumption or belief that you had.Disclaimer — obviously, you can't know every piece of knowledge about every tool — you need to decide what is \"out-of-scope\" for you. As a programmer, at least your entire chosen programming language should be in scope for you.For example, I work in TypeScript, so for any issue that I run in to in my TypeScript code, I make sure to fully dig into it so that I can improve my mental model for next time. However, if my code encounters an issue when deploying to a Linux server, I may decide that I don't have an interest in Linux servers at the moment, so I might spend less time digging deeply to understand everything there is to know, or I may ask my co-worker who may be more experienced in Linux.",

If you use the native Apple environment, you get the simplest, highest quality and best-performing app building blocks with proper UI look-and-feel, reusable components for common tasks, smooth UI animations, etc. as well as skills that are valued on the commercial job market. Your solution will not be cross-platform, though. If you go the non-Apple framework route, such as Flutter, React Native or .NET, you will indeed build a cross-platform app, but one that sometimes might not look or behave the way iOS users expect it to or might not be as performant. Finally, every time someone suggests a programming language or an SDK to learn and use, make sure to check how many jobs are available for it on the open market compared to analogous mainstream technologies.",

It’s somewhat similar to Java from what I’ve heard so you shouldn’t have too much trouble. They have their own proprietary IDE called XCode that you might want to check out if you want to build iOS apps in the way god intended. I know there’s also plenty of tutorials out there on how to get started with XCode.If you want to make cross-platform apps that work on non-apple devices too, you’ll have to go a different route. Annoyingly, XCode only runs on MacOS too so if you don’t have a Mac you’re out of luck.Lots of cross platform apps these days like discord start out as web apps since so many people know web development, and use a framework like React Native or Electron to transform those apps into things that run on all sorts of other platforms, so you could start out by learning some basic web scripting in HTML, CSS and Javascript. This road is a lot longer and more confusing though if you’re just looking to make a simple mobile app.",

When you are then ready to move onto a more robust backend and need something more powerful / designed for the task then go with C# or Go. If it's not the web side you are looking at then stick with Python as a scripting language then move onto something deeper like Go or C# (.net) or Java.",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.Being able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"You have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.It definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

You shouldn't ask AI to guide you, as it can lead to heavy reliance and possibly prevent you from learning anything. I think you should learn the basics, get an idea for a project, and work on it.Let's say you learn variables and conditions. What can you do with those two things? Build a calculator? Make a FizzBuzz game?Hopefully, you get the point; learn a concept and get your hands dirty. That's the way to learn. Don't half-ass your classes either; if the lectures are boring, then maybe watch a YouTube video on that topic and move along.",

        "body": "Avoid AI for most of your project. I’m in a similar boat to you going back to college and ya AI is a great tool to help get through it but your not actually learning that much by tweaking the code after it spits it out. There’s a lot more to learn in how to take an idea and how to start making it. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is in planning and design. Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?Learning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. You won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. I also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. The best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. We had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?” I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. They loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. When it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. TLDR:Don’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects. Keep pushing in college, you might be ahead right now but that’ll slip real quick it you get lazy",

Experience is second to none, and making a project will allow you to learn key concepts in a practical setting. For example, you could download Visual Studio or CLion and start creating a simple CLI application (e.g., FizzBuzz, Rock Paper Scissors) to become familiar with C++'s syntax. Then, if you want to incorporate some OOP principles, you could create a more complex program that involves abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and/or polymorphism.If you need ideas for projects, you can google \" beginner projects.\" You're bound to find one that catches your eye. And if you ever get stuck on something, just google \"how to X in Y,\" where X is some task (e.g. use a switch statement), and Y is the programming language you are working with.TLDR: courses are beneficial, but they are even more helpful when supplemented with practical work and experimentation.",

You just need to learn to live with it and take the challenges step by step.In programming, you will never stop learning and will always be fighting an uphill battle as there is always way more that you don't know than what you do know. There is always a huge mountain ahead of you. Yet, if you take it like you climb a mountain by looking at the path, the steps ahead of you instead of looking at the seemingly unreachable summit, everything becomes much more manageable.Also, too many people in programming are *afraid*. Afraid of not living up to the(ir) expectations. Afraid to break things. Afraid for completely irrelevant reasons.There is nothing to be afraid of in programming. Unless you do some incredibly stupid things (like deleting random files, or formatting your computer) nothing serious can happen. The worst case is that you need to restart the computer, so what?You need to shift your mentality about failures: with every failure, with every error, with every thing that doesn't work like you expected, you have learnt something. You have learnt how not to do things. This is equally important to knowing how to do things.If you mess up something, you'll remember.

You have no idea what language or framework it might use, or what the person who originally wrote it was thinking.Experienced programmers who have done a little of everything are great at stuff like that. They can make good money because they can quickly figure it out and solve the problem in a few hours. Meanwhile a junior programmer might spend a week just figuring out how it works.So yeah - early in your career it's usually the best move to get a full time job so you can gain experience and learn from other programmers. Once you're more skilled, freelancing or consulting or starting a business are totally options.A lot of us do stick with employment, though, because it pays really well with less risk.",

        "body": "First off if you are in Russia you already have problems that can't be addressed here but will impact your ability to earn a living.If I understand your question correctly the answer is NO you can't just jump into freelance work with no education nor training. To get more specific there is a very wide range of what could be considered web site development some or which requires little in the way of programming skill to that which requires a team for timely delivery. The no skill web sites are often the low pay web sites you can't live off.As I see it and the big problem I have with your post, is that you don't want to learn and become a professional, this is a huge problem. If you really want to go into business for yourself you need a 4 year degree in some CS discipline. That degree should contain a minor in business management. You simply will not be able to compete for the lucrative jobs with targeted education. So you really need to address your position on education, if you are not willing to get a college degree in a CS program then you should consider something else. Maybe basket weaving.So back to your very first question, \"can a programmer work for himself\". You certainly can but you need to have developed the skill set before you go out on your own. Even then you need to know the technology on a professional level. People that do this sort of thing, that is create their own companies have personality characteristics that allow them to be successful. You have to be driven and frankly wear many hats. One of those hats is customer relations and that is a lot harder than many imagine. In business for yourself you are not just a programmer, you need to come off as a professional that can grasp the potential customers needs. If you come off as a flunky that took a Python course and thinks he is a GOAT then you will have a hard time even drumming up business.",

Then you go to the youtube mentor to basically to do the thinking of picking a project for you. Now, you're coming to us to tell you what we think you should do about staying in the course or doing this other project. So, I want to address my guess as to what the foundation of your issue is. You just need to pick something, anything and move forward. You don't need to worry if you stop or quit because something else sprouts out of the side of that. It's even ok if you move on to something else (if you're doing it because that drew your interest). Just program. The issue is that new ideas won't come to you until you get more experience coding and playing around. You'll be working on a website, learn about networking and then think... 'hey I wonder if I could create a program that would connect my two laptops in a way that.........'. Or you'll be using a database and think... 'could I put a layer in front of that which handles X case?'. You'll get frustrated running a shell command and as part of script to install a separate project and wonder if you could edit its source code to alter something. Just learn and practice. The ideas will come. Get over your perfectionism or you'll stand still.",

I usually begin with a well-regarded book written by someone who really understands the technology (ideally someone with deep experience). Books like that often go beyond the surface level stuff you'll find in tutorials, and that depth has always helped me.No matter what tools or frameworks you explore later, I strongly recommend getting really comfortable with at least one programming language. That solid foundation will make it much easier to pick up new technologies down the road. From what you've shared, I'd say focus on either Python or Java for now. Both are powerful, widely used, and have a lot more to offer than most people realize at first.Once you're confident in one language, you'll be in a better position to understand how and when to use other tools specially in project-specific contexts.You'll hit plenty of bumps down the road, so no need to get frustrated this early on. :)",

When people program for Android, for example, they use a desktop system for the development and then \"deploy\" to the Android target; I've never heard of anyone developing Android apps on an Android itself. The problem is that programming languages, compilers, IDEs, editors, etc. are all designed with keyboards and mice in mind, not touchscreens; they make heavy use of symbols which are awkward to access on a touchscreen; and things like touchscreen autocomplete and autocorrect, designed for texting and natural language, will be more of a hindrance here than a help, in my opinion.If you cannot afford to or do not want to get your own desktop or laptop computer, I would advise going to a local library and using one of the machines there.",

For instance, if I'm unable to find a technique that might possibly work, I'm hosed until I find one or re-frame the problem to side-step it.",

Exceptions include jobs that have requirements other than knowledge: I’ll probably never be an NFL linebacker or king of England no matter how much I study.I think the more useful question is: *how hard is it to acquire enough knowledge to switch to another field?* How hard would it be for a cybersecurity developer to switch to web development? How hard for a web developer to learn cybersecurity?",

But if you don't know the math behind 3D graphics, then that limits what you can do.You might have to work with some library or framework. That can take time to learn. Some are easier than others. The more complex the problem domain (I don't like your definition of domain--to me, domain refers to the subject area the program is about, not the syntax), the harder it is to get into.For example, a while back, face recognition was difficult. Most people who wrote a program that attempted face recognition were PhDs in the area.There are so many kinds of problems out there that there's bound to be one that you have no clue how to do. For example, there are open math problems. Can you write a program that proves or disproves the Goldbach conjecture? No one has proven it. It's a problem. Problem solving only gets you so far because you have to have an idea what to do.",

When you have extensive expertise in a particular domain, you'll have insights into what approaches will or won't work, what customers actually need, etc. that people outside that domain wouldn't have.* Could a strong programmer solve most LeetCode puzzles regardless of their specialty?I'd say all strong programmers should be able to get a correct answer to any LeetCode puzzle. Not everyone practices finishing them in 45 minutes, but solving them in a reasonable time period, sure.As for finding the optimal answer, I'd say most strong programmers could get the optimal answer to most LeetCode problems, but (1) some strong programmers are very good at their job but do very little DS&A, and (2) some LeetCode problems are quite tricky and even strong programmers wouldn't figure out the \"trick\" to the optimal solution.* If a cybersecurity developer wanted to switch to web development, would their main hurdle just be learning the new domain knowledge, or are there deeper skills that don't transfer?It'd say it's mostly just domain knowledge.",

But yes, I do think that core problem solving skills translate well to most domains and learning the domain specific details is the main hurdle.

The math with 6% cost of capital (what big tech pays on their debt) amounts to a 10% hit.3. Only a portion of the salary is affected. For example, time spent fixing bugs, helping write stories, grooming, providing support, etc does not qualify. Back end work would be more likely to qualify and front end work less likely.Lets say only 55% of your work is affected by R&D Capitalization. Over 5 years, the impact to the company is that they'll pay 5.5% more of your salary. So no, this isn't fueling mass tech layoffs.",

If I am XYZ Consulting and I have 10 devs on payroll, I can't replace them with the expensive model. I can 5x or 10x their productivity if I provide them the expensive model as a work tool. If the big AI providers keep trying to convince me to replace my guys with AI, if I haven't taken the bait yet, chances are I am not going to. Now they need to sell me the tool.",

A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very \"normal\" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make \"2x or 3x\" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by \"most\" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.* Now you're just saying \"White Collar careers are the best careers by far\". This has nothing to do with SWE.* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. \"I work for Google\", \"Cool, what do you do there?\", \"Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments\".It's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like \"best\", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.*Your* \"best\" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's \"best\" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.If you enjoy SWE, pursue it. There's really no point in trying to argue it's the objectively \"best\" field. Let people do what people want to do with their lives.",

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the \"but china\"-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant \"refunds\", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",

Then again, 0% interest rates already sounds unsustainable.My hypothesis for the bad market:1. Too much new grads and bootcampers, entry is impossible. Add on to the tax code, there are fewer positions than before.2. Most software already exist, cheaper to pay subscription for a software another company made rather than hire more SWEs. Most seniors with 20 yoe just maintain old software these days (remember that one Google article?), if not that they are getting laid off and then the junior market becomes impossible.",

When you're growing, you need to hire a lot of people to take bit bets on many projects. You have to pay more and making interviewing less frictionful if you're hiring a lot of people. If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways. For startups and not yet profitable, growth companies, this makes it more financially challenging to operate. It also pushes them toward profitability and cost cutting, but this may not be viable for more growth-oriented business models.",

Recruiter: “Hey we have this role open [title] that we think you’d be good for, can we talk?”Me: “I’d like to know TC, location, company details, project/product first please.”Recruiter: “here’s the job description!” Me: “yeah cool I meet or exceed everything on that list, it sounds junior for me tbh but you’re asking for someone with 5-8 YOE for that? Also, you still haven’t told me the TC range.”Recruiter: “can you tell me what you’re expecting?”Me: “it doesn’t work like that. Per California law you post the range with the job. You’ve now told me the job, contracting agency, and end customer are all in California. *What is the pay range for this role?*”Recruiter: Me: “that’s way too low for this, thanks but I’m no longer interested.” That scenario has played out maybe 5-10 times over the last year almost verbatim. The last one tried to pull the car sales “let me speak to my senior manager and see what we can do…” and I just stopped responding. 100% of these recruiters have been Indian, educated solely or primarily in India, with work experience primarily or at least initially in India.

When stack ranking came around, one of the non-Indian team members was piped to further the Indian take over. My friend said this was a common occurrence throughout the company. Should you take the job? Only you can decide, but I hope the preceding anecdote will allow you to make an informed decision.",

People here only care about making useless internal tools and presentations so they can survive performance management because you’ll get PIPPed if your manager doesn’t think you have enough “influence”.God help you if your tech lead or manager is bad and comes from a certain demographic (good chance they will be). They will constantly micromanage, ass kiss to their higher ups, and never say no to work which just adds more to your plate. Obviously this is anecdotal but I’ve heard this sentiment from many other friends here as well. Some teams can be very chill but it’s such a dice roll and the bad teams are very bad, the good teams = just average at other companies. Also if the offer is for the Plano location, no amount of $$ will be worth it. FS located in Plano is notorious for high attrition, terrible WLB and PIPing those that don’t fit a certain demographicWe hired so many clueless and failed Amazon execs and they brought their shitty culture here",

Everyone lies on the applications and everyone uses AI to do everything for them and they can't answer basic interview questions. I work with some people who couldn't solve an easy leetcode problem. It's saturated with \"react developers\" who are useless outside of next.js with tailwind but it is massively lacking people who can plan out, scale, and build production-ready systems. It's lacking people who can do DevOps if they don't have Vercel, or people who can roll up an auth system without Firebase or Clerk. So we got 700 applications for a mid level web app developer and only maybe 20 are even qualified. Of those 20, 10 of them show up late for the interview or refuse to turn their camera on, of the remaining 10, they want more money than we can offer because they are more senior level and they know other companies will pay more than we can. So we are really struggling to find someone who hasn't had their brain rotted by Theo Browne and the Vercel ecosystem.

Everyone wants a less crowded path, but it’s rough everywhere. You can try really out-there fields, but you’ll likely still be competing with people who have specialized backgrounds or internships.Best bet is just to keep networking, work on projects, and be persistent.

That was the whole point of the layoffs. If all these big tech companies lay off employees at the same time, the hiring pool is suddenly filled with lots of talented employees. All of these employees need jobs and are competing with each other. In order to get employed again, some of these employees will take big pay cuts. So the companies are able to hire new staff at the same or similar level of talent for a reduced cost.That obviously won't work forever. And once the economy improves some of these employees will jump ship. But it's what these companies have decided to do in the short term.",

I have no idea how much they actually explain what you're asking about but they are both things I see in industry.First, adding people doesn't always make a team more productive. There's an old joke that a bad manager can't figure out why his pregnant wife can't deliver the baby sooner by hiring more women to help. Software development is like that sometimes - a project that takes 5 people a year usually still takes 10 people a year.Second, saving $20k on a hire doesn't automatically put $20k at the bottom line. If I know I want 5 engineers and I want them to do X, Y, and Z, then I don't care how cheap the ones are that can only do X or Y. I'll pony up the $80k for the one that can do X, Y, and Z since that's what the market values them at, even if the ones that only do X or Y only cost $40k.",

It’s a slow process because if they don’t pay good employees enough they jump ship to a competing company which is why today in a lot of white collar roles in the US it’s common to work 24 months at a company then switch. Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. In Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go. Within the next 20 years it wouldn’t surprise me if in the US pay is closer to what Europeans are making but without the benefits.",

But, it is a dying industry so all bets are off the table with AI incoming, or at least the theories they have been sold about AI.Short answer though is they need those managers to maintain their fiefdoms internally.

The response rate, even for rejections, rounds to zero. I have my very first real interview since graduation next week, and I got it by reference from someone at the company.Applying online is sending your resume into the ATS abyss, that is to say, far from the eyes of any real-life human who can make a hiring decision. The lack of responses and offers might be a personal deficiency, it's always possible, but current hiring practices have made job seeking an abysmal, soul-sucking nightmare. We are fumbling around in the dark through a winding graveyard of ghostpostings, scams, and poor practices. Your success does not necessarily correlate with your merit. That's just the way it is. It's a game at the end of the day so you gotta play by its crooked rules or get left in the dust. We chose the wrong time to join this industry OP. Tough luck.",

Microsoft is firing software engineers in the US and then hiring them in India, also raising the bar for engineers in the US making it harder to get and keep jobs. This is due to the fact many unemployed engineers on the market from Google, Meta and other good companies, so it makes sense for the company to fire some of its bad performing, too expensive or old engineers, and hire fresh talents from Meta. It's dog eats dog world, and it is probably going to be worse since OPEX is predicted to get less funding compared to CAPEX by the end of this decade.AI is still mostly overhyped, but it might become a problem in few years.

A mediocre performance on a very supportive team will likely be better than a stellar performance on a highly dysfunctional team. I think you should as a minimum try to find: * A manager who's been with a team for multiple halves* At least one IC6+ who works around you (if not associated with your work), also multiple halves on the team* Ideally, clear scope and some sort of vision for the team. There's a lot of subjective opinions, but I think these are generally agreeable things that are worth prioritizing. It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. More subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through). As an aside - I think performance will be much more about stakeholders talking about how great you are / other people in PSC, and objective metrics are somewhat secondary, esp for E3->E4.",

At meta the requirements are pretty clearly laid out but its really up to your team. They might not want to/cant give you opportunities to check off those requirements.Impact is also important. Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”. Its not always “i have to work on the newest feature”(although ig is alway making then removing features lol), it could be related to fixing something for On-Call, etc. You just need to optimize some part of the job to “make life easier”.The only thing you need is to adapt and meet these requirement, but the hard part is if your team is going to even let you/give you the opportunity. After 6-8months I would bring it up with your manager that you would like to start the process for promotion and just try for it.",

I admit I’m in a decent position due to a well-known but not FAANG company on my resume (as a previous role, not current role), name brand school, and yoe. I dropped to about 50 jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards, heard back from 8+ decent companies (like companies you might recognize, not just no name startups). Hit rate is much better for recruiters who reached out to me via LinkedIn or email. I honestly had to stop responding back after the first week of showing “open to job opportunities” on LinkedIn because of the overwhelming amount of messages for various startup roles, mostly AI. Went through the process for about 20 companies so far, rejected by 15, with the rest still ongoing but probably not able to finish before the offer deadline.Behavioral questions and hiring manager rounds I think are a cakewalk, just prepare your stories ahead of time. Hardest part is grinding leetcode questions to shake the rust off implementing DFS, binary search, etc. Feels like school again. System Design is okay. Can be challenging sometimes, but I feel like it’s easier to fall back on work experience with this and supplement with some studying. As opposed to coding questions which doesn’t have as much overlap with real work, and it feels like you just need to study solutions to a lot of different questions and practice.I don’t doubt that the market is grim out there for new grads or early in career folks, and certainly worse than a few years ago for senior folks. But at least from my limited pov, it’s still okay. When I get rejected, it’s still mostly because I fucked up a coding question. And there's definitely no shortage of AI startups trying to hire senior engineers.",

        "body": "Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. My advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! Assuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: As another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now. I'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example \"Docker\", \"React\" and \"Java\"). Here's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS. Maybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. I'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.I'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under \"additional experience\" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. For a template that has additional work experience I think the \"additional expereince\" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access). [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\\_wfma\\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)You might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. Anyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume. If you do change it up, you'll have to let me know if it made a difference.",

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.The undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more \"deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law\", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot? Or so the rationale goes.One could argue that labor market assessment ought to be done upfront, and it actually is in some countries, notably the LMIA in Canada, but as Canadians might attest, that's not necessarily successful in practice either.Personally I'm pretty cynical about political reform in general. \"Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\", as Kennedy famously said, if nothing else because the political machine doesn't really have your personal interest at heart in the first place.",

But student (F-1) visas are pure nonimmigrant (i.e. no dual intent), so if you say in your student visa interview that you plan to apply for this H-1b pathway that Congress created specifically for people like you, you could get your visa denied under INA 214(b) since they suspect you of immigrant intent.Immigration law is really complicated and no one who can vote has to deal with it directly, so I think Congress has little incentive to make laws that even make any sense at all.",

Somehow I settled on law and began planning a career move.But very quickly I realised it was the wrong choice. The law students I met seemed highly competitive and political, much more than any programmer I'd ever met, and there was a vague desperation to them. I read frank accounts of how numbing the work was and the crises of many lawyers who hit 40 and realise they're wasting their lives.I didn't leave technology in the end, I embraced it. I was looking for a career to fill holes in my self-image and try to counter my gnawing self-hatred. No job will do that. And I began to appreciate how creative I could be as a programmer once I accepted that I will never be perfect at it.Over the years I've become very thankful for this choice. Programming is what gets me up in the morning, there is nothing else like it for me. I will always be learning and it will never get boring.",

        "body": "One very important thing to keep in mind is that the markets from 2010-2022 were not all the same. We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.That said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the sameFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.AI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different. A company that laid off a bunch of employees because of AI-hype might be desperate to hire a ton more employees a year from now to fix all the shit that the vibe coders did.",

Things are just so different now. AI is an excuse for layoffs, not the root cause. A moderately skilled engineer still does a better job than AI tools. Often because you have to know what is actually a good solution and how to prompt your way to it. It’s easy to see it do tricks and get excited, but it’s not replacing real experience for a while. Many big businesses are messy, hesitant for countless reasons, or existing code just too complicated for it to work right now. Can’t say that will be true forever. The economy, at least in the US, depends on consumers consuming and a top fraction exploiting everyone else’s labor. Billionaires are living proof that there is no end - there is seemingly not limit so the cycle continues. Probably until enough people have nothing to lose and revolt.

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like \"you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed\".The other thing I don't like about leetcode questions being used for assessments is that we can't use debugging tools. I use my IDE to debug my code, to understand where my logic is wrong, to better understand my thought process and to fix them accordingly. This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up. Sometimes print statements are not helpful because you don't know where you are going wrong and it's not effective/efficient. It all takes time.It's like they are looking for robots/AI who can process everything in seconds and write up a solution in minutes. It's like they are not looking for humans.To solve these questions, you need to have tons and tons of of leetcode practice. It's why I tell everyone to start DSAs asap, and to start leetcoding asap.

You will never see well worded tasks. Even experts of the environment will have difficulty explaining themselves. So don’t be so surprised to see the same thing at interviewsThe only thing I would raise an eyebrow on this is, this might be too much for a new grad. There are times I asked questions very similar to this to new grads , but I always adjusted my expectations and was prepared to help all along the way if necessary. If that’s what happened, there is nothing peculiar with this. But if you are simply given this and the interviewer did nothing to work with you and watched you fail, then imo it’s a bit excessive.",

You go into the interview and the candidate knows nothing. Somebody else is directing him from off screen (or he’s just piping the audio into ChatGPT and reading back what it tells him to). If he gets hired, that off-screen person will do his work for the first couple weeks then taper off and the guy just calls in to daily standup with excuses for why he’s blocked again, and continues for as long as it’ll last before he gets fired (which takes surprisingly long at a lot of companies). It’s a nightmare from the hiring side. You learn to spot the patterns in the resumes over time, and once the zoom call starts it’s usually pretty clear who is a phony; but filtering through all the garbage and finding the real humans is hard. I know I must have filtered out a ton of legitimate candidates and I feel terrible for them, but there’s just not time to actually interview all of those resumes, so you do the best you can.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

Especially if you are close to a place like SF, where there are tons of them rotating in and out, and you dont have to pay for airfare or hotel.During Covid, I actually did a full 6 month certificate course in AI/ML.There's always something new you can learn, even if its just watching a dev focused YouTube channel. LeadDev is one that I follow which has Ted Talk style lectures on various topics, mostly pulled from their annual conferences.In an interview though, I wouldn't say that its impossible to keep current. The questioner knows that already, and it just comes off as being uncaring rather than realistic. And if you are using blogs or channels, it might help to provide a concrete example or background explanation since most people will be unfamiliar with that specific blog/channel, and they dont have quite the same implicit understanding as attending a conference or taking a class.",

I'd say there was some luck involved but mostly just attending meetups can increase your odds of running into the right person. If you go this route my advice is to not go into a meetup with the intention of finding a job. Obviously that is the main objective but just go to the meetup with the intention of building your network and talking to others in the field. Also have the Linkedin app on your phone so you can easily connect with others at the meetup.",

As a senior I’ve had to compose specifications starting with two sentences in a contract and compile information spread out across dozens of documents and people, and go through multiple rounds of feedback and corrections with the client.It’s incredibly jarring to then join stand up and have a junior complain that they’re blocked and spent the day doing nothing because their ticket doesn’t have 100% of the information needed to finish it, and they didn’t bother to even ask or try and find it themselves. It’s not just juniors that do this but they’ve tended to be the worst offenders and it’s a fast track to losing respect at any level",

When I first started, I was told \"Go build an integration between our product and X CRM\" and that was about as much interaction as I got.Same thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.My advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.When I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.Nobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.I adopted the mantra \"Not my circus, not my monkeys\" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.Put forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.I could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",

You just \"yes and\" everything. Examples: - \"Sure, I can definitely do that. It will take N days instead of the 2 you've suggested, though, because .\" - \"Yes, I can prioritize this, but I'll have to put aside the other tickets on Foo and Bar, which will delay those by 42 days.\" - And so on. You get the idea.> Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way).This is pretty common in major cities for serious tech jobs. Lots of people start with this and then work their way up to a better situation.My roughest commute back in the day was a drive to the train station (which had to be ass-early to get there in time to get parking), a train ride, and then a 1 mile walk from the train to the office. Then, in the evening, I'd do the whole thing in reverse. I dealt with it 5 days a week for a year, then got a better job. C'est la vie.I recommend a nice pair of noise-canceling headphones and a playlist of your favorite podcasts. It's temporary, and you'll have a better job with a better commute sooner or later, but in the meantime there's no need to suffer unnecessarily. Use the time to decompress or study, and be glad the noise-canceling headphones are way better these days than 10 years ago.",

My last name ends with the letters IN, so years ago I got a vanity domain name and email formatted like `bilbo@bagg.in` (not my real name but you get the gist) to try and be clever. Evidently some ATS systems go way out on a limb to assume that `.in` TLD means I must actually be in India. So if you're doing anything similar, be careful. Just use a gmail address.For the job I noticed that with, I was super interested so reached out to the recruiter directly on LinkedIn, and after some back and forth she set me up with a zoom interview with a VP who clearly thought I was part of one of those \"proxy interview\" scams where one person interviews and then a totally different person shows up for the remote job, and didn't want to be there from the beginning. I get it, I've been an interviewer with some of those. This is a very paranoid environment. I got enough other information from the interview to decide it wasn't a good fit even without that misunderstanding though, so bullet dodged all around.",

A BS in computer science is preparing you to be able to understand on a deeper level the why and how of things, rather than just the practical application of a given framework. A BS in CS can prepare you to be a software developer, but it can also prepare you masters or PhD courses, to be a researcher, or any other number of things beyond being a front end web developer. There is a heavy expectation on software developers to be learning while off the clock, and this expectation starts early while you’re still in school.That said, your courses could also be bad, it’s hard to say from what you posted.",

You get an internship you have to be a currently-enrolled college student, and I'm not aware of any companies that significantly increased the number of interns they hired each summer. On the flip side, even companies that had layoffs continued to hire interns each summer at a similar rate.My observation wasn't that tech companies changed their interviewing practices, they just hired more. They'd interview as many people as they could and hire everyone who passed, rather than the usual case of some \"passing\" the interviews but still not getting selected over even stronger candidates.Overall tech companies are still growing and hiring.I'm seeing a trend to hire more in LCOL areas and countries - not outsourcing, but actually opening offices in other cities and countries.Another issue is that the number of CS grads has doubled in the last 10 years and is still rising. It's quite possible that the number of CS grads is going up faster than demand, so the issue isn't that hiring is down (in historic numbers), but rather that demand has grown faster than supply.",

I also worked on personal projects (simple android apps) throughout my school years that I included on my resume.

Very few got into fang (5/100 students probably) and most of us got jobs at local relatively no name companies.I think my experience shows the importance of the networking opportunities you can find in school plus the importance of personal projects and I believe this still stands today.

I technically work a “data” job but most of what I do is building internal tools and dashboards for business analysts and data analysts. I’m one of a few here at my company that have a CS background and I became a lead within about 6 months after being hired as a “Senior Developer”. I’m paid well because I’m the one who tests if new software or applications will help the team improve in some capacity. It’s generally easier to get a job doing something technical at a company for a couple years and then pivot over to software engineer in the same company than it would be to get hired directly as a software engineer. In some cases you even get to skip the whole ten interview plus projects pipeline a bunch of companies are trying to do now.",

If you want more money you could become nurse practitioner. You are already seeing how fucked the tech job market is right now from your own experience.

A good chunk, possibly the majority, of your time will be making tweaks to boring old legacy apps built years ago. Regardless, as you’re already finding out, the market is bad right now and goin forwards may never again see the glory days leading up to 2022. You haven’t mentioned your age but if I could go back I’d pick healthcare for the stability and predictability, something you come to appreciate more as you get a bit older and start looking ahead to settling down. Also, cynical as it sounds it’s a bit naive to expect fulfillment and passion from / towards your day job. That’s something a fortunate few get to enjoy over the long term at least. If your job pays well, your coworkers aren’t assholes and your benefits + work-life balance are decent, and you’ve got stability - consider yourself lucky. I’d say stick with the RN role.",

        "body": "Here's some actually helpful advice:1. Make maintaining good work/life balance an explicit goal. If you budget your time like you have 60 hours a week, you will be working 60 hours a week. Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (\"what is X?\", \"how do I do Y?\"), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie. Work 45 hours a week and tell people you're working 60.",

You may have these loaded up for you by a project manager/agile coordinator or may have to pull them yourself, position dependent.If you are hourly you will likely need to enter hours worked into a time-tracking system assigned to the correct client code. You may also have to do something similar in a salaried position, but it's usually mostly for PTO tracking purposes unless you are doing agency/consulting work for multiple clients or business verticals.Most places in the US are expecting at least 40 hours of time a week. Most aren't sticklers about it, but some places (especially micromanage-y or \"productivity focused\") can get really in the weeds about how you're spending your time \"on the clock\", even if you're salary.Expect to have \"core hours\" for your day when you're reachable. These are generally around 10am-4pm local time, but you're often expected to work at least 9am-5pm/6pm daily.

I've noticed that you really have to make an effort to get to know your co-workers because water cooler talk is non-existent. You want to get to know your co-workers because you want to be able to work with senior/principal engineers. The jrs who have a good upper level engineer on their side are usually the ones who succeed. It's hard to create the connection online because everybody is so busy and if they arent they arent trying to have DM chats with their co-workers. Also you never have that transition so it is very easy to work 10+ hours without realizing it. Becuase yo uarent sure if others have left or not and sometimes doing an extra 30 minutes because you can and are waiting for something to finish building is easy to do with your laptop in the other room. Again all this is job and team dependent. I will let you know that one thing that is never really said when you are in college is that many of these jobs are not really 9-5. Salary means you work to get the job done wheher it took you 20 hours or 60. Sometimes it's even a game you have to do. Because if you did a task in 20 and tell your boss, he might just give you two bigger tasks right away.",

The tech stack, the team, what your role will consist of, what the expecations of you will be, what an average day of a SWE looks like, what kinds of major projects are coming in the future, etc should *not be a surprise*. These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.Next time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview. Otherwise you're literally just rolling the dice that you'll end up at another place that you thought would be doing X, but is actualy doing Y. You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.That being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.Also, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.Anecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.All that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that. My confidence, warranted or not, is what gets me my jobs offers.",

Be comfortable with saying \"okay, I don't know how that works properly... for now\". For now, just take a deep breath, every senior you respect has been where you are today. Here are some tips to make your life easier:1. Keep your world small. The route you already did with your mentor is the GOLD right now. You have 2 possible small ways you can expand your world. A) implement the rest of the routes for the project that you are working on right now, B) implement the same route across other projects. - It is probably easier to implement the other routes. 2. When working on this type of thing, you will be slow initially, it might take you 2 weeks to get through 2 routes initially, but by the last week of the summer you might complete a route per day. In order to move quickly, you are going to have to move slowly and intentionally. Things like Gradle / DI / those other internal tools and random config files on first blush don't sound super relevant to the task at hand, only learn how to use it if it is going to progress your goal. If you are going to *not* learn it on purpose, write it down and square it away for later. 3. Ask for feedback often, your mentor may be able to tell you what route would be the next simplest to tackle. 4. Don't be afraid to look at pull requests where any specific route was implemented. Often times, complete feature pull requests give you a really good idea of just how \"Small\" your world can be when you want it to, if you find some good ones. 5. If you are stuck on a particular thing for more than an hour, ask - just ask, ask your mentor or something else, \"Hey , do you have 5 minutes to explain something to me? I am trying to understand why when I remove the mock here this other test unexpectedly breaks - I Think you mentioned this during our call , but I think I just need a quick refresher - would super appreciate it!\" Just take it a day at a time, recognise that feeling like you don't know stuff is normal, panicking will not help you and it will detract from your ability to learn. You are also wrong about one thing, the ability to \"remember\" context is not key for success at larger companies, the actual key is realising what context does and does not matter. No one on your team knows everything, they're just capable of figuring out what bits are important enough to learn *today* to progress them towards whatever goal they're working on. Late July is a also a fairly reasonable goal for the task you were given, without knowing the specifics of the codebase. You'll be fine, just keep your head down, stick to it, and remember, keep your world small!",

Got a CS version of a minimum wage job (some IT help related role - my standards got worse as my desperation grew) to stop that 90 day clock and finally got my first interview after months of graduation - SDE at rainforest. *Had* to nail it and I did, which is a testament to how broken the market truly is because 90% of the jobs I'd applied to by that point were significantly less demanding. I did a couple of interviews after that funny enough, but one phone screen with each of them when I made it clear I was an international student made them lose all interest. I know this sub has a lot of hate towards internationals which is disheartening so I'm taking a chance with this comment - but in some ways we're much more impacted by this market than you are; most of the people I know are very capable and it'll take years to repay any loans if they are sent back. Everything in the US is run like a business, even education. A lot of universities have fairs in our countries selling us dreams of an elite American education and how we get to work for 3 years to pack back tuition, only for us to come here and realize nobody wants to give us a fair shot purely because hiring domestic workers is much easier (as it should be).",

How are they staying within the country?Some of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?Yes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).Again, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",

A single 6 month stint is pretty easily explained away as something you gave a solid shot (you didn't leave after a month or anything), and it just ended up being a bad fit.The alternative is having a 6 month career gap. So pick your poison, a 6 month stint, or a 6 month career gap. Both *could* cause you issues, but I think the former is less likely you cause issues.You can also A/B test both options so you can see how the market reacts first hand. I've done this before to help gauge if certain things on my resume were hurting me more than helping me.",

Use whatever you can 'on the job' because it sounds much better, looks better and I'm no expert at lying.* **Learn Postgres for databases**. Easy to install and use. Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing. I haven't used Tomcat on the job in 10 years. Cloud crap is taking over but local servers is a nice plus and they don't use cloud data. Bonus: Mock a database with JUnit + Mockito or PowerMock or whatever. You should know JUnit.",

The fundamentals you've mastered translate directly to modern architectures - Spring Boot naturally leads to microservices, your database knowledge applies whether it's SQL or NoSQL, and the core programming concepts remain the same. The issue isn't that you lack skills, it's that you're not effectively communicating how your existing experience relates to what they're asking for, and you're being too honest about what you haven't done instead of focusing on your ability to learn and adapt.Stop saying \"I haven't worked with that\" in interviews and start saying \"I haven't used that specific technology in production, but here's how I'd approach it based on my experience with similar concepts.\" Your Spring Boot background gives you microservices understanding, your Java skills mean you can pick up any backend technology quickly, and your database experience shows you understand data persistence regardless of the specific system. Build a few small projects using React, deploy something simple to AWS, and set up a basic Kubernetes cluster locally - you don't need years of experience, just enough to speak intelligently about the concepts and show you can learn.I'm on the team that built [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed specifically for situations like this where you need to navigate tricky questions about skills gaps and position your experience in the best light during interviews.",

The best you’d probably get is some sort of analyst role at a company, as they’d probably be interested in a person trained in economics. But in 2025, that probably won’t lead to a pathway into a more technical role, since most data science and ML roles are looking for either loads of experience or advanced education. So yeah, I think an advanced degree would 100% be beneficial to your candidacy at companies. In person and hybrid more so than online, since you’ll be able to network better. What’s the offer from the school, how expensive are we talking? Because there’s lots of price points in 2025 to get educated at. I’m cash flowing a medium priced school right now, myself.",

Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.Not having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.When changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",

So, maybe the best applicant went to a regional campus, and you'd miss them by only looking at kids who went to the state's flagship school; but on average, the kids that went to the flagship school will probably be good enough, and just like that 1,000 resumes became 100 resumes.Note that I am *not* saying this is ideal, equitable, etc. But unless or until the market turns around, it seems inevitable.",

Access to the latter category of jobs will increasingly be gated on pedigree: where you went to school, who you interned with, where you previously worked. Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). This is already how it works in other fields like law and finance. In finance there is retail finance and high finance. In law there’s big law raking in big bonuses and local firms that aren’t. In both cases it’s nearly impossible to jump from the low track to the high track. There’s no meaningful path for the guy making loans at the local credit union to get to blackstone PE.",

In person interviews might make a comeback. This has been said but they companies might start trending toward getting people on site for technicals.Move away from leetcode to open-ended technical questions. I have had just as many of these as leetcode style interviews, or at least some marriage of the two.Pair programming. This is still probably one of the common ways to do a technical. My current job was gained through a pair programming exercise. Here you can put in a leetcode style puzzle that might be harder to see coming and cheat through. Yes, I think it will trend away from purely online leetcode questions and LLMs are disruptive but they don’t necessarily spell the end of leetcode style interviews.",

I have interviewed for national laboratories before, and if you're capable of getting a high level security clearance - they actually really value MS degrees.

When I got my new job they were offering me a good bump from my last job (about a 30% raise). When I told my GF (we live together) she looks at me and says \"OMG we will be able to buy so much for our house\".I dont want her to sound like she is money craved, it's more like she is a spend-mentality where i am save mentality. My mindset is I will live the same regardless of how much money I make (to a certain degree) and just save the rest and hoepfully retire younger. When I heard about the 30% raise my first thought was \"ok I can set about 10% of that to pay off some stuff from when I was unemployed, then when that's down invest that 10%, maybe with another 10% i will put in my savings/invest funds and then the last 10% will be for anything for us\". When she said that I was taken a bcak. My GF is someone who will pay and buy for her own things so I have never felt like she has cared about it. She'll buy me clothes even when I dont ask for it. She makes good money too. She has good money saved but when it comes for future money she hasnt really prepared well for it. She is definetely more of a spender than a buyer. To your point about people not wanting to go down. I gave her some tips to help her save more and told her to put maybe a couple hundred bucks per paycheck. She did it and for over a month she was crying about how little her paycheck was now looking. Again this is a girl who makes 6 figures. I think she is around 105k and in a no-income state her take home is probably around 70k.",

(5.6% vs 2.9%) That's nearly double, so it is worse.All that said, it's going to be very hard to determine which graduates without a job would have otherwise gotten one at a different time. This has always been a competitive field with people complaining they can't break in, but the situation is statistically worse today than a few years ago.best of luck!",

But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me \"Everything's gotta get done\", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.When unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. \"X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over\".It's all about how you respond. Obviously having completely clean sprints would be great, but that's rarely how things go. When things come up, tickets carry over. It's pretty normal.",

This varied by team, but sometimes someone would act as a point person for the sprint from other teams. I don't recall if this was the same person every sprint, or if two different people played the roles.Perhaps your manager would be open to tracking the additional work that way. It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. There could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. Sounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. Another huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team. What happens if you're on vacation, or you're not longer on the team? This helps protect against that. It will also hopefully expand peoples' skillsets. It will help everyone and the team as a whole.",

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.But if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total? That probably is worth getting a PhD.Now, [as some have commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3ueaa/comment/mw3rrha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you get your PhD in something ultra-specific, you might actually be limiting your career growth and potential. *But you don't have to*.A lot of people do their PhD in a relatively broad area of CS, or an area of CS that has applications acrosss industries and areas, and in that world you don't get the same negative impact of specialization.So to me, that is important - if you go to do a PhD with a focus on going back to a corporate/industry job instead of staying in academia, then make sure you shape your PhD (research, publications, etc.) to match that. Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",

If you're truly interested in philosophy, you shouldn't wait for permission or a degree to encourage you to dive in. The same applies to ML; however, having a degree in this area will be more beneficial practically than a philosophy degree.Personally, I would also like to pursue a master's degree in philosophy, but I see it as something I will do when I retire or if I choose to follow a management or leadership path.All be best.

The fact that interviewers kept pushing about certifications despite your detailed technical explanations shows they're following a checklist rather than assessing your actual capabilities.Getting multiple certifications in a short timeframe isn't a red flag when you already have the underlying experience - it just shows you're adapting to market demands. The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.I'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",

No interviews.I'm pulling out of the process because it is definitely a scam. Offer without an interview based on answers that anyone can google in 2 seconds !? NO!",

        "body": "It’s going to be so case by case that it’s hard to answer definitively. I am currently at a ~2,000 person company that is slow, has too much process, and imbalanced staffing for their goals. We plan way too much (in halfs,) don’t stick to it, then thrash. Very compartmentalized as if whole sections of the company are external vendors. The best thing they have going for them is a supposed blameless culture, but this often manifests as a lack of ownership/responsibility for actions. In the past I was at a company that grew from 50 to over 1,000 and they were basically the opposite. Fast, not much process, pragmatic staffing. We planned more flexibly, often week by week, and later monthly as we grew. Culture was very open and encouraged cross functional behavior and leadership. The only thing I didn’t like here (besides stress that built over years) was the subtle blame games that happened behind your back. So like I said, complete opposites. Both are political but often this behavior came from career big tech people. Try as we might to start fresh, people bring their baggage and it impacts the culture throughout the industry, for better and for worse.",

I would say the more critical and lower on the company hierarchy you are, the less agency you have in controlling or influencing or protecting yourself from organizational churn and pushback or squabbling among your leaders. I’ve joined such companies twice, once as an intern converted to new grad, then as a mid-level engineer and both times, I spent a great deal more time than I would have liked dealing with organizational problems and people issues.",
