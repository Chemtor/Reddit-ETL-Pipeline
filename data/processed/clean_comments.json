I said to my boss \"we're not going to seriously drop everything and do this, right?\", and he said \"sorry, we're going to drop everything and do this\". Damn it. Anyway, fast forward to September 7, team has put in 14-hour days to build out everything, and I'm thinking \"that absolutely sucked, but at least there will be some good juicy sales in those reports\". Open the reports/dashboards the next day, and it was basically DOA. So I go to the digital marketing manager guy doing the project and said \"hey man, there's like nothing happening here wtf?\" And he said \"Oh sorry the marketing launch got pushed by two weeks, but we forgot to tell you\". Product was also later pretty much a total flop, and the whole thing was an annoying waste of time. Yay.",

Either you want technological abundance that FOSS advocates for or you want the big bucks, but you don't want both at the same time.

The thing was, tho, the customers put huge weight on the reports and creating them was very complex. In essence the company had 1 person designing, building, QAing, and operating a 3rd complete user experience with exec-level attention and revenue risk. If it had been a webapp it would never have become a 1-person sidebar, but because Tableau was involved, it was. And as I'm thinking about it, something similar was actually the case at another much larger and better known company I was at a few years before.

Another useful one to review is whether anyone is logging in to check the dashboard during the weekend and holidays. The harsh reality is that people tend to only look at these things from 8am to 10am and that's it done. There are always realtime use cases for sure but folk deciding to move from batch as a \"nice idea” likely don't have the need for true realtime else batch wouldn't have been in place for so long.Meet in the middle, run intra day (which already at least doubles their update speed just by running it mid day) but as you've mentioned this brings a whole load of other things with it.

It is understandable, probably should stick with your batch job. but if you ETL your data from datalake to another analytics datastore, it can be changed to be real time by implementing datalake's built-in feature such as AWS S3's SQS to detect S3 bucket changes.

Also it’s more expensive, requires more infrastructure, more optimization, more maintenance, more engineers, oncall rotations. So make sure leadership actually understands what they are actually asking for. In most cases you can make it work with a microbatch architecture, but if you don’t even have Kafka/debezium/an event-driven architecture that is also your data source, then it’s probably not worth it unless there’s a solid business case around it",

Pre-aggregated APIs and recent data (7–30 days) often cover 90% of use cases. That way, it will be affordable.If stakeholders flood you with requests, remember: those “quick asks” can become long term data headaches.

If the setup delivers value (aka if we shut it down how desperate are the people) it opens up more budget. As someone said here, saying no becomes essential. Or better ask why they need this data, what actions are they planning to derive from it. Ask them if the metric they ask for is dropping by 20% what are they planning to do.

These improves performance dramatically. There are relational databases that have option of storing data in columnar format. You still write sql normally and the performance is great. You can also consider data crunching platforms in the cloud from Azure Synapse, Databricks(Azure, AWS, GCP), BigQuery Snow Flake. Of course this transition is a major project, and there cloud computing costs and so forth.Using cloud-based computing makes it easy to scale up and scale down compute as needed.

You want some engine that can run this in parallel and implements some join strategy that can chunk the problem in smaller parts and resolve each part in parallel.Some approaches that do that are sort joins and hash joins. Sort joins would probably be too expensive at the data sizes you describe, but may work in some cases (e.g., if the data happens to be sorted, or at least partitioned by some relevant column).Hash joins might work well, though. Essentially, they send records from both tables to join to the same node in a cluster if they hash to the same value (or list of values) and each cluster would join a part of the data. Repeat that for each join, with a high enough degree of parallelism, and then aggregate at the end (maybe some aggregation along the way would be possible). Spark, Presto, several 4DBMS and other engines can do that kind of operation.Having said that, if your end result is just about 1000 rows, I'd investigate if there isn't some pre-aggregation that you can apply to some (or all) of the tables before starting the join. That'd significantly reduce the join effort.",

Doesn’t matter if you have a schema management system but the engineers only update it after they’ve broken the system. If this is your first job and you’re the only DE, it may be difficult to implement good process. But it’s a small company—not super unwieldy yet. So get in there and set higher expectations for everyone—if they want their data to be reliably available, they need to not break things in production without sufficient notice. If this situation persists, you will eventually get so caught up in fixing things on an ad hoc basis that you’ll never get anything new built. Your CTO is not wrong—you should ALSO build tests to reject the bad data input when it fails and alert you to the new state. Ideally a failed test rolls back the data back to a prior stable state. Bad data shouldn’t break the downstream system, it should be rejected. The feasibility of that will depend on your specific system.Edit; also…what is the development process like? Are there separate dev/test/prod environments where you can get pulled in earlier via PR’s?Breaking changes shouldn’t get that far without anyone being notified.",

FYI - the upstream engineers don’t know if they will break you or not. So from their point of view they are honestly confused.

        "body": "I did this at my last job, reluctantly. I was forced to do it as part of an initiative to surface metrics and data transformations back to end-users, and one of the engineers refused to use production data to test the dashboards; it HAD to be a fully separate env, hooked up exactly to the app's staging env. The rest of the company already had a full pipeline but tied to prod.I thought it was a waste of time and money when I was forced to do it because the environment was fully read-only. And after I finally completed the project I thought the same thing. The only good purpose of the separate envs was that it made it a little easier to test security, but it wasn't like that was particularly difficult. It would have been probably just as much work to set up a way to mock production data in localhost, and overall way more useful for the company.So, we got it working ultimately (separate Airflow deployments and separate Snowflake accounts), but it was a pain in the ass. I had a somewhat informal way of managing Snowflake account level changes as migrations / IaC, and setting it up perfectly still took a while. (This also corresponded with a company wide push to formalize migrations of all db's into a new software.) Then the Airflow instance, oh boy. You don't realize just how many assumptions you make about envs until you have to formalize the ability to make an arbitrary multiple number of them. I thought I knew, but I didn't. Oh, also, your staging and prod data will be different in painful ways. Like imagine a JSON field stored as a varchar, but the staging env has some bullshit that's not a JSON. Yep, that's one of many things that happens when you try to run your prod data pipelines on the app's staging environment.Overall, not worth it. The setup I had originally is very simple: there's local and there's prod on a single Snowflake account. When you run commands locally, you hit a separate database for writes and transforms that are handled by the env vars. All reads are exactly from the prod data. All developers have full permissions in the local or dev or whatever you want to call them environments. There were also simple utils to help clone prod into dev for easy development.Moving to the multi env setup was not only months of my life neither me nor the company is getting back, but due to how MWAA works, it significantly increased the costs of the data platform.Shortly after I left, the engineer who wanted this colossal waste of time and money also left. Or maybe he was forced out. Cool.Honestly, at the point you're doing this sort of thing to support multi tenancy across genuine staging/prod envs, my advice is to scrap Airflow and Snowflake entirely. Go to something like Clickhouse and use materialized views to manage your pipelines so it's orchestration free.I also want to note another thing. Not a single internal data end user cared about this. This came from a single frontend app developer and was supported by upper mgmt because it sounds good on paper if you're a conventional SWE. Even though it's completely divorced from how internal data consumers use and contribute to data pipelines. What data scientists do is they train models and do analysis on prod data. They don't care about the developers' staging data because it doesn't represent or cover real usage. As you note in your post, this seems to be what they want to do, right? Except now you're finessing with data shares instead of just some simple IAM and permissions.Lastly, the place I left to, I setup their entire data infrastructure. I'm still on exactly \"local\" and \"prod\" in one Snowflake account, and I have no desire to ever change this. Actually, we do have a \"staging\" env for testing full CRUD being run against our OLAP db in the app's actual staging env. What it is, is: a clone of the prod db, cloned weekly, so that state is preserved within testing sessions but it also up to date with prod. Also, we do have a way to mock user sessions in our app's staging env. That works well enough! I will literally write javascript dashboards myself, or migrate to an entirely separate DB and delete our Airflow pipelines and switch to materialized views, before I spin up multiple envs to assist someone who won't put up with a minor inconvenience for them at the expense of multiple months of my own time.",

Astronomer tries to make this better with its Astro CLI but it's still a sh\\*t compared to Dagster.I have used Airflow in production since \\~2017 but recently I had to evaluate Dagster and in my opinion it's lightyears ahead in most aspects, *particularly* local development. I would seriously consider it for future orchestration needs.In both cases - don't tie your logic to orchestration. Both systems will try to get you to implement your transforms within the system, but this just introduces a tight coupling. Implement your logic in something standalone that can be called by itself (eg package it into a Docker container that you can call with \\`docker run\\`) and then just orchestrate *that* from Airflow / Dagster. You can then test it entirely independently and only have to wire it up to the orchestrator when it comes times to call it as part of a pipeline",

        "body": "1. In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). Although partitioning is a tool you can also use to “group” and “label” your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.2. If you don’t need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)If you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)Note: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.3. Look at 1.For idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This “metadata” can carry the same information that you want to implement with the “processing time” partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have. Don’t sculpt your data to make your life easier when coding data pipelines, shape it to make it friendly for the consumers.",

On the build, do CDC from Postgres with Debezium into Kafka, land in S3/Delta, model with dbt, orchestrate in Airflow or Prefect, enforce tests with Great Expectations, track lineage with OpenLineage or Unity Catalog, and expose curated tables via simple APIs. I’ve run this with Snowflake and dbt plus Airflow, and used DreamFactory to spin up REST APIs from legacy SQL Server so ingestion and prototyping didn’t stall. Document medallion zones, data contracts, RBAC, CI/CD (Terraform + GitHub Actions), cost guardrails, and observability; add a small RAG demo on curated data to bridge your LLM work.

In larger orgs it's also a great way to enforce standardisation of calculations like KPIs: without a semantic layer Sue from finance might have a retention rate calculation different from Bob from HR's version, and when the C-suite see two different numbers for the \"same\" thing they either pick on based on whether Bob or Sue has the better reputation, or distrust them both entirely. If Bob and Sue are dragging and dropping a measure from the same model that doesn't happen. And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.Organisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) . So semantic models work really well for hub-and-spoke style organisation set ups.I haven't gotten into the AI side of things but when getting buy in for this work, pitching it as a step towards AI enablement is a great way of getting traction.",

It should be modeled against the entire company and will change about as fast as the company does (not very). The semantic layer is used for your data products. Data products mean anything that the end users need. One of the biggest challenges any data warehouse has is keeping the data between data products aligned. You always create your data products from the core layer for this very reason. As a general rule of thumb, your core layer doesn't specifically address any business need (actually it has to address all of them). You may be asking, why not just query the core? Data products are created to align with the business needs. What finance needs is not necessarily what sales needs. When you create something like a star schema, you are layering on business requirements, processes and definitions that may not be the same across the entire enterprise. Just that one data product. It is often very tempting to reuse a data product that has close but not entirely overlapping needs. Don't do it. That is a short cut to getting unreliable data products as it is hard to serve two masters.",

They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework. If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself. You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores. Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII. This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues. It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.Once you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.A good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments: development and QA/staging. The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis. The development environment should have finer-grained controls for overwrites, so as not to erase work-in-progress changes that developers have made to those datasets. Ideally, each team should have some control over whether their data domain is merely appended to by the automated ETL jobs, or overwritten/reset entirely.",

Compliance people hate it but can't offer a practical alternative that doesn't slow everything down. So everyone quietly works off prod and hopes audits don't dig too deep. Worst part is the vicious cycle. Because everyone works off prod anyway there's no incentive to build proper test data infrastructure.",

Inmon gives you more flexibility to add data products down the line and has a much better likelihood for them to be aligned with each other. All semantic data products should be created from the core layer and don't try any shortcuts. Shortcuts are a very good way for your users to lose trust in your DW.A word to the wise.

If you're mostly staging pre ingested data to a semantic layer, you can probably figure it out eventually. Dealing with highly abstracted classes and complex ingestion architecture is something that requires a decent bit of training. If you think you're being set up for failure with the DE role, the DA role may be safer. The big question is: which hiring manager do you like more? I'm guessing that if they are hiring an entry level DE as the only DE on the team, they are resource strapped and have no idea what is going on. Next question: is there an internal path to a data engineer or data science role at the DA team?",

For example if you are on AWS your Bronze data might land in some Glue Table once you trigger your pipeline that cleans up your data for the Silver Layer you can save the file as a csv to s3 and do a bulk load into Redshift and repeat for Gold. Your 3 environments Dev, QA/UAT and Prod should all be separate in a ideal use-case so you get no chance messing up your prod data when developing I have seen bad things happen when people have Prod and Dev database on the same environment forget to change 1 line in a SQL command and boom there goes your prod DB",

        "body": "My ideas on demos have changed over the years. Keep in mind that Agile and the demo they talk about was not designed for data engineering, so you need to adapt. Showing how a pipeline now runs 20% faster, or how you’ve improved data accuracy by 30% is dry as hell and demos terribly. What demos well is actual apps (or web apps) and clicking through them showing shiny features and pictures.In my latest project my team is creating a data pipeline and suite of reports for a new product. Our stakeholders are regulators, so we don’t get to talk to them. We have internal product people that interface with them. One thing we have done is create a crude diagram of each of the models we are building in the DAG. If it was created in the past sprint I color them one way so they stand out. I don’t go into depth on what they do, the point here is for upper management, product, and others to see “oh there’s more green boxes than 2 weeks ago”. Pictures demo better than words, and this shows progress. Obviously this works for greenfield work and wouldn’t work as well for other work.A challenge we have had is that we get different personas joining our demos. Sometimes they are upper management who think they are still technical and they want to get into details. Other times they are product people who are curious about how we interpreted a particular requirement. Other times it’s upstream teams asking things about a particular interaction. Honestly, any interaction is good interaction. However, I have been absolutely terrible at predicting which part of the demo will get the most traction. This is probably a function of how demos operate though. We roll with the punches and answer what we can.I usually have 1 or 2 people demo something we delivered. Usually it’s a particular table/model, but I push for something that is novel. People love novelty. If the report is “select everything from this table and aggregate” then it’s not a good candidate. We recently had a report that had the goal of showing the transaction record that crossed a certain cumulative sum threshold. That’s novel, and so that is what I pushed the team to demo. There ended up being a lot of conversation around that approach and the validity of the requirements. Good, we want conversation and interaction.I try to rotate different people demoing work they have done so everyone gets their time to shine. I make it clear that the goal is to a degree sales. Sell your work. Brag. Explain what you thought was interesting or challenging or whatever. People will engage with that.I also bring up specific challenges. This last sprint we spun out on a particularly ambiguous requirement. Attempting to nail down that requirement resulted in not delivering one of the items in the sprint goal. I made sure to relate those 2 things and called it out. It’s not just about painting a rose colored story, it’s also about showing we do more than just sling data left to right.Numbers also tend to register with people. An old manager of mine used to have a slide for git metrics. “this sprint we added 2311 lines of code and removed 5541”. It seemed a little corny to me at the time, but in reality it adds to the perception of “oh this team Got Stuff Done”On the topic of numbers, mentioning them can also make you sound like you know what you are doing. This can be more useful in non-greenfield areas. For example: “this table has 110 million records in it and grows at the rate of 5 million per month. Each daily run varies from 150k to 175k and runs for 20 minutes” if the goal of your project is to reduce cost then you tie it to that “…and with our new special sauce, we save $20k/yr”. If it is to run things faster you could say “and now we have partitioned it in a way that we have 10 parallel jobs that complete in 2 minutes”. Tie what you are doing to the goals of the sprint or project.Sorry if these ideas are a bit unorganized, hopefully these help you.",

        "body": "A lot depends on your tech stack but make it callable. In the example of Python/Airflow make it an importable variable. Finding yourself reusing the same default arguments put it in a variable and import across dags. If you find you need to change common elements in that variable put the definition in a function with parameters. Same thing with open telemetry or open lineage, define your structure for making the call and do it once. A big advantage of this is structure, everything looks the same data is captured in a uniform way and simplifies your life a ton. Depending on your size this can start as simple parameters but may evolve into some kind of log class that you pass as a parameter. Word of warning stay away from template files. I've worked with too many teams that start doing templates to try and enable non engineers to just drop in SQL or something and it makes life miserable. Speeds up initial work but it will cause a lot of headaches down the road with unmaintained, unoptimized code and leaves you with a swampy mess of data.Keep a good folder structure. Don't put your orchestration code in the same folder as your data quality code. Favor nested folders. That ELT folder you have probably has sub components maybe by source, domain, project or whatever else makes sense for your team and size. TLDR; Break things up, software design principles apply to data engineering as well. Follow good SOLID, DRY, AND KISS principles.",

Keep orchestration code separate from data-quality checks and business transforms; organize by domain/source under a shared “lib” folder. Use pydantic settings and env vars for per-env behavior instead of template files. Add pre-commit with ruff/mypy and a couple of golden-path tests so changes don’t break DAGs.With Airflow for orchestration and dbt for transforms, DreamFactory gave us ready APIs over Snowflake and Postgres metadata so dashboards and ops scripts could query lineage and DQ stats without custom services.Package the boring stuff once, version it, and keep every project thin.",

Here you can have unclassified data, and potentially have it unmasked. The only access to these areas is either the automated system, or users with elevated privileges who are accessing it for the specific purpose of classifying data and setting up automation for ingestion and transform to later layers.You should track the classification for each column to determine what kind of data it has. Is it personal data? Is it PII? Is it generic contact style PII (name, email, phone) or sensitive identity-theft-enabling PII like external identifiers or private information (license number, tax number, birth details, passport, etc). Those classifications help you to understand the security policy you place on the column.With a lakehouse you have the option to also separate the data in the storage layer. You can have separate buckets for pii or sensitive data, so that you can specifically track and audit access to the buckets, and a leak of any kind on the general data bucket does not leak sensitive data.You will need some kind of query portal that enforces column-level security for you. Something like SageMaker, for example. You will need to set up rules for automatically hiding/masking tables/columns that people cannot access. You need to make sure people don't have an alternative for accessing the data.There are tools you could point at your bronze data to scan for sensitive data. They won't be perfect but they're a good start. I believe AWS comprehend can do it, but there's a variety of 3rd party tools you can run.---The main point is your early areas are kept inaccessible to users, so that you can hold the data in an unclassified manner that allows you to do ingestion and classification work on it. Users can only access data through a system that enforces security and access controls on queries, and you only add data that has gone through that classificatio process.",

We can do better than that.Well if you do it without OS then it will still need 1 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM for $89/month.> The deeper we dug, the more we realized the real bottleneck wasn't the database software itself - it was the operating system underneath it. Every I/O call, every context switch, every kernel scheduling decision was silently taxing performance. That's what led us to the idea of a new foundation: a hardware manager purpose-built for data workloads.Would like to see the proof.> Operating systems were designed in a different era - when a \"computer\" was a desktop or a mainframe, not a hyperscale database server.What? At fist computers were almost only used for databases and not desktops. Also there are thousands of newly developed OS', old codes also got rewritten.> They evolved to run anything: browsers, games, spreadsheets, daemons, shells.

Until that is done, you can choose almost any database internals book and see mentions of how os is not your friend, etc.Or taken from [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3709714](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3709714) : \"Database systems often aim to tightly control hardware to optimize performance, as they typically have better insights into the workloads than the operating system. However, with the performance gap between CPUs and modern I/O devices narrowing, database systems are increasingly dissatisfied with the general-purpose interfaces provided by the OS\"(written by guys at MIT)>What? At fist computers were almost only used for databases and not desktops. Also there are thousands of newly developed OS', old codes also got rewritten.Well we didn't say what were computers used for, but what operating systems became in last 50 years.\\> Based on the description, QuinineHM is an OS - just not a general-purpose one, but who said only general-purpose OS can exists? Boots the hardware, Manages CPUs, timers, and devices etc. - these are exactly what we call operating system.Not really. OS provides many other things. Hardware Manager is just there to do things needed by hardware, set up interrupts, nic, apic, boot cores, etc. After that is done it gets out of the way and exposes full hardware to software it got compiled with. It cannot execute code it didn't get compiled with.Hope that answered some questions, feel free to ask more.",

The Airflow helm chart for kubernetes includes git-sync containers to automatically pull the change from your DAG repo.Also bonus, you may want to try Airflow's kubernetes executor.",

No way around it as it is the nature of the beast. I think you are dealing with a smaller amount of data (<1GB). JSON format is also slow. You are running into an old, solved problem. ETL can be expensive. It is one of the main reasons that file based looks so attractive (but is actually data on beer goggles).Let me share a way that has dealt with this issue. First, and most important, how are you using the data? This is the key question and will be the reason for your upstream choices. This should be used to guide all your choices. See which final format fits your SLA and performance needs best. See how I am moving to objective and not subjective reasons?The final form has to also consider flexibility, expandability and scalability. Have at least some good assumption on these so that you can use more information to make the case.BTW, ETL is just the homework you have to do in order to get the data into the final form. Until it is queried, data has no value. Zero. That seems obvious, but you would be amazed the number of people that don't understand this.Is your boss also the data architect? If he is, going against him may not be worth it. There are tradeoffs you will have to consider in your employment.You are at a point where it sounds like you are on the edge of a pissing match and you aren't prepared.

(Wouldn't be right for me to go into too much detail.) We worked with many of the leading Pharma. The goal was to help the companies collect regular data feeds and ELT them into a data warehouse, usually Snowflake or Redshift. We used our own PaaS orch platform based on K8s. the main observability tool then was New Relic -- an OTel adopter. (What we did when I was there was basic. DataKitchen now sell an observability tool of their own -- haven't used it but it looks cool). We used NR to monitor data file arrival, data loading job execution, and platform and/or K8s errors coming out of our airflow-like orch tool -- including sql errors. NR captured user who created the job, what the job was for, how much data the job moved, and did every step in the process complete in \\~expected time, history of the job over time. We also used NR for basic log aggregation and had alerts for specific conditions observed in log output. We didn't use traces. We wanted that for the steps in the jobs, but didn't have time to implement while I was there. The DevOps team used more sysOps sampling metrics to know how the pods were performing and the health of the underlying nodes and storage.Kind of similarly, I'm currently leading a project to build a data file feed ingestion tool called CsvPath Framework. We support Otel and OpenLineage for observability. the framework doesn't do any sysOps metrics. and it doesn't natively ship its own logs -- you would have to do that, same as for any system you're hosting. What it does is fire data processing events for arriving files registered, validation scripts loaded, runs started/ended, steps within runs started/ended, and validation errors. I.e. we're just focused on the data. CsvPath is kind of like [Soda.io](http://Soda.io) for databases, but totally focused on preboarding flat-file feeds with a lot more opinionatedness about how to do it right. if we didn't have Otel (and OpenLineage) we'd have to roll our own way of doing monitoring and alerting. that would not have been practical.Hope that helps. if it's not off-target happy to say more.",

I have been using it for a project this year and I'm super impressed with its feature set, Python API, command line tools, and web console. It is so amazingly fast performing scans on big datasets, too, and you get detailed information on every query about how much compute it used and how much data it scanned. Big plus in my opinion is that it is a SaaS offering so it relieves you from database admin burden (which I personally kind of detest doing, haha).If you have < 1 TB of data it could be a good solution. A full scan of 1 TB is $6.25, but you can avoid doing that very often with decent table optimizations like partitions and clustering or even duplicate tables with different optimizations, since the storage is cheap. I like it better than either Redshift or Databricks, though I don't have a ton of experience with either. I liked Databricks but I feel like you really have to commit their platform and ecosystem.I don't know if it fits your use case but in my opinion it is an amazing platform and easy to work with as a developer. And, plus, it is relatively easy to make it inter-operate with other Google services or at least there's a lot of info out there on best practices. The documentation is excellent as well. I don't know for sure but I imagine plugging it into Tableau is straightforward.If you have more specific questions please LMK here in the comments.",

We went with snowflake and dbt, with fivetran for SAP and python scripts elseware. 70k budget is probably tight since you’re using tableau, depending on licenses, but we’re able to keep our snowflake costs pretty reasonable and dbt cloud is very reasonable (for now, we’ll see what happens with the fivetran acquisition). There’s also next to zero maintenance in snowflake. We had to recreate all of our tableau dashboards, that was a bit of a headache. Snowflake may be worth looking at and we have never regretted moving away from the Alteryx setup.",

The problem is that each of the workloads tend to get in the way of the other. i have seen DW with very light OLTP or OLTP with very light analytics but not even workloads. It is the same reason you can sort of get a way with a federated RDMS in OLTP but not OLAP of any size. Also, most organizations don't do \"best in breed\" they use \"good enough of breed\" that barely meet the requirements due to cost. The top end RDMS systems are almost all proprietary. The only thing that open source has going for it is price. In almost every other feature they are playing catchup to what the proprietary systems had 10-15 years ago.",

In my case, I'm forcing it by passing a hint.And yes, I think the cross join isn't really an option.

I have never had a chance to use it, so I cannot advise on that, nor on its pricing. Self-managed Airflow is quite a headache to set up (and most likely you need extensive DevOps know-how); managed instance from AWS is rather expensive if you don't use it as bread and butter for your work (I think the entry cost is about $400, while this would cover all your monthly costs for Glue).Could you elaborate on your setup?

If you're okay with a short downtime then you could even just drop and recreate the Postgres table. You could probably just use CSV files so you maintain native support for the Postgres commands.The memory consideration on the server is, IMHO, a bit ridiculous for data this small; sounds like a problem you'd have in like 2004. Just do whatever you need; seriously doubt there will be issues with memory unless the server is really underpowered.BTW, an `updated_at` column in the source is exactly how this situation is typically handled so then you can store a \"high water mark\" (last update datetime handled) so you know which new records to import when your job re-runs. That's a major problem if that field is invalid. If you can talk to whoever is managing the mysql db, tell them to stop updating every row, if possible, as that seems like a mistake or at least an anti-pattern.

They said you get throttled, and then I walked them through a hypothetical which clearly showed that F64 is unlikely to work for us. We run 100s of workspace and cover multiple clients over multiple sectors globally.Not even 2 hours later, one of my clients who have moved over to Fabric (not sure of their capacity, but probably F64, since that is the flavour MS lead the pitch calls with), started having issues with dashboards and my analysts just sent me laughing emoji saying 'we where just talking about this...' and included a screen grab where you could see their dashboards where timing out because of capacity limits.Anyway, previously the enterprise option would have been great, and we would have gotten that, but that is a different story...Fabric, personally, not sold on.

I inherited a Synapse environment, struggled with all the weirdness of it for a couple of years, and then found Microsoft changing directions (again) on their home grown data stack, to Fabric, without any real clear guidance or easy way of migrating.So I didn't. I just setup my own stack using Azure's base resources(basic storage accounts, containerized and function apps, Azure SQL, data factory for orchestration) that were less likely to be discontinued every few years and then let the business choose what BI solution they wanted to move to.It ended up cutting our costs to like 1/4th of what I had projected it to be at if we would have migrated to Fabric. At the time, there was no migration plan for users of older Synapse to Fabric and it was going to be a re-implementation for us anyways.While I wish Microsoft the best with Fabric, if it's anything like the product model they had for Synapse, it will be dead in like 5 years too. Synapse utilized many of Azure's base resources all linked together, but their development was forked and specialized to Synapse - so they're not 1:1 migrations. To further add problems to this, based on feature requests we made and escalated support tickets to engineering, the development of those forks were done by a small overseas team that basically had no bandwidth but bug fixes. Which is why the actual number of features implemented in Synapse past its first year were non-existent, and why everything was so quirky in it.",

If I have any advice to people learning now, is actually to use it. However, **change your learning focus**, the goal is **not to learn the specificities of the language** you're coding with, but to **learn system design instead**. Focus on gaining *formal* knowledge of software engineering, rather than the trial-and-error/self-taught approach of your predecessors. Look up Onion Architecture, Hexagonal -- how uncle bob has unified all of these with Clean Architecture. Understand SOLID fundamentally for clear code segregation, experiment on your own to internalize these concepts, so you can then prompt the AI to do the same; learn UML to represent your systems, do C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams, design everything; and experiment.A different approach than your predecessors, and you'll outpace them all.",

We iterate a bit and land on something that's almost ok.The code produced yes of course is pure trash but that's ok. I then cut up the mocks into functional components and fix the things I don't like.At the end I realized all it really did was save some typing during the design phase, if I tried to use it to produce any production code of more than a few lines it just couldn't do it.I had some use* bugs that were pretty obvious, Claude could not figure out the dependant arrays, it couldn't figure out how to correctly useMemo or useEffect, it would solve one problem create another solve that problem and the first problem would return. None of those problems were hard to solve, it was clear Claude couldn't remember or factor in multiple requirements.I've concluded that ai is not capable of building any real functionality and coding with ai is still more of a pipedream than reality. Now I've done enough to be convinced vibe coders and advocates just aren't very good devs.It was good for visualizing the app, and giving me some design direction, but none of that code is usable and for every minute it saved it wasted 10 of mine. In the past I've had success with small syntax / logic tasks, processing and formatting data. Productive use outside of this is all hype, none of it's real, there is no dev job apocalypse and most importantly deep driving how LLMs work shows they are not AI and are not capable of being AGI no matter how much money or r&d you throw at it.",

Thus, they decided to remake the game from scratch for phones and tablets. This was outsourced to a different team, which did it in C++ instead of Java. Performance has historically been the main explanation of why C++ was chosen, but realistically thats probably not entirely true. This version of the game was VERY different from the java version. Eventually the goal was parity, which meant Mojang getting more hands on with the mobile version, developing it to also support other (non pc) platforms. Its arounds this point where console edition turned into what is now bedrock edition.So yes, it would be easier (and probably a lot better) if there was only one version of the game, but thats not what we ended up with.Based on how the development went, yes, they essentially redid the entire game and tried to make it feel like minecraft. No, they didn't really have to do that. Most code is, at least to a general level, language agnostic. If you have a functioning object or function, it shouldn't be hard to transfer that. The main problem arises when you have a standard you work with.",

Having two seperate versions of the game predates the Microsoft purchase by a LONG time.The first non-Java version of minecraft was minecraft pocket edition for android, all the way back in 2011. It was released as part of a deal between Sony and Mojang to make a minecraft version for the Sony Xperia Play, which was a gaming phone. Think about how shit the hardware on a phone would have been back in 2011, and you can see why they would need to rewrite the game in the more optimised and lightweight C++. Also worth noting, all the way back then, the game was very simple and didn’t have that much content, it wouldn’t have been that hard to rewrite. It was still in beta, with the really old terrain generation and even basic features like sprinting and the hunger bar hadn’t been added yet. The old, shitty pocket edition version you remember from your childhood was basically identical to Java edition at the time.According to autobiographies about Notch, at this time mojang was still a really small company with probably 10 or less employees and the rewrite was mostly entrusted to a single guy who was known as “the smart one”.Later that year they copied over the C++ engine for iOS, then next year to the Xbox 360, then the year after that to the PS3. Microsoft didn’t buy minecraft until 3 years later. They didn’t rewrite the game engine at all, they just got all the different existing C++ versions for consoles and phones onto the same page in terms of updates, then unified them into what we now know as bedrock edition and made them cross play.",

He wrote it in Java in part to just learn programming and Open GL, he was an IT guy, and this was all just for fun. Java is accessible, and a popular language for academics, but also a popular language in the enterprise world, so there's lots and lots of resources for learning and doing and using.Microsoft bought Mojang, and therefore Minecraft. Java is a product created by Sun Microsystems - a competitor of Microsoft, and Microsoft is not going to condone and legitimize a competitor's product.There's some argument that Java won't run on phones? Are you fucking kidding me? And who says this? Microsoft, of course... Android OS is a JVM on top of a Linux kernel - and constitutes the single most widely deployed OS and platform, and Open GL is the most portable 3D graphics platform there is. So that's a whole bunch of bullshit.Of course Microsoft rewrote it in C++, because they explicitly won't allow a JVM on the XBox platform. They would have written it in C#, but at the time .NET Core was 2 years away, and its initial release was a barely functioning prototype and wasn't all that portable. As much as Microsoft hates C++, at least no one formally owns it and they can swallow that pill. Their legacy is also largely built upon it. It's a neutral territory that they are willing to port.So in a word: politics.",

        "body": "You have to look at the timeline on how the technology developed. Earliest mobile devices that ran Java was launched in 2001, and Sun Micro quickly followed it by Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME). This started to gain some traction among the device makers, namely Nokia and Siemens, and lead to the first games you can buy and run through WAP and sold through app stores included on the phone. FWIW, iPhone (1) didn't come out until 2007. And probably the earliest recognizable Android phone, the Motorola Droid, didn't release until 2009. Notch launched Minecraft Java Edition in 2009 but it didn't gain traction until 2010. By then, J2ME was almost a decade old, designed for FAR MORE PRIMITIVE CPUs, and no understanding of GPUs. Not going to go over history of Minecraft much. EDIT: Except to add that Minecraft Pocket Edition (aka Minecraft PE) was actually written in C++, and when ported to iOS and Android, standard transpiler was probably used to create Java/Dalvik code and Objective-C code. (see Minecraft Wiki). In 2017, Microsoft acquired Mojang and all stuff related to Minecraft. Yes, Notch WANTED a big corp to buy his stuff. But one of the reasons is due to all the different ports to different platforms, the codebase became fragmented. There's a Pocket Edition, there's a Windows 10 Edition, and there are the various console editions. Maintainence and bug tracking was eating up a ton of time. And Java... is a big long in the tooth. And having to pay Oracle (which bought out Sun Micro, and thus, own Java) for a license is probably not in Microsoft's long-term plans. So Mojang and Microsoft pushed out \"Bedrock Edition\" in 2017, which supposedly united a lot of the codebase in the program core, by ~~rewriting~~ basing the core in C++ with the Pocket Edition codebase, and because C++ was the most \"universal\" language. The program core will call the OS language libraries to do native processing (Dalvik / Java on Android, Objective-C on iOS, and whatever else platforms).",

I'll explain.I work on a niche embedded device with extremely complex math involved - math that is handled by PhD physicists and hurts my brain to think about.  But I'm a very experienced and knowledgeable software engineer.My current task: prepare for the release of a 10k-line C++ library written by an excellent developer who has since left the company. The library is a port of a bunch of Matlab scripts written by the scientists. There is an off-by-one error somewhere that's causing one certain array result to be shifted by one element; presumably the Matlab code is correct, but that's not a given.My previous task: there's a 20k-line C module written by a certifiable genius decades ago, and a newer C++ wrapper application that works in concert with it. One part of that C++ code has a method that needs to be called in a thread-safe way at certain times in the runtime lifecycle. Figure out where in the legacy C program that call belongs (perhaps multiple places), and add a line or two of code in those places.I've worked in very different code bases and industries, but it's often similar: the task may take four hours or four days, but often results in changing a \"0\" to a \"1\" or adding or rearranging a few lines of code.The fun and easy stuff, where you take a spec and write hundreds of lines of new code, that's all done by junior people. I get to review their code, but that's not all that interesting.Edit: I remember about 15 years ago at one of my first senior roles becoming fed up with this....in my mind, I imagined being a skilled and creative barista who gets hired by a specialty coffee shop, but spends most of the time at work sweeping floors while others do the actual coffee. It was very frustrating. But I liked management even less, so here I am the stuckee with the hard problems, paid appropriately which is nice, but wishing I was a junior programmer again.",

In fact, when I was young and the only programming language I knew was BASIC, I realized that you didn't even need FOR-loops; you could accomplish the same thing with just IF-statements and GOTOs.So why did BASIC use FOR loops at all? Because sometimes you want a loop that iterates using a counter variable, and writing a FOR-loop makes it so much easier to write and read than using only IFs and GOTOs.Okay, so why do some languages also use while-loops in addition to for-loops? Because sometimes the logic you want to implement is clearer as a for-loop with a counter and/or current element, and sometimes the logic is clearer as a loop that continues *while* a condition remains true.Some programming languages allow the use of an *until*\\-loop, a loop that keeps running *until* a condition is met. An until-loop is functionally equivalent to a while-not-loop, so why is there a need for an until-loop?Well, it's not that there's a specific *need* for it, it's that sometimes the logic is clearer when you realize that a body of code needs to be repeated over and over *until* a specific condition is met -- or that the body needs to repeatedly execute with the goal of causing that condition to be true.",

The best outcome is one where you're able to do stuff like make your own implementation just by reasoning about it years later. The passing outcome is the one where you think \"oh hey, this reminds me of that DSA thing …\" and are able to look it up. Also: To be able to tell when you can create something without too much effort, and when it's best to just look it up.And a lot of the DSA stuff you are going to use as library imports, even standard library imports.

DSA isn’t just about memorizing solutions; it’s about recognizing patterns and knowing how to approach problems. One thing that really helped me was doing spaced repetition: revisit problems at increasing intervals, a few days later, then a week, then two weeks, you get it. This forces your brain to recall actively rather than just re-reading.Also, focus on understanding the logic and pattern behind a problem rather than the exact code. If you can explain the approach in words or pseudocode, you’ll remember it better and can reconstruct the code when needed.Then, reimplement problems from scratch without looking at your old code. Even 10–15 minutes to redo a problem is more effective than reading it again. Over time, the patterns stick, and you don’t need to memorize every solution line by line.",

        "body": "First off, these are two very different languages. Java is object oriented and deals with more modern concepts. C++ is an older language and probably provides a better understand of some concepts like memory management and resources. Java is typically used for more full stuck development positions, while C++ is generally used more for embedded systems. Do either one of them interest you more than the other? Things to consider:* Is it one or the other or will you be taking both eventually? If both take the C++ one first since the lower level concepts may be easier to learn before you've learned the higher level concepts. If you can only take one programming class ever, I think the concepts in Java are more important to modern programming. * Do you know anything about the teachers? All things equal I'd pick the class with the better teacher. A good teacher makes it more engaging to learn. * If your a CS major or need to take later classes, which class will be more important to your next ones? If you need to take Java 101 and then Java 102 then opt for Java, but if you're going to be an EE and never take a programming class again then maybe C++ is the better choice. * Which one sounds more appealing to you?* Are you more interested in embedded systems and high perfomance computing (C++) or modern applications and web development (Java)? For me personally, the concepts in C++ were useful to learn, but I've very rarely had to worry about things like memory management and performance in my jobs.",

Most people might answer just the question of being a software engineer and not address the technical artist part.The question is what kind of programming does a technical artist need to do. You may or may not have good ideas of what that entails.In general, it helps to have a college degree in CS or software engineering to be a software engineer. The credentials of getting a degree show, to an extent, that you have accomplished something challenging. Whether you're any good at the end is debatable. Some turn out great. Some can't recall much of what they learn. Even so, the paper (degree) is worth a lot.But it costs money, takes time, and can be challenging, especially if you already have a career.Some go to bootcamps, but you need to do some research. They turn to go too fast for some and they are expensive, but not as much as colleges. These typically last 3-6 months and is basically full-time (like a 9-5 experience).You can get a Master's degree in software engineering if you have an undergrad degree in something. Some masters degrees don't require any prior programming knowledge (some require a CS or equivalent degree, so you need to do research).Also, you could try asking /r/cscareerquestions or perhaps some reddit closer to your experience.",

You should ask around in your industry to learn what the most important skills are for a technical artists. And also what they do day-to-day. One mistake I made early in my career is liking the idea of a job WAY more than the job itself. Turns out, I really hate drawing in CAD, as much as the idea of designing ships and small submarines sounded cool.

Any comprehensive JS tutorial is perfectly good — I would go through the entire thing.The thing to note is that learning TS does not require \"unlearning\" JS. Changing existing JS code to TS does not involve deleting, or editing, any of the existing JS code — it simply requires adding a bit more on. Therefore, you will not be wasting any time at all by learning JS — literally 100% of that knowledge will still be relevant when you add on the TS knowledge.On the other hand, if you begin learning TS first, it's not the worst thing ever. However, it will likely confuse you a lot more at the beginning. TS code has to exist in two \"worlds\" at the same time: the \"runtime world\" (i.e., JavaScript), and the \"type system world\". It's very important to understand those two worlds, and if you're learning TS right off the bat, you'll probably conflate them a lot, which means that you'll misunderstand a lot of the core concepts.Instead, it's better to get really comfortable in JavaScript (which, as I said above, is one of the two \"worlds\"), and then learn TS later, adding the second \"world\" on top of that.",

TS helps you define/codify the interface of a function (both input and output), so that when you're calling a function: - it catches any input data mismatch (like supplying a string to a function that expects numbers).- it passes on information about the output (or result) of a function so that it makes your life easier when writing code about accessing data within that output/result.All TS does (in comparison to JS) is serve as a developer tool to pass datatype information around in the code editor. It's a massive help, but also not entirely useful when writing one-off code in a learning environment. For me personally, as an example, I go for JS when writing code in a leetcode-style environment, but TS when doing a project or something more involved. IMO getting tied down to having to write boilerplate-y stuff when learning a language is a drag, and may discourage you from progressing further.> slightly leaning towards JS fundamentals.TS wouldn't help you learn how to walk an array or perform DOM manipulation.

        "body": "TL;DR - No. It is a factor, but not a significant one.There are a lot of things converging right now, the most important one concerning credit.During COVID, central banks and governments, including the US, radically expanded credit to accommodate the COVID crisis. Consequently money was flowing in an unnaturally free and cheap way across the economy since.Since then, interest rates have gone up, money has become tighter and more scarce, and the \"party\" is coming to an end so to speak.When money is tighter, consumers spend less, businesses hire less, people invest less, people are more risk averse, etc. The economy as a whole starts to slow down.So startups that were once being flooded with money by investors throwing everything they could at anything resembling \"tech\" suddenly see their investments dry up. Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.So everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.And that is what we're going through now.Are there some jobs being made obsolete by AI? Yeah, probably. But that is a secondary factor. The \"crash\" following the \"high\" of reckless monetary policy is the primary reason the economy is crashing now, in tech as much as everywhere else.Hope that helps you.",

This leads most (nearly all) new programmers to learn a wrong lesson: That learning programming languages is hard. It's realy not. Once you know a few, picking up another is a matter of a weekend and a few hours reading the docs. C#, Java and C++ share most of their concepts. They might have slightly different keywords and implementations, but that's just the surface layer. Once you know one of them really well (I mean really well, like understanding and being able to explain WHY thing are the way they are, and how they work under the hood) you can really write in all 3. For Backend developent, you can basically choose what you want. C# and Java are better than C++ (in this specific case), many people also like Python or JS, Ruby, Go, PHP or rust. I could proably list 10 more languages if I took the time. I for one wrote backends in Python, JS, C# and rust and personally, the only language I didn't like out of those 4, was JavaScript. And, a last short point: Look at your local job market. Where I live (when I looked last), C# and Python were more popular than Java for Backend Dev specifically for example, but Java is also used for Android Dev and some Desktop UIs. But this does vary a lot from place to place. The world is not a monolith, it's a set of microservices.",

There's a lot of ways to do this. You may have a code to enter the room, but that simply links your user record to that room on the server side, so you don't need an additional token on the client side.

Your son is on the right track; he is learning by encountering problems, and thinking how to solve them himself using the tools at his disposals.

Most of the tutorials you find online are articles on blogs or YouTube videos, and they tend to cover some specific topic. In order to get the big picture that you need when you're learning a new language or large framework, you'd need to read/watch dozens of those types of tutorials, often from multiple authors, and try to synthesize general knowledge from that hodgepodge of specifics. I'd avoid any book with the word \"cookbook\" in the title for the same reason.What you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective. To me, that mostly means getting a good book and working your way through it, but courses like the ones offered online by Stanford, Harvard, etc. would also work well.",

You need to learn to create the discrete steps that make the computer do what you want it to do. I fully do understand that your ultimate goal is to create your game, but that's a *future goal*. (A new carpenter doesn't directly start building intricate Victorian furniture. They start with learning to work with hand tools and with the grain of the wood and gradually work their way up.)Take two steps back and start with general programming. The suggestions I give you now are tailored to your desire of making games in the end:+ Start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is a free, textual, extremely practice oriented course that is the current first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\". This course will give you a solid general programming foundation and understanding along with teaching you the *Python programming language*.+ Then, move on to [Making Games with Python and Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) - also free to read online. This book will lay the foundation for game programming. Maybe, if your game is simple enough, you can even realize it with Pygame already.+ Then, move on to Godot. And here, I'd suggest that you shell out a few bucks (it's really cheap) and buy the [Humble \"Learn Godot in 2025\" bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/learn-godot-in-2025-complete-course-bundle-software) (available for 2 more days at the time of writing this comment) - I've bought a previous similar bundle and can attest that the courses are excellent and well worth the money.My recommendation for Python first comes from GDScript's similarities to it. GDScript is basically a Python dialect with some additions for Godot and some peculiarities. If you know Python, learning GDScript will be much, much easier.",

Once that is covered, you'll be able to do a lot of things (still, it will be laborious and dirty. But the important part is being able to craft stuff).You'll then enter that part where you just try out stuff and document yourself with the eventual learning of x technology or y algorithm. This point is where some can get stuck in the infamous tutorial hell where you just drift from one tutorial to another one w.o. ever really achieving something. Thus why I suggested earlier to \"just tackle your own problems\".Now that I explained what I would advice and why I would advice it, I would still want to add this : encountering and trying to solve your problems rather than doing tutorials w.o. ends is one thing. But it shouldn't mean that you'll have to discard every \"how to\" you'll find.Rather, that those \"how to\" should really be about stuff you don't know like a specific technology that wasn't already covered (like networking, oop, shaders...) or that you thought you knew but turns out it doesn't make sense and you have to correct your knowledge about it. This way, you'll ensure to develop your skills rather than stagnate relearning the basics n times. Eventually, get (or create) a map of what you learn and what you want to / have to learn. This will be a great tool to :1. Motivate yourself by helping visualise your progress 2. Organise what you need to learn and whenTldr : yeah, as soon as possible, try and just build stuff.

This develops strong fundamentals and problem solving skills, which turns you into a better programmer. 2. You got into it because you found the process enjoyable, you liked computers, or because you had a strong desire to make something. You didn’t get into it because it was considered a relatively low barrier to entry career with high pay. So you had people who were good at reading the fucking manual, and they only got into this because they really wanted to. It filtered out a lot of people who today just coast by on tutorials or generative AI. Or the people like Pirate Software, who legitimately just write bad code but think they’re hot shit.",

What we did have was the first 8-bit/16-bit consumer computers (Apple, Commodore 64, IBM). So in high school I learned through paper magazines ('Byte','Compute', etc.) where you had to copy your games by hand into the computer. Somehow the local library did have subscription to a few of these. Game piracy branding (think custom splash screens) was thing but you had to know a friend or a friend of a friend with a modem. Slowing down to actually read what I was typing in may have helped in learning what the code was doing.You can see what the magazines looked like at archive.org:Byte Magaine: [https://archive.org/details/BYTE-MAGAZINE-COMPLETE/197509\\_Byte\\_Magazine\\_Vol\\_00-01\\_The\\_Worlds\\_Greatest\\_Toy/](https://archive.org/details/BYTE-MAGAZINE-COMPLETE/197509_Byte_Magazine_Vol_00-01_The_Worlds_Greatest_Toy/)Compute!

Just keyboard and screen. Want to put text on the screen, figure out how to print in the correct place. Want graphics, hope there is some sprite API otherwise literally put bit & bytes into memory in the correct place to draw stuff. I'm pretty sure we had to be able to build various data structures (linked-list, stack, queue, tree) without a library (as best as one could) as those data type would become part of a standard library in any 'new' language framework.By the 90's there were more programming books leading up to the 'C for Dummies' in the late 90's.

Hell no, but also you don't need to.But you should be building up a baseline of knowledge over time.What's the system to learning all of that faster? Make it *hard* for yourself to look the information up. Brains are inherently lazy - if it is easy to look something up, your brain won't bother spending the energy to remember something. But if it is a royal pain in the ass to look something up, eventually your brain will just be \"alright, fine, I'll remember it because I don't want to have to bother looking it up again\".This is part of why any kind of self-testing where you look at the answers right away sucks. Your brain will be \"whatever, I'll just get it wrong and then I get to see the answer\". Where if it is more like \"I'm going to sit in this goddamn chair as long as it takes to get it right\" you'll start to get better at actually putting your brain to work.This is one of the reason actual honest to god paper books are actually really good for learning. They've got great info, but they slow you down and make looking up that information take a bit of time. That's actually really good for learners.",

In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.If you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.Typically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code: void fn() { int x; // Stuff... int y; // Stuff...The stack memory will look like: [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]So even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.As far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.To blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.But the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower. This means YOU CAN write a C compiler for the Analytical Engine and compile this program for it, and it would run. The gears would whirl and turn, and move in lockstep, and the output would be as you expect.",

The return value is then on the stack and can be copied. In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.The stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. There's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the \"Instruction Pointer\" (IP). It can \"jump\" to where a function and and then \"jump\" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy. Since it uses a stack\\*, it must know where on the stack the function has to work with local variables. The \"Stack Pointer\" (SP) simply points to the top of the stack (new stack frames go on \"top\" (usually a higher address). \\* You could compile C code for a computer that doesn't use a stack but then the compiler would just generate code that creates a stack at runtime using the memory.

Ideally something that has you implement the data structures and the algorithms, but guides you through it visually.Like give me the visual representation of a data structure, give me an unimplemented interface and have me fill out the methods, have tests, visualise what I have so far vs what should it should be.This is the kind of experience I had at Uni. For example when learning DFS, BFS, djikstras, A*, etc, we were provided a little GUI that showed the actual searching of our algorithm vs what should be happening.I haven't been able to find anything like this.I'e been thinking of taking open source DSA implementations and building something that does this myself.If anyone else out there knows of something like this, please share.",

There's really more harm done by misunderstanding or forcing others to look things up, than what you are saving.Preferred language by whom? Why do you care? If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.Data structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.I've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals. Java is a memory-managed high-level language similar to C#, therefore still in the root vein of C, but with many more features, all which are irrelevant for DSA.Use whatever your teachers/mentors know best to reduce the friction of setting up any environments or getting stuck on syntax features. Then ignore the language and learn computer science, it goes a far longer way than any single language.",

That's how you overwhelm yourself and crash out. You can either start with the UI first and first start off with hardcoded data and then work with dynamic mock data (use json) to symulate your backend, until you are happy with the interface and functionality.If you'd prefer to focus on the backend instead, you can still work like you were used to before (no interface, just code and terminal output). That way, you can implement each bit one by one. Once your sections are working individually, start combining them through API calls. Graph things out if you need visual guides. Visualisations can help. Create UML diagrams, design your database tables, draw connections between your components to plan how they will communicate between each other, read documentation and forums like Stack Overflow, etc.Yes, this will take trial and error. There is no skipping that. It's a necessary part of learning. Take a step back. Go back to the drawing board if you have to and plan out what you need to do.",

Since you've asked such a broad question, I don't think I can do much better than just pointing you to [the Spring documentation website](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html). For quick answers to specific subtopics, I've found [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) to also be pretty good.If you can post the code and ask *specific* questions, like \"where's the program's entry point\" or \"how does this function get called\" or \"what does this annotation mean\", then people can try to give you more specific answers. But the answers might not make much sense without background knowledge of how Spring works.As for Kafka: Kafka itself is not super complicated to use -- it just acts like a fancy persistent queue.

I normally start at the entry point (main function if applicable) and go deeper into the project from there, by following used classes, function calls and so on. If the project is big, I always have a whiteboard and / or stack of papers to take notes and draw diagrams of how it all connects. This step will take time, maybe hours or even days, depending on the size of the codebase. I also like to make small changes, like commenting out function calls, to see what breaks.

Apache Kafka, based on its description, is known for use with real-time data feeds. Based on these 2, I'm guessing that I have a web client that sends or POSTs a certain data and a receiving end (maybe a database) receives or stores something, and that latency or throughout is pretty important that we are using Apache Kafka to manage multiple POSTs or other HTTP methods.",

It’s totally normal to feel lost starting out, freshman year is the perfect time to explore!Python is a great starting point; it’ll teach you programming basics without too much syntax pain. Alongside that, I’d suggest focusing on three things this year: fundamentals, small projects, and learning the tools professionals use. For fundamentals, try practicing simple problems on sites like LeetCode (easy), HackerRank, or even just coding exercises from Python tutorials. For projects, start tiny like a calculator, a to-do list app, or a small scraper, so you can actually finish something and feel progress. It’s also useful to get comfortable with Git/GitHub early; version control is super important even for small projects. Once you’re comfortable, branch out. Try a web app with Flask/Django, or automate something for yourself. As for making money, small freelance gigs or contests can pay and build experience. The key is consistency: 30–60 minutes coding a day + finishing small projects will help more than trying to learn everything at once.",

Each pipeline runs turbo build --filter app-name and only deploys when its paths or shared packages change. Use feature flags (LaunchDarkly or Unleash) to hide unfinished modules so you can merge to main safely. For shared code, keep packages private and link via workspaces; add Changesets to version only when you actually need a publish, otherwise just bump internal packages and let turbo’s cache handle rebuilds. If you truly need hard isolation but one domain, use Next.js multi‑zone or Azure Front Door path routing so /community, /registration, etc. point at separate app artifacts.For APIs across apps, I’ve paired LaunchDarkly and Azure Front Door with DreamFactory to auto-generate secure endpoints over shared databases without writing boilerplate.TL;DR: monorepo + per‑app pipelines + feature flags; multi‑zone if you need stricter deploy isolation.",

It took me the introductory course (with an extra course I took, because I was struggling) and a practical course with a group project in my 2. semester. After that course, I felt like I can built stuff that's really helpful for me. And that's what I did. Been programming for 13 years now. It's definitely not about being smart. Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.My advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.BTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses. They were always interesting and I always got some sort of satisfaction out of it learning new things and solving problems. Most of the time, I was the one pulling the group. So, don't worry if it's hard at first. Because it is. It might click some day, but it takes a lot of practice! You have to sit down and write code. A LOT! Don't skip any homework. Write and practice as much code as possible.But I also have to ask: What kind of CS MASTERS needs to give an intro to PYTHON? That's nuts! How did you even get into the masters without a CS bachelor?",

Learn to allow yourself to experience these things without negativity or devaluing your self-worth. Being comfortable with that opens up your mind for everything else. That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 :smirking_face:With that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then \"you're not cut out for it.\"I find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd. Don't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something. If you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.My curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years. I learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them. That's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow. Here's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12? - How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop? - How do I see if my end result is 12?- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables? - Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?So on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code. Building a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.Hope that helps! I'm a fellow beginner, so you might even be building something I find difficult right now lmao.",

Spend as much time on a whiteboard as in any particular software, talking to a client, breaking down what functionality needs to be delivered, etc. For an app, you're going to spend a lot more time in something like Figma - or, hell, PowerPoint - than you will in an IDE to start off.People aren't as likely to have a full design of everything these days as they were back twenty years ago - deliver prototypes to the client fast, correct as you go is more common - but still you're going to spend at least a little bit of time figuring out what the app needs to *do* before you start writing code.So, like, a process I might recommend to someone new might be:\\* Figure out your major requirements, produce some GUI mockups.\\* Figure out what data you need to store and maybe make an ERD (entity relationship diagram)\\* Sketch out the parts of the system - what's in the app, what's in the backend? What information do they need to communicate? What tech stacks will they use?\\* Once you've got that all figured, write the smallest sliver of one part of it that can possibly be tested.\\* Then write another small sliver that connects to the first one you created, see if they work together.\\* They probably won't work together, so rewrite as needed.\\* Repeat until you have a big enough chunk of functionality you can show/demo to see if it actually meets your requirements.\\* Revise your requirements as needed, write more tiny pieces of functionality, test them with everything else, rewrite, repeat.Anyways, don't be afraid of scrapping code and starting over. It isn't a big deal. You'll do it lots and that's *fine*. Even professionals end up tossing code very often, beginners should do it routinely.",

Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)There is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.Since I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: \"Feature A needs Feature B\", or \"Feature C leads to Feature D\"4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First \"wireframes\" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to \"test\" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same \"almost-UML\" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, \"fully\" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.This is not \"the best\" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.EDIT: I forgot Step 0: I actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the \"demand\" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable. I learned a lot about the domain though, so it's not wasted time, it made my second attempt so much easier and better.",

That way back end and front end development can work asynchronously while PMs and Leads can change that interface as requirements change; each side just needs to communicate and fill the requirements / facilities offered, and software comes together.This is assuming enterprise/business software. I work in games, where a major early milestone is a vertical slice, so development is feature oriented towards a minimum viable set of features and minimum viable functionality to demonstrate them.

And I’ve done all backend first, just boring little unit tests, inching forward one little piece of functionality at a time.

You use it when you wanna spin up something fast, (an MVP/POC), or when your use case is very basic and fully supported, or when you are simply not confident enough in your \"backend\" skills. You mentioned you knew how to do auth, but as a beginner, there's no way you can do it properly. So even something like firebase ends up on top for now.But if you ever wanna build a real product, and if you have the knowledge, have very specific needs and solutions, have full control over everything and learn how to do backend infrastructure properly, that's when you do it yourself.",

If you want to do games, quant, embedded, learn C++. Maybe C for embedded first. If you want to do Linux and like low level tooling learn C, maybe experiment with Rust in a few years. You don't have to do any of these things you just need to do one of them. Of you are unsure, rest assured that most computer science students will learn only C++, C or Java in their 3 year degree and they tend to end up with a basis of knowledge that allows them to pivot to whatever they want later when they decide that.

Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?It could be sufficient for your purposes, but more of an alternative to using React. Likely the technique you're looking for is what we call templating. It's also what SSGs use.I'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.Static site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.You can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)Some of the ones I've used include* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)You can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There's 370 of them currently, some general-purpose, some special-purpose. Given that you seem to have some experience with node.js you could have a look at 11ty to see if it seems to cover your needs.",

In my case it was building an encyclopedia - based on the entry title in the url, it would grab information about that entry from the backend database and populate the template's title, description, etc, with that information.Anyway, I don't know enough about React to say exactly how you would do it, but it might be worth looking into seeing if the router you're using has any kind of dynamic routing as an option and go from there.",

Whatever matches your interests. You'll always be learning- Build up your knowledge while building many projects utilizing Git. Push a few into production if applicable - Always be curious about what's going on under the hood and dive deep into books- Find the fun in what you're doing and learning Then, when you've built a lot of personal projects (without following step-by-step tutorials) and maybe pushed some into production:- Go for a masters in an adjacent field (CS, software engineering, etc) if you can- Apply to jobs and internships Avoid paid bootcamps if you can. I heard that the vast majority of recent bootcampers don't get placements, which follows the unemployment rates of CS majors.I believe all of the information within a bootcamp and CS degree are available online free..If you absolutely need a job within a few months and absolutely want this field, well, I recommend being wary of Reddit. It'll be filled with countless people who have way more experience than us who are struggling to find work. I'd recommend going through a list of fields (search up developer roadmap github for ideas of what they look like), then seeing which ones are hiring the most.Also, try checking out github repos for remote work. Once you find something that's hiring a lot, you can start doing your research on a process suitable for you.I'm assuming that the faster you want a job, the more effort you'll have to put into networking, applying, and finding unorthodox methods to get in. Some people even resort to cheating to get placements..Look into IT roles as well to see if they're hiring. You may have to get a certification (like the comptia ones) or get a helpdesk or desktop support role and move up from there with more experience and certs. .If you find something, put me on too!",

        "body": "Write an HTTP server.HTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.Seriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.You can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.Now you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says \"Hello World!\" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.But you could... If you get ambitious...You can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...As for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types: class GET {}; class POST {}; using request = std::variant; std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);The stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream: class GET { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &); }; class POST { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &); };You'll probably want a response message: class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };To make an object, you make it streamable: class http_server: public std::streambuf {};If you want to parse text, you overload a couple things: class http_server: public std::streambuf { int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override; };And you can plug that into a stream: http_server svr; std::iostream ios{&svr};You can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.I demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.But if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",

Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets and personal data etc.).If you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know \"above the fold\" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)You don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.Saved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview. Maybe have a local copy checked out and built in case you get the opportunity to demo or something. I would look positively on a candidate offering to show me a project we are discussing actually running, even if I didn't take them up on it.Doesn't matter for recruiters. Most of them are even less likely than us to look at projects in detail, they just pass these things along to client firms. Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty. They'll focus more on your CV itself and experience etc.In general don't worry too much. If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much. Honestly, I mostly use projects to gauge the level of interest a candidate has in writing software, not their actual ability, as we expect that to be low at entry level. You have no idea how many people we get that can't point to anything they've done outside of education, and can't demonstrate any ability or approach to solving a problem they weren't prepared for.",

String it together. Test the performance etc. Then do a second pass where you design and create good code boundaries/interfaces.\\- Getting the interfaces right alongside the above.Good, necessary abstractions with simple interfaces make it easy to add and change code later, and easy to write minimal (integration) test code. It's very hard to get right, so developers who can are worth keeping happy IMO!",

        "body": "If you’re looking to get back into programming and want something practical that you can tinker with, leaning on languages like Java and C# (.NET) is a solid choice. Both are mature, widely supported, and have a lot of libraries that can make building things like a hotel PMS or a roster scheduler much more manageable. Java will give you platform independence, so you could run your programs on Windows, Linux, or Mac without much hassle, while C# and .NET are extremely well-integrated into Windows environments and offer rapid development with a lot of built-in UI frameworks. For your particular projects, SQL is going to be almost unavoidable if you want to store reservations, employee details, or scheduling data efficiently. Learning to combine either Java or C# with a relational database like MariaDB would cover most of what you need, and it’s exactly how most professional systems handle persistent data.For the hotel PMS, even if you already use Opera Cloud, building your own simplified version can be a great learning experience. You’ll get hands-on insight into the data structures and workflows behind reservations, room management, and billing, which will inform your understanding of what a full-scale system does behind the scenes. For the roster builder, the challenge lies more in logic and rules enforcement—handling days off, labor law restrictions, and employee availability can be complex, and practicing this in code will improve your problem-solving skills more than anything else. You could start simple, storing employee information and preferences in a database, then gradually implement more advanced scheduling algorithms as you learn.Here me out though: some of the most efficient POS systems ever made weren’t built on top of an operating system at all—they were written in assembly language. By coding directly to the hardware, developers could squeeze out incredible speed and reliability, especially in environments where every millisecond counts, like retail or hospitality checkout systems. Modern frameworks make development faster and easier, but looking at those old systems is a good reminder that understanding what’s happening at the low level can make you a much stronger programmer, even if you never touch assembly yourself. It’s all about learning how things work under the hood, and how your high-level code translates into actual performance. This also saves a ton of money on client end systems as the hardware doesn't need to support a full operating system since you've built it to be application specific. You wouldn't use a pc for what you can do with a 5 buck Arduino.If you're willing to learn a new language though, I'd recommend c++ as you can compile it for any operating system.",

It's long enough to see people \"discover\" ideas that were already here and then charge forward on them instead of looking at the history of what happened to them the first time they came around. And it can be a little exhausting learning a language that is 95% another language except they replaced all the `$variable` interpolations with `${variable}` and this one uses MODULA-inspired instead of ALGOL-inspired syntax. Or yet another way to wrap SQL. Or yet another way to abstract HTTP.Sometimes, legitimately good new ideas come along. Package management is pretty great. I appreciate algebraic effects (although back in the day we just called them \"hooks\" and got nasty with them). Linters and opinionated formatters are a good call. But our whole discipline has a \"not enough historians\" problem and we have a tendency to get all shiny-eyed over a new framework or language or protocol that is a lot like one that came before except it didn't learn the lessons that one learned when it hit usage, so we get to make the same mistakes again.(Beware learning Common LISP; you will see the inspiration for a *lot* of features and be grumpy they don't work as well as they do in LISP. ;) ).",

The emphasis always has to be on building projects, not taking classes.

Since you want C++ with game-focused projects, I’d recommend a mix of bite-sized lessons and small, incremental projects. Something that worked for me was picking tiny games, like guess-the-number, a simple text RPG, or a basic snake game, and building them step by step while learning the relevant C++ concepts as I went. That way, the code actually does something visible, which keeps it engaging. For resources, Codecademy’s C++ track has short, interactive lessons and mini projects, not free, but the interactive style is easy to follow. YouTube also has tons of free mini-game tutorials where you can follow along and build small projects. CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science isn’t C++ only, but its problem sets include games and are very project-based, plus it’s hands-on and video-driven. Building your own small projects every week or two also helps you learn syntax, loops, conditionals, OOP, and more in a way that text-heavy tutorials never do. The key is to alternate between learning a concept and immediately applying it in a tiny project, so you get a progressive experience without drowning in text.",

E.g. I'll leave comments like `// this is a workaround for $remote_bug: `I also generally like [the advice in the Rust stdlib on error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/error/index.html#common-message-styles), which kinda boils down to writing down what you expected and possibly what can be done about the error. Even just thinking about that should aid you in how you architect your code.> I hand comments but they're for me to remember what each section was and did.Often what happens to manage stuff like that is to break code out into a function or module with a descriptive name.",

        "body": "It’s always a good idea to include some documentation with your personal projects. I usually have 2 or 3 .txt to track everything. For me it starts with my planning and it follows through what I’m doing as I work, so if I get pulled away to something else or pick up a project again after a while I have detailed note on what I was doing and (maybe more importantly) what I want to do. notes.txt: this file is just for my revision and work, I don’t share it with anyone. 1) Concept. I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. 3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. 4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. 5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. List out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. Every day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. Copy across what you’re doing and what’s not working and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. At the end of the session I list out what I did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). 7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? 8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. .Read Me file:After the project I’ll make the read me file. 1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. 2) Features:Detail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. 3) Components:List out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. 4) Closing Statement:Detail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. .It’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. When you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. The notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up A specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. Really helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. Very small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out. It’s only for projects I might show people or a 10 min glance wouldn’t explain what’s going on. Sorry a lot in that comment but that’s how I do it.",

Write down all the pros and cons of the way they are doing things and have that ready for an interview when they ask about things you have learned at previous jobs. Are there other interns there? If so, form a group and discuss these things. Find out if anyone else is struggling and offer to help them.

I started with one other, but they called quits after a few weeks. Looking at git blames and asking other employees, I've found they struggle keeping new devs for more than a couple of months. Some say it's too difficult, probably due to being thrown into the deep end without assistance.There are only 3 seniors, of which one is rarely around, and the other 2 are always busy. I have tried asking for a code review, but he said he didn't have the time. I suppose asking one of the juniors is better than no review at all.You definitely make a point of still being able to leverage this in an interview, and I appreciate that.I really want to try to get docs as mandatory because the designs from one page to another differ, and when going to a project, it takes so long just to try to figure out what is happening. Also, not knowing what is actually supposed to happen becomes an issue. I personally don't really know how to document properly in the first place. Do projects have one large doc or multiple docs",

You have to decide for yourself when to follow them.In this particular case, splitting out repeated code into a common function created a lot of value for you. Not only did it make your code shorter, but if you ever need to modify that logic you only need to do it once.In terms of the name, I think you're focused on describing how it works rather than what it does. It sounds like you have a function that retrieves data and caches it. You could just call it fetchAndCache. Or you could describe in more detail what API it calls and what sort of data it fetches and we could help you come up with a better name.It's not immediately obvious to me that the one function violates SRP. Even though it does multiple steps, if those steps are all related and all necessary for your code, then that may very well be a single responsibility.Furthermore, splitting it up into three separate functions didn't actually help anything. It didn't reduce your total lines of code. It didn't help reusability.That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, just that there's less clear benefit. Don't do it because you think you're \"supposed to\".>So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.I don't think that's what SRP says.Doing three related things that often need to be done together can be a single responsibility.SRP just suggests that if a function is doing multiple \\*unrelated\\* things, try to split them apart. In this case it doesn't sound like they're unrelated.Either way, whenever you follow a principle like DRY or SRP, the end result should make your code better. If it doesn't, then you don't have to apply it in that case.",

So what does this mean exactly; it could be a caution against extracting logic when the information it's working with is very different from other forms of information that might be outbound/inbound to this kind of call. So while having a one-stop function for things like payload validation and Redis caching might sound nice, consider that the language and packages/libraries you're using are already doing that for you, and you adding more function calls as wrappers around those library functions may just be walling off even more utility and making your own code more inflexible",

Because if any of the three changes, it shouldn't affect the other two. So **you are better of with having three separate functions**, requestData, validateData and storeData.And of course you need a fourth function that uses those three, but don't call it something generic like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` \\- use a better abstraction that fits in with what your application uses the data for. Could be `cacheParseTokensLocally()` or `buildNavigationStructure()` or `retrieveCustomerData()`.Naming is the hardest part - but don't think too much of what the function does, think more about where the function is used: what name would make sense to the programmer using it?",

But this one managed to hit a threshold and caused some oncall stuff. When doing some investigation afterwards, I realized it was much worse than I originally thought, and took an entire afternoon to understand why. It was of such complexity, that if it was written by someone who understood the complexity leveraged, it could not have been written. because it is also the epitome of inefficiency. It made exactly the opposite of right choices several times. No junior would have the expertise on our weirdo system to make such unnecessary choices. No lazy eng would have ever gone down the path that presented them with such choices in the first place.I'm thinking we have to fight ai with ai. We can't handle micromanaging user code. The ratio of user to people capable of handling code review is insanely high. We need gatekeepers, and very explicit documentation. potentially lock it down from many degrees of user freedom, and if completely necessary for them to go custom, THEN we do extensive manual reviews.

No internet, certainly no smart phones. And I'm not even 40 yet. That was typical. Think about how insane that is to say nowadays, basically nobody lives that way anymore.The platform I made almost my entire career on didn't exist until I was already in college, I had to pivot after college to learn it. In college I had a flip phone I would text a number to send Tweets to my Twitter account.

Like you I thought finding a job wouldn't be hard, after all I had 4 years of experience at that point and jobs were handed out like candy in '98 when I graduated. I took 3 months off just like you, even spent a good chunk of my severance like an idiot.I spend the next 9 months looking for a job, I was out of work over a year. I ran out of cash, and I was 30-40k in debt on maxed out credit cards. I was borrowing money from friends to make the bills work and out of unemployment checks.My old company (the one that laid me off) called me up, they had an ugly project and were looking for current/ex-employees who had reputations for putting in the hours/work. Wanted to hire me as a contractor, I negotiated an hourly rate, and hopped a plane to chicago, worked remote there for over 9 months, nights/weekends... 80+ hour weeks. That hourly contract rate paid off all my debt, paid back my friends, got me a new car and a nest egg.That contract paid me more in 6-9 month of work then they'd have paid me if they'd just kept me employed during the year I was laid off plus the 6-9 months. It was silly. They hired me back full time to save money.About 8 months later I landed a job in my dream industry and happily walked away from them.Point of my story? It's rough. Being laid off sucks. We can all make mistakes. You may have to do things you don't like to recover. But you can and will recover given enough time. Hang in there. Do what you have to do to make ends meet.Edit: I should add since then I've \"lost my job\" to layoffs several more times in the proceeding years. Though thankfully have had a stable run the last 12-13 or so. I learned my lesson, I keep a large nest egg, try to make sure I have a years worth of bills saved up and accessible.",

My lease expires in two months and my parents live abroad so I’m not sure what happens next, and this was bothering me a lot but after giving myself some space to process it all I think ultimately I’m still remaining hopeful that things will work out.",

I'm a third generation engineer in my family, not to brag, but to say I have first hand experience with stories of different family members having job instability, being pushed out of \"good\" jobs when their skills aren't needed, and having to make lateral moves into project management. I know jobs go away, it's been internalized from a young age when I saw my grandfather use CAD at home, and he explained to me he started as a draftsman. Instead, engineering is a good job for people who like to build things. You can raise a family on the salary, and I still believe that's true. There are benefits, but there's also a good deal of instability in the whole thing.What's really helped me make career in software, is approaching the field like it's a lifelong academic pursuit, and inoculating myself to the stress of layoffs and instability by spending my early career in academia and start ups. I like building things, but I really love learning things. The other perspective, is that the stuff you deride, KPIs, performance reviews, corporate culture, insanity of enterprise from the ground level, it's all worthy of gripes, but it goes a lot easier if you embrace your role and focus exclusively on what you can control.Idk, I'm sorry to hear you are realizing all of this at once. It's not a perfect career, but if you can hack it, there's a lot of benefits.",

It's not worth it to suffer through a semester where you're not learning anything.The good news is that there's no end of supplemental resources you can find for whatever topic you're studying. If you can't understand your professor, it's definitely an unfortunate waste of time to be in lecture, but as long as you know what skills you're supposed to be developing you can get there on your own.Also, some of those professors are better in office hours. I can zone out to the lecture of someone who's hard to understand, but if it's 1:1, they have to go at your pace, so you can have them repeat or rephrase until you're satisfied.",

Don’t make any hasty decisions right now, because those are the ones that will cost you during times like this.If you really feel like your role is in jeopardy, start looking now, and make sure you’re paying careful attention to wherever you’re interviewing. You want to be targeting places that have proven track records of surviving times like this. If the firm is less than 30 years old, it’s probably not a safe bet.Otherwise, the smartest thing you can do is stay put and do everything you can do be indispensable. Put your head down and be a good worker and don’t make yourself a target.It will be okay. This all part of the cycle.",

I assume if people are still filming videos, they're doing it on these days to avoid having people in their videos. On the required in office days, there's a real shortage of space. Meeting rooms are unavailable unless you book them a couple days in advance, offices have been subdivided and subdivided again to fit more desks, 5-10 minute waits for the elevators as you come in, 30 minute waits if you go at peak lunch hours and groups can't find seating together in the main eating areas. This is more crowded than it used to be pre pandemic, since we have the same space but have more than doubled headcount from 2019.Also most full time employees don't use the pool tables, game room, etc. often. If they use the gym, it's before/after work or during lunch. We joke that it's \"intern season\" when we can hear the ping pong table being used and the snacks are gone by lunchtime.",

Those things rely on pure chance. Not necessarily a reason not to build in public or email a CEO or whatever, but these are extreme edge cases.

I know people who have tried the things that shouldn’t have worked but did and got little recognition for it.Back during the CNN craze and vision models, I prototyped a document extraction pipeline that used OCR->NLP that worked. What I didn’t know was this project had stalled for years with people trying vision models and failing. It’s now the standard way for “Intelligent Document Processing.” I was in the camp that CNNs aren’t the right tool for this job and was stubborn lol.Another story from before selling out for tech, I worked in a lab doing organic synthetic methodology. A reaction that should absolutely not work in the presence of water just kind of works if you do it in water. This alone greatly helped my network and opened some doors.Anyways the people I graduated with who are doing the most interesting work were not the type to think outside of the box. Instead they networked, got into the start up scene while having a safety net, had rich parents, and leveraged their parent’s network.Oh and one last thing! The old and long forgotten approaches to problems work and sometimes they work really well. Just no one remembers them because it’s not *hot* or new.",

You could have friends lists and all. Then I thought this would never work because if you were already at a computer you could just log in to AIM.What I didn't know was that I basically invented a form of Twitter and that everybody was going to have a computer in the pocket one day. This this idea made more sense, to me, with smart phones since people are always connected to the internet.And yes I know Twitter was invented with a character limit because the idea was that it were to be used over text messages or something like that.

I'd say from the beginning. CompE grew out of EE as a specialization in the 90s. Every CompE job will hire EE especially if you dump electives in CompE, but not the reverse. None of the EE work I did would interview a CompE. EE degree broadness is its strength. Power plant work? Power always needs EE/ME/ChemE.*But really, the reason EE is better is because of insane CompE overcrowding*. Same problem with CS. [Sort here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major) by unemployment. Factoring in difficulty, CompE probably is the worst degree of all. Where I went, expected time to graduate is 4.0 years for CS, 4.4 for EE and 4.6 for CompE.***I can give specifics. I went to Virginia Tech when CompE enrollment was 3x smaller than EE and the job market looked equally good for both. Not anymore. [Check out](https://web.archive.org/web/20240813115247/https://ece.vt.edu/undergrad/enrollment.html) our degree and enrollment stats. CompE is twice EE's size now and there are not 6x the jobs from 15 years ago.Alumni surveys sent 6 months after graduation show CompE with 15% lower chance of unemployment and way higher graduate school rates (read: didn't find job). CompE job market is competitive as hell and the squeeze is worse if you aren't attending Tier 1.***I'm not saying everyone abandon CompE. If you have to-have to work in hardware then get the specialized hardware degree. Or if you can't handle or hate the ludicrous EE math, very little of which you will likely use IRL. I used 10% of my EE degree. CS is an easier CompE degree. Maybe your internship odds are better with a higher GPA.",

Some of which have little or nothing to do with the other. Some of the fields, like signal processing, control systems, and communication theory, are heavy on advanced mathematics.

This is a field that requires constant learning so if you want to be competitive you cannot stagnate. This is not a great profession to coast bc that will either lead to the learning feeling like a PITA or to you being in a lackluster position which will make future job hunts harder (see 1&2).Personally I was most burnt out working boring jobs with outdated tech that did not have room to grow or stay competitive, even though they were fairly easy and chill.I felt the least burnt out working on interesting projects with modern tech and smart people, even though I was working 10-20 hours more a week than the chill jobs.",

That was not the norm in most careers.Second, LOTS of passion in this industry. Or at least, there was. Any industry that attracts passionate people who love the idea of the work has problems with burnout.Third, it's a type of work that many people find they really put themselves deeply into. You have to defend your ideas, work as part of a team, take ownership. You are seen as an expert, a go to person. You have special knowledge no one else has. All of that further encourages people to go all in.Finally, for a long time the MONEY you could get at the top of the field was insane. But also random. Working harder and making yoru company succeed could be the difference between a nice middle class life and being a billionaire. No doctor is thinking they might be the next Bill Gates if they work just a LIIIITLE bit harder.Huge parts of the industry have no problem with burnout.

Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.The workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.edit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like \"running out of people on the planet to sell to\", and \"2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking\", and \"loans coming due\". Workers are getting squeezed even harder as such.Anyway some drunk stinky german guy figured out all of this in the 1800s in a long winded economic treatise on commodities.",

I don't mess around with WSL on Linux but just go full Linux when needed. But well...

All major operating systems now provide libraries and APIs to build installers. Some of them have multiple installer options. Now I can throw some config options in a CMake file (For C/C++ projects at least) and generate installers for all the major platforms in a way that's fairly straightforward.IIRC there were a lot of third party installers that you could pay for, all throughout the 90's. They promised to build robust installers in a fraction of the time it would take you to build one any other way. There are probably still some old projects on sourceforge that use some proprietary installers. I still try to avoid installing anything from sourceforge due to the persistent rumors that installers from there frequently (always?) bundled malware. Most of the old projects on that site have migrated to more reputable git-based companies to host their source.",

I went 21 months unemployed.Jan 2023 I decided I wanted to start interviewing for Senior roles (yes, at the time 15 YOE and I wasn't senior, long story short - don't hit cruise control). Surprisingly, Sr level interviews felt easy, but I would often get to the final round but never the offer.I could have given up but I was already 15 yrs in. I knew I was good at what I did, I still enjoy it, I just needed to refine my skills. I realized that I actually had a lot of gaps to fill (self-taught). Those gaps spanned anywhere from DSA to not having a command of what i was coding. So I slowly filled those gaps, eventually I gave a solid interview and was made an offer.My thing is, if I wasn't made an offer - maybe the other candidate did just a lil better. Maybe I shouldn't have hesitated on this answer, maybe I shoulda known that thing I shoulda known. I'm able to navigate through these interviews - but its just another candidate with theoretically a similar skillset, that gets to the offer. It's ME that needs to be better. I absolutely cannot imagine starting from scratch in a new area of work. I have twins, 3.5 y/o now. My finances are wrecked. But this is the kind of job and level role that can pay me what I believe I'm worth, so I can eventually dig myself out of that hole. I did a lot of work over that 15ish yrs; I'll be damned if I cant make sense of working through an algo.And so, this is just my situation, I don't know the exact details of yours, but 17 YOE is hard to give up.",

I know people who crashed out at consulting places who are now working in FAANG. Sometimes it depends on what opportunities you get. Sometimes it could be team dynamics. Also, there are times personal life or other factors may be impacting your work.I joined a high-performing team, but my personality is pretty laid back. There was always someone more familiar with the code (they wrote it). It wasn’t until they all moved to other projects, and I was given an opportunity that I got a lot better. I was more responsible for success or failure. When I had originally joined the team, I spent more time reading about World of Warcraft than improving myself. So, you can definitely become a stronger developer, but you have to make the effort. I do believe there are those with more innate talent, but there are plenty of cases of people wasting opportunities. Also, take what some of these people say with a grain of salt. Some of them are preoccupied with building their branding and misrepresent a lot of stuff. Be wary whenever money, fame, and recognition are involved.

It says to me that this particular manager is disinterested in (and philosophically prevented from) supporting their team members' growth and career development. At the same time, the risk of thinking of these tiers as mostly static also leads to the opposite problem: believing you have an \"A Player\" because of their history and not identifying when they have struggles.Of course... maybe I'm over thinking it. If \"natural ability\" is malleable then it really just means \"knowing things\". That said, yes, literally everyone has gone from someone who causes more problems than they fix to someone who fixes more problems than they cause. I am a far, far better engineer than I was at the beginning of my career. If you are feeling like a big screw up now, do not despair and spiral... put in the work, put your ego aside to ask for help and get better at the job.",

I didn't work overtime and I pushed back a lot on unreasonable deadlines. So it wasn't that I was kissing ass or anything like that.It came down to that I could be given tasks and I was trusted to deliver. I would take the time to really understand what was needed and made sure to think of all the issues. Other SWEs would just implement what they were told to do and often there would be corner cases that were missed.I was and \"A player\" at these companies, but I know I am a slow coder at the end of the day. It takes my brain a while to wrap it's head around a task and understand what really needs to be done. I'm never going to wow anybody in an interview setting.Saying all that I assume I would be a B or even C player at a real tech company.

When I was in university, throughout the 3 years we had multiple instances where we had to build projects from scratch. I remember that at one seminar we were given a list of 30 ideas for projects, with no requirements at all, things like:* \"4-way chess game\"* \"Musical composer\"* \"File browser and manager\"* etc.and it was up to us to come up with our own requirements and build something. Some of these projects were group work too, so that made it easier as you had other peers to brainstorm with.That said, I wouldn't worry too much. Job interviews for juniors don't usually have you build a whole project from scratch, and when you join a company you will be supervised and given a lot of structure. I would suggest joining a more established company rather than an early startup, because they would offer the structure, the product and technical requirements, and you will be given ample support and guidance (ideally).At the interview for my first job they had me write a small function to determine whether a given string was a palindrome (i.e. a word that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as \"madam\" or \"racecar\"). That was it for the technical test.",

Then do this a couple of times again.I have been coding for roughly 20 years, professionally for 10: I still use both google and AI every day, before chatgpt I used stackoverflow :D It's just how it is: you find new tech, new libs so you need to learn to integrate them to your stack and many times it's not intuitive at all.

        "body": "Sounds like you are just sitting in but I have advice for leading interviews as I have interviewed hundreds of people and have a pretty good track record at my company as a quality interviewer:1. Don't bother finding out what they don't know, and let them know this say its okay to not know something. Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. 3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. 5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates. At the end of your interview (assuming your company has good hiring practices) you should be able to fill in these blanks about every candidate:I would/n't hire this person.If we did hire them these are my concerns __________ .If we did hire them here is where I think they would excel ________.",

The questions go from generically about the tech/stack they used to more specific questions about implementation details. Having rarely interviewed the perfect experience fit, I like to ask as much about their work as their familiarity with our tools to gauge how thoughtful they are as a developer. I think the equivalent of white boarding for UI work is asking to pseudo code a rudimentary application that paginates streams of data or an account creation client app. If you aren't the sole interviewer, take note of what others are asking and try to overlap with the other interviewers are trying to pique.",

Ask about a project they worked on if it's listed on their resume. My favorite is to show them something that needs fixing and let them talk you through how they'd fix it. Nothing too complex, but something with obvious errors that a suitable candidate should find.

But it's unlikely to be one that ends in you getting promoted into a leadership role.Few organizations with any sense are going to \"gamble\" on that sort of transition. As a manager/staff+ person your ability to affect the organization increases significantly. That has as much potential to skyrocket the value you provide as it does for you to completely crater important initiatives and entire teams. Organizational leadership will want to see that you are capable before officially putting you into a role with more responsibility. In this case, your best option to move upwards is to find a new job and tell very convincing tales during interviews.Your manager is telling you: They think you have what it takes, and want you to show some initiative.> Obviously I want to continue getting raises, but I'm reaching that mid-high experience point where I become leadership or become a slacker.I can't speak for every org, but mine loves our \"super seniors\" -- ones who aren't quite staff+/management, and have no desire to be, and are happy to continue owning major feature-sets and mentoring newer engineers, and are happy to sit at the tippy-top of that Senior Engineer pay band in perpetuity. There's value in people who are exceptionally good at the \"chop wood, carry water\" work, and who have an inclination to do it. The top of our Senior Engineer pay band is still like 2x the median household income for the broader area we employ from, and we remain competitive with other employers in this area. Sure those salaries are less than a management/staff+ salary, but our Senior Engineers are very far from starving.> How have you all handled this transition?Personally, I was doing all the \"leadership\" stuff before the thought of moving into management had ever occurred to me. As much was reflected in an offer I received to be a staff+ member of a big-name DevOps/SRE consultancy. This offer came roughly at the same time I was offered a management role with my current organization. I stuck around to feel the \"people management\" stuff out a bit, enjoyed it plenty, and did that for ~5 years before moving more into a product focused role.",

For example, if there is a gap in documentation for a process, and everyone is always coming to you for help, write up an SOP and publish it on the team wiki.Find ways to improve the workflow and improve morale on the team. Listen to your coworkers and think about their pain points, then think of how you can design new workflows or mechanisms to address the team’s issues. Take them to your manager and discuss them.

Your manager needs to get it approved by the org / their managers etc. They can’t just say “I believe x could operate at the next level so we should promote”.You need to display you’re operating at the next level already then your manager can say “x has been doin a, b, c which are responsibilities at the next level, we need to promote and align their title with their responsibilities”You come off as quite naive tbh. This is how the game works. Don’t like it? Then stay at your current level. Bc if you don’t step up someone else will and get that promo. Promotions are competitive and political.Also your manager is giving this to you basically on a silver platter my god. They’ve already identified YOU as a leader and they’re telling you to step up then they can promote you. They’re helping and pushing you yet you’re ignoring it. At the end of the day it’s up to you to seek out, identify, and execute on opportunities. Don’t want it? Fine. But don’t expect career growth.",

It's much easier if you can find a tangential justification relating to your actual work.For example at work recently I had a task relating to our UI deployments for a smallish internal tool (needed to increase some version number for security reasons). I could've just quickly box-checked the task and closed the ticket but instead I dug about to understand the whole CICD pipeline and why the dependency even existed. I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.I spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.My point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend. I solved the version issue by just adopting a simpler deployment approach but I learnt along the way and got kudos from our engineering lead for improving a process.",

There are also people who literally do not care. Having worked with some hiring teams, there are devs who care more about their work deliverables than interviews. It's possible the feedback you received is valid, it's also possible it's wrong. That being said, I'm not sure you should be so sure you submitted what they were looking for. I worked at a place that intentionally left take-home assignments vague, because they wanted people to impress them. One person made a solution that technically did what was asked, and my assumption is they knew what they were doing, but the submission was so non-standard, we ended up rejecting them and wasting everyone's time. I think you just need to realize hiring is an imperfect process, and some company passing on you isn't necessarily an accurate assessment of your ability to do the work. You have to just forget those who passed on you and keep looking for a job that will fit. Also, don't assume people are spending a lot of time doing a really personalized candidate tracking process. They probably just clicked a \"reject\" button in some candidate tracking software, and you got an automated message.

This was a lame ass startup with 1mil funding. So this is how it reflects on me. For my local market, my profile is strong. This should be a walk in the park for me. I do think there's factors like budget which are not standard here, but ultimately it's what you said. It's an imperfect process and especially a very fresh team won't really know what they're looking for so that's that.",

There was a compiled DBase III (Which Foxbase was based on) language called Clipper. My first job included some Clipper development in a MSDOS environment. In that same position I found that OS/2 and a third party multitasking DOS (which I think was built by the same guys who did Dr Dos) called DRM Dos were able to run the Clipper applications. The closest thing my company had to a \"Server\" application was a restaurant reservation application that I developed that ran on multiple terminals hanging off a 386 running Drm Dos.The oldest thing I've run across since then was a Motif application that a Satellite company was maintaining (*Edit:* This was in 2015). The oldest comments were from the mid 90's and some of the functions still used K&R function declaration syntax. I'd actually experimented with Motif while I was working at my first job, so I had bit of an advantage there.Their code actually generated three executables and shared a header file which declared 400+ global variables -- ALL the variables used in the application, pretty much. There were multiple places where global variables were mirrored -- another variable was created that duplicated the intent of an earlier variable. I was unable to determine if this was because they forgot the other variable existed or they weren't sure they could change the variable safely because some other function might need it set to a specific value at some later point. Probably a bit of both. This meant that you'd have to find the variable that was shared between the various functions of the code you were working on right now and insure that you were changing the right mirrored variable. You'd also have to hope that those changes wouldn't break some other functionality of the application. And yes, that was every bit as bad as it sounds.I went in with a philosophy of never adding another global variable to the code unless it resulted in the removal of at least two others. They were unwilling to do anything major with the code and everyone in that building got laid off a bit later, before I had a chance to really get it under control. Hopefully that entire code base was simply deleted after that. That abomination should not have been allowed to continue past that point.I'd say I'd seen worse code over the years, but only a couple of other cases I can think of where I'd actually define the code as \"an abomination.\" All the code that I would describe as \"an abomination\" was developed by developers who clearly didn't know what they were doing in the least, because \"Global variables bad\" was something they were already teaching in college in the early and mid 80's. I wasn't in college in the early 80's, but I had books from that time.",

What one company considers a Junior SWE, another company might consider them a Senior SWE.My new grad company for example tossed the \"Senior\" word at people after 2 YOE. Does that mean those people are suddenly Senior industry-wide? Obviously not. That was just that single company's title hierarchy.Compare that to the next company I joined, which wouldn't consider calling anybody \"Senior\" until at least 7-8 YOE.The roles themselves can differ too. At some companies a Staff SWE is just a regular IC with a lot of experience, and churns out code on a single team like everyone else. At other companies, a Staff SWE is much closer to management than it is SWE. At other companies still, a Staff SWE serves as an architect role and is working across several dev teams providing technical leadership. So just because Company A called you a \"Staff SWE\", doesn't mean you meet the expectations of what Company B has for a Staff SWE.Every company has their own hierarchy, with their own expecations. Downlevels, and *uplevels*, are just the company mapping you onto their hierarchy.",

My teammate came in senior from another big tech company, and was hired as mid. Looking at our interview system with an internal view, it's designed to take \"below\" \"at\" or \"above\" level feedback. So you might get tracked at \"mid\" for the cycle, but an upward departure in some candidates is planned for. That's just what it takes to make senior.it's not really about YOE (at least not for my job), but about the roles you've played on teams , your responsibility, and track record of technical execution. For instance, I was at a scale up database startup, filled with ex-Meta engineers, but I was still rejected at one big tech company over: \"lack of technical leadership for long term projects\". I was a tech lead, but I just hadn't lead a team on a project that lasted long enough. Fair call.I ended up going to a better company and getting that experience, so I believe that was a false negative. I don't blame them, in this job market you hire for the skills people have, not rely on personal growth to meet your business needs, and the rest is just extra. This is a lot different than the market in 2015 when I built a career off \"good experience, smart learner, grow into it\", but that's just the way it goes in a down market.",

The scope of work at many nontech firms just aren't there... and the truth is tech companies are well aware of relative scope of each levels and nontech firms at this point (there's just so much internal datapoints anyway for you to bs).>How bout in the case of bigger tech startup/lesser known tech companies with relatively high tc or name valueDepends on the company.Though to be honest outside the AI agent grift startups, the ones that pay comparably are most likely similar (as they are well known firms).Stripe, Figma, Databricks, TikTok, MongoDb, DataDog, etc are seen no different. They are FAANG equivalents. And honestly, many of them are flat out more selective and wanted than much of FAANG.I guess you are talking about firms like Anduril, Neuralink, Sentry, Discord, StubHub, Brex, Rippling, Scale AI, Cohere, Nuro, Plaid, Vanta, Glean, AirTable, Flexport, Retool, Verkada, Perplexity, Cadence, Mercor, Zip, Bilt, Ramp, Notion, OpenSea, Instacart, etc? Depends on what you did at those firms.Much of those firms are filled with ex-FAANG engineers and many of them are well known for top talent. And because those firms tend to offer 'top range total compensation' (if you believe in the valuation), tech companies take them as peers. I know no one here is going to say this explicitly here but TC (compensation) is levels as well.It's why Netflix engineers pre-covid had no issues moving around other tech firms despite only having 1 level aka \"Senior Engineer\". Pay is a serious leverage for getting the level you want.>Like if you have whatever yoes required to be Senior at Faang(let’s say 7) from lesser known tech companies, will your yoe be considered less and ineligible to get the role?A senior at most of the firms I listed will have no problems getting senior at FAANG.But a 'senior' at a nontech firm like Home Depot/JPM Chase/Capital One/etc realistically ain't getting senior at FAANG.This is also because tech firms tend to have rubrics for what is expected at each level. Those standards tend to be higher at known tech firms so naturally if you stay at those firms for a while... you will have all the requirements to be senior at FAANG. Of course once you get to senior staff and up... you really need to work at large tech firms because that kind of impact isn't exactly there consistently at most firms.",

The big defense primes (Lockheed, RTX, NG) are actually huge proponents of agile and have teams dedicated to teaching others agile as well as pushing for certification for product owners and scrum masters (it depends on the org. These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). Baked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. Built in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. So yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level. We have integration, system, and end-to-end tests with real hardware in a lab. There are projects that try to redo an entire existing system, but they tend to be wasteful and expensive.",

The goal of refactoring is to make the system easier to extend, update, and understand.When you have a brittle system, actual feature changes are significantly more likely to break production.When you have a difficult to extend system, seemingly simple feature changes can take months (or years!) to complete, costing the company tons of money and time.When you have a difficult to understand system, your employees because a single point of failure. When one person leaves the company, now you have to find their replacement or else the project timeline gets delayed by several more months. But when the system itself is cryptic and difficult to understand/modify, it takes significantly more time to onboard a new employee, easily resulting in a year+ of lost productivity. That high onboard cost can often get teams into a situation where *all* their developers leave, and now you have a fresh team of people that don't understand the codebase. This is how \"black boxes\" get created, by not refactoring combined with turnover.All this kinda plays into retention, which exacerbates everything. A complex, brittle, difficult to work with, system is *not* pleasant to work on. If management has no interest in letting the SWE's improve that system, then those SWE's won't be staying at that company for very long. High turnover introduces new developers, who are significantly more likely to break prod, while also having a very long and expensive onboarding process.So yeah, in critical areas, you *need* to refactor. The costs of not doing it aren't always immediate, but it's significantly more dangerous than not refactoring at all. Any halfway competent engineering manager will be going to bat for their SWE's to refactor against product and upper management. This is the balance of a healthy SWE team. Product is pushing for features, upper management is pushing for results/money, engineering management is pushing for a stable/maintainable/extendable codebase. If either of those 3 prongs get an inordinate say, you're on a toxic team.That said, there are very well defined approaches to refactoring a legacy codebase. Writing a massive PR with +10000/-12000 isn't the way to do it. That's a high risk PR whether it's a refactor or a new feature. Refactors can be done in small chunks, and done using common design patterns that reduce risk.",

The navy wont really help much in that regard. Idk any software dev that takes government/military job for its tech lmao",

LOLYou are in the position half the military signs up with the military to get into after the military pays for their education and job training.The thing missing in your life is not the military. You absolutely would be insane to spend 4-6 years of your life enlisted in the military. What you are missing is *purpose and direction*. And yes, you could get that in the military. But you don't need the military to get it. Some people join the military and get the exact opposite, and then spend years feeling purposeless and directionless.Up to now, everything you've been doing was to get to here. Every class and school project, hobby project, leetcode grind. All to get an education, good job, stable income, and financial freedom. A lot of that was your purpose and the directions were clear from your parents, from your teachers, and to some degree hiring managers.You have all of that now, but no idea what to do with yourself now that you do. It is time to discover who you are and what you want to be... you were supposed to do that in college, but STEM majors never have the time to do self-discovery, LOL.Browse countries and experiences that you'd like to go do and experience. Find youth development programs you might want to volunteer for/at/with.See if there are personal projects you want to work on that are purely your personal project, having nothing to do with work or getting a new job or improving your skills to achieve some career milestone nor to make money with. A purely, \"I do this thing because I like doing it, and it brings me meaning and purpose.\"*Live your life with purpose and direction*—what that means is up to YOU to figure out now.",

But I joined in high school and 3 weeks after graduation I was in boot camp because I had no plan for my life. It’s hard to explain but my advice, whatever it’s worth, is to keep your job and work your way up the economic ladder. Even if you went in as an officer, you’re losing 85-90% of your paycheck. If I were you, I would stay and keep working because the money you can and will make will provide the travel and fun experiences you desire. Sure they won’t be exactly the same as creating some relationships, however, not all relationships in the military are good. You will have corrupt seniors harm your promotions if you don’t play by their rules, you’ll go places and do jobs you absolutely hate doing. That’s why I say it’s better to be financially independent and choose what experiences you want rather than maybe experience them by chance. I never got the chance to go to Russia or Australia and those countries were the stuff of legends. But you can go there now where you’re already at. I feel like I keep saying the same thing differently, but I guess that’s my point. You don’t need to join the military to have experiences someone else got to have when you can make those experiences with the money and freedom you possess right now. If you want to feel like you’ve contributed to the welfare of the country then I would recommend you get hired at a tech company that fulfills that wish. Best wishes on your decision and your future young man.",

You can get an employer to pay for it or if you’re lucky the school will pay for it (I had the school pay for both, and option 1 seems off the table for you considering your circumstances). A few things about a masters, it absolutely can help you get a job if you’re struggling to get one now. However, you need to have a complete mental shift if you decide to get a masters. A masters will be entirely worthless if you view it as just more school. You should treat it like a job which means you should take the hard classes intentionally, if you look for easy A’s you’re wasting your time and money. You should also get involved in graduate research (this is also how you might be able to get the school to pay for your degree + a monthly stipend). Doing research is free experience that can help you land an internship and/or a job. Talking about my graduate research during an interview is probably how I got my first job. This means you need to go to a graduate school that is a notable research institution. Also note that Trump has gutted NSF funding so some PhD programs are not even fully sponsored now and they will certainly get sponsorship priority over a grad student. I can answer more questions if you have any but if you wasted your undergrad you’re probably going to have a hard time getting into a worthwhile graduate program and even harder time getting it paid for. You might be able to reach out to an old professor and offer free research labor and maybe work your way into getting them to sponsor you eventually or at least see if you have what it takes to do a masters while getting at least something resembling real experience",

You can connect with people in your desired positions at desired companies and ask them about their journey and overall advice about skills to build, projects to work on or even advice on your resume. When reaching out, it is important not to act entitled to a referral, best to frame it around improving yourself to stand out. This has led to great advice and some referrals. Always be open to redoing your resume, work on new projects to pick up skills and get certificates. Apart from that, remain open to less ideal locations, if it’s a good career stepping stone.",

Then the iPhone came out and changed literally everything for like at least a decade. Since 2016-ish, it kind of feels like all tech has gone back to hype scams: crypto, NFTs, AI, metaverse... we're back to pre-dot-com bubble imoSo if this bubble bursts HARD then I think it will create a void where only people who are in programming for the love of the game are gonna stick around",

My manager was mad, my lead was mad, leadership was mad, I honestly thought they’d fire me. Eventually I found a frontend role on another team within the company, and they let me switch (but they were pretty pissed lol), but it was pure luck and I was okay if they ended up firing me on the spot...Then it happened again because I wanted to do backend or at least full stack work. So I started telling my manager I could handle and i know backend too. For a few months, I worked 11–12 hours a day, but told my manager that i finshed my tasks in 6 hours lol, and then asked for backend tasks. Slowly, they let me help on a Spring Boot app, then Django, and eventually they trusted me to do backend and fullstack work...So yeah… I guess you need to make it super clear to your manager, like every other meeting, what your career goal is (to become a dev). Don’t let them forget.And if you’re not planning to just straight up tell them no, then you’ll have to do the IT work for now...because a job is a job...but still keep asking for dev work whenever you can (and continuing looking for outside opportunities)",

Nobody would touch me without a degree. I went and got a degree circa 2017 and I can say unequivocally that college is not an educational institution, it's a licensing gauntlet. You're bouncing from ego to ego of the full time teaching staff that have never been in the private sector, but are charged in preparing you for it. I wrote essays on the \"Browser Wars,\" traced some algorithms, tried out some new programming languages, but NOTHING from college prepared me better for my fulltime career. I actually did a bootcamp for the time that I had my degree, yoe and still couldn't get interviews because my history was in legacy systems (COBOL + Mainframe). So everyone reading those COBOL developers are drowning in offers, just know that's a very hurtful clickbait lol. But the bootcamp gave me a full stack experience that tripled anything of value from college, since we used a template of Flask. That bootcamp gave me 90% of my modern view of development work. I started working personal projects until I got hired to do API work. There's nothing of any value from my undergrad degree. I answer these because I'm a contrast for some of your worldview. I experienced it in the weird oddball way that OP highlighted. I broke into the career, then got my degree, then continued my career. Calc 2 and 3 didn't make me a better developer, it made me better at test taking and studying. Data Structures and Algorithms were already known, but I didn't know what was available in modern and other languages from COBOL. I was working in procedural languages, so I got an OOP lesson, which was neat, and I probably had the best OOP professor who added in how he uses it practically which is what many of my classes taught by academics were missing. My electives were taught by academics and did not help me apply much of my core studies. A bioninformatics class had given me hope, but the teacher just read from the book and power points and we had a 3-4 week intro to what bioinformatics is and the tools used before getting our hands on anything. My DevOps class opened where the professor asked us \"What is DevOps,\" and started taking notes and building that syllabus on the first day. We didn't touch git until our software engineering final group project and most of the class couldn't figure it out. I solemnly promise that I did not need to get a bachelor's degree and am now Senior level in my shop. The classes were full of old material taught identically for over a decade. The math just simply didn't coincide with computer science lessons, like I've heard some have. It was hard, It was messy. But luckily I experienced that prior to learning how to code for the military and already had a prideful ego. I think everyone needs to get discipline and experience hard/dark times to really push themselves. But academically at a mid-tier state school, I did not become better for it.",

However, at least for the frontend, you can use something called sharepoint framework which lets you use React and Typescript in place of power apps.

Better situation is to be a technically weaker guy, moving in with people who are technically strong, but who see your potential, and want to bring you along. Things to think about. Think about how your job search is going, if you see other prospects. Think about whether it’s a long term or short term opportunity for you. If you left in six months or a year, would you leave on good terms, with marketable skills? If it involves a physical move, would you be moving to a market where you’d have more opportunities?

I might because the interview place is in a small town that you can't even fly into. You have to fly into a nearby bigger city. For example, think flying into Atlanta to go to a small town in Alabama like Auburn (went to school there so have experience in situations like this). So I most likely will need a car to get from the airport to the hotel. They do say there's a shuttle. So I could take that, but since it's a small town I'm worried about relying on Uber/Lyft if they're scarce. They said they'd cover that too so it may add up anyway.",

You finished two years and you got two more to go, it's either you finish now or you leave and potentially never finish later. I struggled hard in school and now I have been working in the industry for 5 years. You're not mentally ill dude, stop letting this world gas light you into thinking something is wrong with you. You're stressed out because school is stressful, that's normal.If you're struggling seek tutoring, spent time after class talking with your instructors, see if you can learn things from your classmates as well. Go to bed early, hit the gym, stop eating junk and doing drugs or drinking if you do that a lot. You just giving up and shutting down when life gets hard is not going to help yourself in the long run, nor is it going to help you if you ever make it into the field.",

First off, it’s completely valid to feel drained and frustrated; you’re juggling a lot, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as academics.From my experience, a degree DOES help open doors, especially early in tech, but it’s not the only path. Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.If you enjoy programming, it’s worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.Honestly, there’s no perfect answer. Try weighing what will keep you motivated and learning while protecting your well-being. Even switching to a more flexible path can get you where you want without feeling trapped or behind.You’re not “less than” anyone without a degree, what matters is what you DO with your skills and opportunities.",

I also have high profile references.There's two ways to look at this:1) Your interview went generally well but the company could not pay you the salary you wanted or maybe they filled headcount and decided to move with another candidate.2) It did not go as well as you think. Take time to reflect on the answers to questions AND how you came across as. I've been in interview debriefs where we had a technically great candidate, but the person's soft skills were awful. In my interview, I was constantly interrupted, told me I was wrong, told me that they didn't care about getting the job because their current job was better, etc. The conclusion was \"this person is technically smart, but I wouldn't want to work with this person\" and so we passed on the candidate.If you're working for 7+ years then you have more than enough opportunities to show why you're a senior dev. Talk about projects you led, mentorship opportunities, etc. Be kind. Literally be someone you would want to work with.",

My last company did a reverse-version of this for every manager role. “Promote the internal person, with 5+ yoe, already doing the managerial work, to the role? Nah let’s hire some random external person because they already have manager in their title… then we get the internal to train them for 6+ months”.",

Your friend isn't going to just be able to teach themselves for a few months and stumble into a job. They'll likely need to go back to school to get a CS degree. Even then, it's not a guarantee they'll break in.If they do break in, the things your friend seems to not like about medicine exist in this industry as well. Tech is a capitalist's dream. Private equity firms acquire, and milk companies for all they're worth. Upper management will milk their developers to make a buck.WLB isn't a guarantee in this industry either. Many companies have expectations that their SWE's work 60+ hour weeks. Some teams have extremely toxic cultures, and may even restrict you from taking PTO.Working from home also certainly isn't a guarantee in this industry. More and more companies are going back to a hybrid model now that the pandemic is a distant memory. Some companies have even gone back to 100% onsite. The fully remote companies have become more rare, and competitive as a result.Sure there are good jobs, with good WLBs, with good management, that are fully remote.... but they're not guaranteed. It's entirely possible if your friend goes through all the work to break into this industry, they end up at a toxic company that has them just as miserable as they seem to be in medicine.Lastly, is your friend's issue with medicine as a whole? Or their current gig? People seem to immediately jump to the extreme option of abandoning a career the moment they don't like something. Instead, why doesn't your friend focus on staying in the career they're already in, but find a job that they won't be miserable in? Surely they're out there.",

If your friend has been financially wise and invested well (for me this would be something like 1mil in retirement accounts in my early 40s) and is looking for a more relaxed role to simply coast to retirement, then this isn't necessarily a terrible idea. That is, with the big caveat that he is willing to humble himself starting with an entry level data analyst or health informaticist role at a health network paying ~60k. The average doctor I have worked with would be completely unwilling to take an entry level role like that on social grounds alone, even putting aside the money. There are obviously still roles in the 100k+ range, but I wouldn't bank on that in this market unless his previous roles included significant clinical quality oversight, health informatics or anything health IT related. If he thinks 60k/yr would be worth it in exchange for 3 days in office and 40 hour workweeks he should consider it.",

It lacks structure, has inconsistent code quality, minimal error handling, and an unresponsive, buggy UI. It feels like it was built without clear architecture or professional standards. The codebase is massive, so theres only so much I can do about this.And man, I totally get what you mean... we’re also using a modern stack, but the software engineering practices are also a mess...> At my company, getting a master's degree leads to a promotion quicker from L2 to L3, and I am thinking if I get a master's degree, especially in the AI/ML space, it will help me in the future when it comes to my career and opening up more jobs. However, doing this will keep me stuck at the company for several years and I won't be able to leave until 1 year after I have obtained the degree.I actually had the same thought you did and decided to go for an MSCS with an AI specialization. I’m over halfway done now, and honestly, I do feel kind of stuck. Not bc I have to stay for the tuition payback or anything (it’s cheap enough that I wouldn’t care if they wanted it back), but bc I’ve gotten used to this job now as working from home makes it super easy to balance work, life, and school. So even though I think about switching jobs almost every day, I haven’t actually applied anywhere. I just want to finish my MS first and then move on. And this job gives me the best balance for now since the school workload is kind of insane, and I don’t think I could handle it without having a WFH job.So...if you’re thinking about doing it, I’d say give it a shot, but just underatand it’s a huge time sink that sometimes I still wonder if I’d be better off just grinding LC and prepping for interviews instead of doing this MSCS... But I do know defense companies and the government are some of the few places that actually value master’s degrees. So i guess if you want to stay in this sector then definitely give it a try. I guess just pick an affordable one, like GaTech or UT Austin, so if you ever decide to leave, you can just pay for it yourself without stressing over it.",
