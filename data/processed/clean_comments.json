        "body": "Let me focus on data products. I have a data engineering background, and yes, these terms often get thrown into the buzzword bucket.But I actually like thinking in data products. A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess :man_facepalming:). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.Up until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, \"What are your data products?\", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.While software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.Technically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.From a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.From a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.However, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).Look at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.**Basically: When they work, they're invisible. When they break, everyone notices.**",

For example, unknown schema version, or jsonschema rejects your data.",

So you aren't missing a lot.What you can do is try to set an example. Pick a manageable subset of the data. Document it. Tag it. Whatever. Throw an LLM at the docs and ask some basic stuff.

It was a constant clown car fire drill and the data processes suffered greatly as a result. I started plopping down SQL server/ssis everywhere, because I can fix whatever your problem is in a few days and you can take however long it is you need to build out XYZ and you have a control system you can run in parallel with and when you can demonstrate that you can reliability replicate my numbers, we can migrate over. Over time a lot of these initiatives died off because it became harder and harder to justify the man months spent reinventing the wheel and these comically large cloud bills for really simple tasks.I'm sure that's an unpopular opinion, I like cool tech too, but I just want something I can trust to work and move on with my life.",

What you're describing sounds typical, maybe even kinda good? Don't expect to find a job where you are free from dipshit architecture and handed up to date documentation of your data assets in day 1, maybe those roles exist somewhere but I haven't seen them.If you think in terms of business value, I'm wondering if your org's move to the cloud was a bright idea. If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go. But dipshit architects with a vendor in their ear are far from rare, anywhere you go.It feels universally accepted that if you're on prem you're not a real DE and execs and architects believe it's a fundamental truth that the cloud will unlock value. In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.Maybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE. Today you've got big problems to solve and lots of business value to unlock, a management structure above you that's floundering and will think you're a wizard if you help them by implementing some common sense basics, and a pretty typical set of issues that will be familiar in any role.",

I don’t think I’ve really heard of going to HR because an individual wasn’t happy with their review. Depending on the size of the company and your relationship with them, talking to your boss’s boss is an option but could backfire if you don’t already have a working relationship there. Having been on both sides, depending on how frequently you’re trying to get clarification/how it’s being done I could potentially understand the manager’s side. I’ve had employees who seem to reach out with questions whenever there’s any kind of decision that needs to be made or they run into any kind of roadblock, rather than trying to figure it out themselves first, and it can be draining when it ends up being a regular interruption. Ideally a manager wants to be able to point you in the right direction, answer your questions up front, and then generally let you do your thing. I think it’s also worth acknowledging the difference between effort and results. If I have an engineer who is “lazy” but gets things done without issue or automates things to make their job easier, and another that is always working hard but seems to struggle a lot, I’ll take the lazy one every time. Not trying to doubt what you’re saying or anything, just some things to consider. All of that said, if you think your review did not reflect your actual performance, and the company doesn’t value you, then absolutely find a job somewhere that does value your talents. It can also be the case that your manager is incompetent or a jerk, and there’s no obligation to stick around.",

So you make your API call, then cut down what it returns to you to only keep the parts you need. You then take the result of that and load it into your warehouse. That's ETL since you didn't keep the source data in its raw form; you applied a transformation first.On the other hand, if you take the API response and store the ENTIRE THING into your warehouse, then build a table that selects from it to get the fields you actually need, that's ELT.",

It targets a different part of the workflow (complementary). It is a single 15MB static binary that runs anywhere, even where Python is not available. It requires zero setup, zero dependencies, and zero configuration. TinyETL excels at fast extract and load operations for ad-hoc data migrations, conversions, and inspections. Python is still the best tool for complex transformations, but TinyETL is about moving and validating data quickly and frictionlessly without needing a full environment.That’s my current vision at least. I just implemented DuckBD connector so this opens the door for a more powerful sql transformation layer in a future release.",

For a while I've been able to weight the proportion towards admin/engineering/come-architecture work because of some team changes around me, and seniority, I guess.Back to the blurry line, though. If a data engineer \"does pipelines\"... WTF even is a \"pipeline\"? Isn't it just input to output? What's the output of a data engineer? Varies wildly, I'd say. Probably also very dependent on team makeup, like mine. If output is data at a cleaned/\"silver\" state where an \"analyst\" or \"modeller\" comes in to then make it star schema or something else: well, for me in my place, that's not worth much. 50% value kind of thing. Good for the self service analyst who wants to just get it into Excel. Maybe you don't want to build enterprise reports with it, though, for example.So, if a \"data engineer does pipelines\" is part of the definition of an engineer, and that pipeline involves extracting data from an SQL server or an API feed into some kind of staging area in a warehouse or data lake.... I repeat my thinking, that's half the job at best, and worth that much. In that case we would do some general analysis of the raw/source data; set up some options in config/metadata; set up the automation; and that's kind of that bit done. The rest is *analysis*, *modelling*.So, I guess I do arguably quite a lot of analyst work as an engineer. Sorry for the waffle.",

I’m still technically a full stack engineer so still do a bit of everything. I do work with end users, but we’re in consulting so I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily working with analysts.

I started my career in IT doing report development/process automation/light design work in a Kimball Data Warehouse environment, then moved into corporate finance doing data standardization/automation/data warehouse to financial ledger reconciliation before moving into analytics engineering. I'm twenty-ish years into my career in data.I do a lot of work with data engineers who are usually upstream of my work and BI developers who are usually downstream of it, as well as business management. I had more responsibility for data modeling earlier on, but that's becoming something that Data Architects work on more lately. You're responsible for dealing with quality issues, but that's often a collaborative effort with upstream processes/systems.Required skills: Business acumen, excellent soft/people skills, data modeling and engineering experience, documentation/technical writing, ETL/ELT development, advanced SQL knowledge, attention to detail, problem solving.",

Nowadays everything is on cloud (is trending and hype) so all those ETL were transformed into pipelines but the idea is the same, transform data and have a bit of tabular sense. I saw that models as Kimball stayed on the DW phase while now DataLakes are more unstructured considering data model perspective. I think nowadays python skills is primary for data engineers, SQL probably for the visualization side (depends on which technology)",

Business wants you to say ‘yes this is accurate’, then shit on you if they find something they deem inaccurate, it’s typical cover-your-ass where words like ‘accountable’ get thrown around - things can get spicy, but rarely get better. First Come up with a definition of what must be in place for you to ‘trust’ a data source - eg minimum 100 randomly sampled days over a 3 year timeline showing 0% variance from your ‘source of truth’ reports, maybe you need monitoring, referential integrity testing etc - whatever you think you would need to be able to say to them ‘yes, based on our definition of accurate, this is accurate’. Once you have that list, make a spreadsheet that lists sources, and which boxes on your ‘trust checklist’ they meet or not. This should be something you personally believe vs a list off the internet IMO as you need to adapt it to your businesses goals / quality thresholds. Depending on how familiar you are with the data sources, prioritize that list and have a discussion with management about why/what needs to get implemented. If they deny it, every time something wrong gets caught in production, make a note on that list of which data sources had problems because a feature in your checklist wasn’t implemented. This makes things less emotional/loose and more working in quantifiable/tangible steps towards achievable goals - you do just have to hold the line on the pressure thing, keep discussions very black and white & honest about timelines business can expect - don’t fall into the trap of grossly underestimating just to keep them happy, those timeline bills come due eventually.

We also owned compute resources for a QuickSight account with a few hundred daily users. Maybe 100 dashboards if I had to guess and a shitload of SPICE memory. Also producing like 15,000 daily csv reports with Lambda and Glue. Many glue crawlers running to maintain our data lake in S3. We went on a campaign to downsize our cluster and delete unused resources recently so I think we were spending more like $150k at one point. Also did a better job flagging and killing bad queries that hogged up our resources. Then forcing everyone to do code reviews to standardize best practices. It’s pretty amazing how many people write bad code lol. I helped fix all that improving the performance of sr engineers and here I am 8 months unemployed can’t get a single job offer.",

It's better if you use a combination of standard approaches (column level masking with policy tags, row level access controls, authorised views) in my opinion.You _can_ use custom masking routines in your column level security. This involves creating a UDF that operates on the column and decides how to mask it. To make this work, you need to insert suitable info into the column, so you'd need to do something a bit hacky:1. create a column in an upstream layer indicating whether a row's ID is present in your list of those-to-be-masked2. prepend some identifier to the column of interest if it's in a row that needs masking```SELECT CONCAT( IF(to_be_masked, 'MASKME::', ''), valuable_col ) AS valuable_col,...```3. Define your custom masking routine to strip the prefix and hash the value if the prefix exists, otherwise ignore itI think this would essentially get you what you want, but it looks brittle and is somewhat complex. Better to avoid if business requirements permit.",

Shopify: read call-limit/GraphQL cost headers, sleep until budget refills, and use webhooks to push high-change objects into a queue. Stripe: smaller page sizes, client timeouts, and idempotent upserts keyed by id + updated.Handle schema drift by landing raw JSON first, then normalizing to staging; auto-add nullable columns, and let dbt tests flag new fields. Put connectors in Docker, schedule with Prefect or Dagster, alert on freshness and error rate, and keep a dead-letter for bad records.

At the same time, it is probably one of the very few vendors that can deliver a truly end-to-end data platform both on-prem and in the cloud. While Hadoop, and the architectural principles behind it, remain the backbone of big data, today the focus is on the powerful open-source technologies that sit on top of it and enable modern data architectures: Spark, MPP DWH engines, Iceberg, Airflow, Kafka, OpDB, NiFi, a lot of niche tools and the full set of UX augmentations, security and governance capabilities that unify everything under one roof regardles the infra underneath. And if you need more, Cloudera provides private, on-prem, or cloud-based environments for running your data applications, workbenches, and ML/AI models, all while keeping your data and applications securely within your own premises (or cloud account).Thanks for reading my sales pitch.

I worked with a Microsoft MVP (recent MVP), author of several books, and expert level. His academic training is religious studies.It’s also true that a non-computer science background puts you at a disadvantage you should consider. It would be wise to strategically plan how you will overcome this gap - and which areas you need to cover in what order. Surely, you don’t need to go back to school and major in it - but you also can’t ignore it. It sounds like you are approaching this in a very logical manner. I suggest you spend some time looking at real colleges, reviewing their requirements for computer science (classes) and look through some syllabus’s. The outcome of this exercise is to gain visibility in what you are missing - essentially benchmark. Then you can look at this and see what you think is relevant to you. For example a class in TCP/IP may not be so important for data engineering. This should all your anxiety by helping you to understand how you fit. Once you find some classes you think you are missing, just look at the syllabus, find the book, and buy the previous version of the book on Amazon for $10. Read it, study it, master it - move on. I really don’t see computer science degrees teaching data warehousing - so keep this in mind. You might be better off starting with Kimball (follow my same instructions). I would prioritize star schemas over compilers!Edit: a computer science degree isn’t a finish line, it’s a piece of paper. Looking at my peers, 20 years later, some of them were brilliant and really accelerated in their careers. Others got A’s on tests but couldn’t do hands on. They didn’t survive in the real world. I did very poor on tests, well on labs, and great post university. It’s all about how you apply your knowledge - the piece of paper only gets you the job interview.",

Use the available controls: \"Use the maximum bytes billed setting to limit query costs\", use reservations and all it's mechanisms like sharing slots or not. This can prevent very large queries to create unexpected havoc. Frustrating to users? Maybe, but then you can2. Educate the users, talk to your leads about the cost created by uneducated users, and try to get people to a level of cost-awareness in which they should understand what at the worst practices, and when to ask for help to your DE team. Usually when you tell leadership about how much money is lost because people don't know, they are willing to put some time/resources to knowledge sharing.I'm guessing you have flat rate pricing no? Maybe consider commitments and flat the curve with Max slots in your reservations.BigQuery has a lot of knobs and practices to decrease nasty surprises, but there's a lot to read and try",

But I want to say something different this time.Sometimes, the only way to regain control is to get smaller for a while. When companies lose control, what do they do? Layoffs. They shrink, stabilize, fix the mess, and then grow again.You can apply the same mindset to BigQuery.If it is possible in your org, try this for 1–2 months: cut access from unskilled users. Not forever, just long enough to stop the random migrations and “oops I scanned 40 TB” moments. Let a small, competent group model the data first. Build solid, optimized tables that everyone else can use safely.Then give people access back in stages. But pair that with training. Teach them how to use partitions, clusters, and how cost scales. Once they’re actually proficient, open things up again.It’s the same as raising a kid. You don’t give full freedom on day one. You limit, teach, guide, and expand as they grow.Organizations are no different. Sometimes you need to intentionally shrink the surface area, regain control, and only then let people roam free again. This approach can save you from endless BigQuery firefighting.",

We use tools to change the content and structure of our data so that a push to each branch is idempotent. For example, our transformation layer uses a dbt ci similar to what is described in their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) (modified for our specific workflow). Our consumers build either off of UAT or PROD, depending on the stage of the feature we are building for them. Unlike typical git workflows for stateless applications, our data engineers need to merge to each branch sequentially. It looks like this:1) Merge Feature to DEV - check if DEV Environment data passes tests2) Merge Feature to UAT - consumers connect their dashboards/scripts/aimodels to UAT environment and report back on what they need changed3) Merge Feature to PROD - once consumers are happy, we release to prod, which has some additional checks and needs a senior data eng to sign off Major downside of the approach we have not been able to resolve is that PROD/UAT/DEV branches will have a different commit history.",

Are you delivering to a seperate team that is the data analysts, or are the analyst within your team? If your team includes the DEs, AEs, and DAs then I could see there being a struggle to deliver some layers (medallions) to UAT but not others. On the other hand, if your a team of Engineers delivering to Analysts, I think its easier to point to milestone/wins that enable the analysts. Those \"building blocks\" (facts and dims, cleansed tables, or tables w surrogate keys) I would consider to be discreet things sent into UAT separately. Thoughts I've had myself about the Medallion architecture: If you're implementing a dimensional data model (star schema), doesn't it make sense to say this is represented by the \"Silver\" layer?",

Meaning no active dev which means consumers have assurance that the tables are just gonna disappear or change schemas b/c engineers are working on new features. Also thinking in terms of merge strategies, I picture UAT being behind dev. This matters more in a larger org, but dev can move ahead and work on features that are not ready to be UAT-ed. This allows consumers to do a more thorough job of validating, which I often think of as \"I need to go talk to so-and-so who knows the business more to see if these results look right\", and if so-and-so is busy for the next week then at least engineers can move forward on the dev branch.",

I can't imagine that every transaction will be completely unique but if you can identify what transactions are in okay and how they are being measured then doing your aggregations should be easier. I think one of the issues you are running into is having a very large column count with what I presume it's a row orientated database. In this setup you are having to read the whole row, regardless of how little you want to process. If you can trade columns for rows you should be more performant.I appreciate you're junior in this role so realistically, what guidance are you getting at work to respond this?

You also get the benefit that you can write your features once and switch query engine later as needed, which brings me to #2.For #2, SQL Server is not going to scale well for what you’re trying to do. I think a better columnar query engine would work better especially for wide datasets like your features. If you use Narwhals for #1, you can then test out some others including Polars and duckdb that don’t require any special infrastructure beyond installing a Python package. You may find that by doing your heavy joins in SQL then dumping to a file/in-memory, these other query engines are better suited for generating the features.",

Many companies are not big enough to have a team dedicated solely to EDI, but I have seen a lot of companies outsource it.As a DE, I’ve only worked heavily in EDI at one company, but that’s because I was the “go to” tech guy for just about everything. I basically setup up the field mappings to our ERP, did some testing with vendors/distributors, and handed off to the respective department. That department then owned the process from there.EDI could be a nice to have on your resume if you come across it in the wild, but I don’t see a lot of companies asking for it for DE roles.

First of all, you can simply install Airflow as a Python dependency and use the Airflow standalone mode: AIRFLOW_VERSION=3.1.3 PYTHON_VERSION=\"$(python -c 'import sys; print(f\"{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\")')\" CONSTRAINT_URL=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-${AIRFLOW_VERSION}/constraints-${PYTHON_VERSION}.txt\" uv pip install \"apache-airflow==${AIRFLOW_VERSION}\" --constraint \"${CONSTRAINT_URL}\" airflow standaloneAlternatively, you can use Docker: [https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html)Or, what I would recommend, use the Astro CLI: [https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli)That is an open-source project, handling the project setup and Docker environment for you. I think that is ideal to get started with local development, as it also creates a basic Airflow project structure for you, where you can add your DAG. If you are on mac, just install it via brew install astro, then make a new directory for your project and run: astro dev initAnd afterwards, run the following command to start your local Airflow environment: astro dev startI would not recommend switching to Airflow 2, there are enough pragmatic ways to get the latest version running. If you still have issues, please share a few environment details and the actual error.Have fun :heart_hands:",

For the sites where there's no API and you're stuck with raw HTML, an LLM can still help extract structured fields from the scraped page.

Try to understand how they represent their data and transform it into a common schema that you upkeep yourself.For change detection it's kinda hard, we scrape over 500k listings every day at my workplace and when one vendor changes something we usually don't notice until someone complains downstream and we look into it.

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton \"context\" class or an abstract class for the \"job\" and re-use it everywhere. When I say \"configuration\" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.Overall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",

To hire a freelancer or get some better feedback from us here, you'll need a comprehensive list of all the platforms you want to source data from, the available methods of extracting that data, where you want to send it, and how you want to interact with it.

Ideally once a year so that you can can use the latter one to look for improvements or failures.I've found this to be extremely successful, with comments from users like this priceless one: **\"the metrics aren't well-organized or very accurate so whenever I need a metric I look for multiple redundant metrics and just average them together.\"**I then took the survey results, formatted them into insight categories, and used them to create some projections, like:* Query writing cost: 20% of the 200 users provided survey responses, we'll assume that this is a representative sampling. Based on this it appears that new queries take an average of 2 hours to validate we're using the data correctly, given X new queries per month this translates to Y total time and vast friction. Given improvements in the data model & data catalog we believe that we can get this down from 2 hours to 15 minutes - which saves us Z total time.* Data quality cost: same approach* ETL & modeling cost: same approachGood luck!",

If you can't really measure the impact of cleaning up the data model and there is no organizational pain from the current mess, it is kind of hard to justify spending time on the activity when you could be spending time on more measurable revenue generating or cost cutting items.My suggestion would be add an additional 20% of effort to each initiative on your roadmap that the engineers can use addressing technical debt. Specifically, my suggestion would be for them to simplify the model as they work on delivering on the roadmap initiatives and focus on decluttering one entity in the model during each initiative.Also, a nice side effect will be downstream items consuming the model will break as you make the updates. Some of those will go unnoticed and will give you more visibility in to what is actually being used. This will help you prioritize your work in the future.",

Not to discourage you, but my two cents if you're main goal is maximising TC, I'd say getting into IT isn't worth it. No one knows, but my guess is you're path of maximal TC will be to stick in traditional eng and eventually transition to management. That will probably pay off better in the long term and be easier then trying to move to IT/DE.If you do want advice on moving, I made the transition through self study. What I did first, and my recommendation is to start with cs50 which is Harvard's free into to computer science course. I think it's worth doing even if you end up studying a master's. If probably also recommend casting a wide net for data or software engineering, especially look out for embedded engineering which might be a good niche giving your background. Good luck again!",

Run one entrypoint script via Task Scheduler or SQL Server Agent. Add retries with backoff, row counts/hash checks, and write logs to both a file and a SQL table; send email or Teams alerts on failure. Keep secrets in Windows Credential Manager or Key Vault. Wrap everything in a single CLI, pin dependencies, and document a simple runbook so the next co-op can operate it. If you want extra safety, containerize the job and schedule the container.If leadership insists on Azure, keep it minimal: one ADF pipeline that triggers a single Function or Container App to run the whole script; skip the Blob staging. I’ve used Prefect and Azure Automation for light orchestration; DreamFactory helped expose a small SQL API so Functions didn’t need direct DB creds.Given your scale and team, the VM approach is simplest and easiest to maintain.",

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first. I don’t think your CMS and Docs will expand on an exponential scale compared to the other 2.Explore docker, kubernetes and Airflow, then see if you can have your ETL/ELT processes organised for them to be running in parallel or sequence. I’m not too sure cost-wise if it’s cheaper to run via EC2 instances or directly using the services directly in cloud (Google Composer). Use airflow to produce an aggregated table so that the BI reports pull the required info quickly.For the 60 man organisation, ask yourself if the staff are well versed to write their own queries, or are they excel-dependent. Can they write their own views? But also subject this to some form of approval before running it directly in the database. A SELECT * will incur costs to the moon very quickly.You need to assess if transformed data is sufficient for now (data warehouse), and considering transitioning to a data lake after when you are integrating data from other sources.I hope that offers some direction for you.

I will keep the advice general and vendor-neutral.You are on the right track. What you are feeling now is the natural boundary of relying on complex views in OLTP Postgres for BI and cross-system logic. The good news is that your data volume is still small, so you have a lot of cheap, simple options before needing a heavy architecture.A very important point: you do not need to move out of Postgres yet. One of the biggest cost-effective wins is to stop running 20-join views and instead materialize those transformations into tables on a schedule. Postgres can easily serve modeled fact and dimension tables for years at your size. And even in a warehouse or a data lake, you end up materializing tables anyway, so this work is never wasted.If you eventually add a warehouse, S3 + Athena or Snowflake are both very cost-conscious. You are already on AWS, your data volumes are small, and both fit the medallion pattern cleanly. Athena is extremely cheap (5$ / TB processed). Snowflake gives more predictable performance on small workloads. If you are comfortable running your own infra, ClickHouse on a single VM is one of the strongest low-cost OLAP choices and works well for real-time dashboards.Whatever platform you choose, keep your transformations in SQL. At your scale, you do not need Spark or distributed compute. Most transformations and even ML feature engineering can be done in SQL. Use Python only where absolutely necessary.A big structural improvement is to model your Backend and Camunda data properly once. Instead of repeating joins or routing everything through a massive consolidated view, create clean fact and dimension tables in Postgres or the warehouse. This will eliminate most of your current performance limitations.For ML and RAG, storing curated datasets as Parquet in S3 is ideal. Cheap, flexible, and compatible with all downstream tools.For ingestion, modeling, scheduling, and lineage, you can keep things simple by using a single unified tool. Bruin can pull from&to Postgres and APIs, run SQL transformations, and give you lineage and a catalog without stitching together multiple systems.If you prefer a more modular setup, dbt plus a scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) is the standard alternative.At your stage, a simple setup is enough: keep everything in Postgres with materialized tables, or store raw data in S3 and model it in Athena or Snowflake before sending it to Metabase and saving ML datasets in Parquet. This keeps costs low and gives you a clean foundation for BI, ML, and RAG.",

Statistical correlation: check overlapping values between columns across tables; high overlap indicates possible joins.3.

As a non-regular duckdb user, I did not expect this # just because I replaced 0 with 9 in the original CSVI didn't try to address these issues and then re-compare on performance.zsv was designed not to make opinions about your data, without explicit instructions otherwise. I understand there are a lot of good reasons in favor of being opinionated by default, but that's a separate matter. Re performance, I suspect if duckdb is using indexing or parallelization, which is not yet implemented in zsv, it could be much faster in elapsed time where core/CPU is not maxed, but I can't see anything from these quick tests suggesting that DuckDB is faster in total CPU time or in a single-threaded environment, or in an environment where all CPU cores are otherwise being maxed out. I'm not even sure DuckDB's output is correct when it doesn't report an error (see above example with the extraneous text in the output)-- I see plenty of recent issues reported that DuckDB does not handle double-quotes correctly, though at least some seem to have been resolved. That said, I'm very interested in any evidence anyone finds to the contrary of this brief dive!",

I will comment again when I have verified for certain but I believe that your tests show that DuckDB and Polars can be much faster in \"wall clock\" time if they parallelize (multi-thread) and the computer is not CPU+core bound, but that ZSV is still far faster on a per-pipeline / thread basis-- notice that the user time is 3x and 5x faster, respectively (which is actually a much better difference than I would have anticipated).I suspect DuckDB and Polars are only able to parallelize when they are not reading from a stdin stream and by making certain assumptions about the CSV, that could break under certain input conditions... but I may be wrong.I know that all of the above sounds a bit conjectural and unsupported, so I am not expecting to convince anyone here-- just mentioning, and I will go do some digging and verify either way. Once I have done that, I will update the zsv home to provide more clarification per whatever those findings are.In any case, I appreciate the comments!",

I originally started in business but quickly realized the people in that major at my school were morons, so I pivoted to economics for more flexibility. I had zero trouble framing my background in a way that made sense for analytical roles.What I noticed, though, was that the math majors who were definitely smarter than me struggled to translate what they learned into real-world value. With tech or coding, no one cares *how* you learned the skills; you can pick them up on the side. I used the fundamentals of economic thinking to guide how and why I learned technology.In 2025, you barely need more than CS50 level coding skills and a few personal projects to get started. And when the tech bubble burst, I wasn’t lumped in with the thousands of CS grads who could code but didn’t understand the business problems they were solving, which is a very dangerous trap.For me, having an analytical mindset with a self-driven focus on technology opened a ton of doors, gave me flexibility, and has been lucrative. I didn’t make as much as my CS friends when we graduated in 2017, but I eventually caught up and even moved ahead into management and strategy roles while many of them stayed or are stuck being code monkeys or data janitors (still well-paid, but gets old quick).",

Primarily used SQL and Alteryx with some tableau data viz sprinkled in. Here I started dabbling with API integrations to help automate aspects of my job because I hated the “manuality” of it if that makes sense. -> Data Engineer (current) $125,000/yr + 10%-20% bonus potential.

They stressed the importance of domain knowledge in this field... not many data engineers come in with that business and contextual knowledge, which may lead to low retention and motivation rates. Your multidisciplinary background is valuable. Being able to understand the economics context with the data you're working with is critical. Me, I have a communications master's degree-- pivoting after 15 years of media related work. And despite not having a CS background, my background is a strength because it's important to communicate your findings, translating technical terms to layman's terms, and convincing the stakeholders of the business value (or risk if you're advising them against certain actions). My advice is to find local meetups, career fairs, mixers etc. and make in-person connections.

Do I still want to grow my technical skills? If I become a manager, would this hinder my time capacity to juggle both technical projects and managing people at the same time.2. If I become a leader - what kind of leader should I be? Should I stay technical and handle 50% of the implementation, or focus more on the high level architectures and strategies of the team.I'd also encourage you to discuss your concerns with your CDO - since he has more context on your situation. Communicate openly about your goals, and create an actionable plan on how you can achieve them.>Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role?Only consider this if you're interested in Statistics/Quantitative projects. A big part of Data Science is story-telling and communicating results to business stakeholders.I personally stuck with DE because I love the software part of the job; building pipelines, optimizing Spark jobs, managing AWS/GCP costs etc.Most people don't realize Data Science has more to do with communication than technical - that's why many Econ/Social Sciences people do well in data science (not talking about MLOps or hard core data science PhD jobs of course)>What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path? \\*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?15% raise is reasonable for promotions or \"very good\" performances. In general, single digit raise for non-promotions is normal. Double digit for promotions, exceptional or new job.For salary negotiations, I'd start with having a X number, where X is the highest you'd want. Then ask for slightly higher than X. Also have a number Y which is the minimum salary you would accept,During salary conversations, try to center the conversation around your future responsibilities at the company, and re-defining your current scope of job to match that new salary.Hope this helps!",

That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.If you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.What kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables? As a fully managed solution, you could check out Estuary. It can handle log-based CDC and any of your destinations + a bunch of cool features like schema evolution. I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",

Create a denormalized representation of this, and then describe it using something like jsonschema for the data contract. * Whenever any one of these attributes changes, generate the domain object and publish to something like kafka/kinesis/etc. * The consumer can subscribe to the feed, redirect it into a file or table, etc. And from there are in a better position to perform additional transformations on the data.",

But event drive in analytics is a pretty rare use case. For the most part folks want real-time or on a set schedule. Doing something by events kinda assumes that you are not batch processing your data, which is fairly rare and generally only done on higher skilled data teams. For example we use Kafka Connect to stream real-time data to Snowflake. I would never trigger an event after it landed in Snowflake I would do it from the stream. Or more likely in the producing application.If you are batch processing you have some orchestration tool where you can easily take some action.Feels like a solution searching for a problem.But maybe I could be missing something.",

Said in another way, you could (in fact, I do) have jobs that are processing records in batches (everything from the past 24 hrs), BUT the way those jobs are triggered is thru a pub/sub architecture. Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the \"choosing batch\" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...** Batch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern. The use case we up against still does **not require streaming**, It's more about cramming a growning amount of ETL into the off business hours. This is becoming more of a need and less of a wish as complexity grows and threading needles with schedules no longer is practical.",

Airflow or other orchestrators have the ability to use 'sensors' to check if partitions of tables exist in warehouses or that new files have been uploaded to s3/sftp. Alternatively the upload process could write all customer or order related data to the same table and append additional 'key' data like `logical_set, date_partition, order_id, customer_id`. Then have an incremental DBT model that looks for the highest rendered partition of each logical set, and runs based on those. I don't think most systems use fancy lineage or data registries. But the individual ETL job would have a high watermark for each logical type and only advance when it can. But we use this for Google Analytics across multiple accounts and regions, where they have partitions in bigquery that show up sometimes hours apart. Each chunk is staged and loaded, and then SQL queries executed over them, as they become available.",

To some people it might feel like expecting them to read classical literature before reading a children’s book (to be clear I’m not saying that Python or similar languages are childish…the analogy only works so far).I started it with JavaScript and I don’t think that going back in time and starting with something like C would have necessarily made me a better programmer.

That, to me, is the real problem, not whether one language, like Python, is the best choice or not when you are starting out.I've begun lots of videos that have promised to teach me, I don't know, Terraform in two hours only to become bored out of my skull in 15 minutes because the teaching is terrible (mainly because IT people generally do not know how to teach, because they don't know how to communicate) and to move on to watching videos of Rottweiler puppies for three hours straight.There's a reason why documentation can be awful. It's because many people who know how to do IT-type stuff are incredibly good at doing those kinds of things. What they are generally terrible at is communication, for example explaining how some library or other works.Good succinct explanations would make even the most difficult technology accessible to all. Think about Amazon Web Services. When I started to look into it a few years ago I became really depressed because I thought I had suddenly become stupid. It was almost impenetrable. Now that I know something about it I find myself asking, \"Would it really hurt AWS to write just a few pages – just two, for crying out aloud – that tells beginners what the hell the whole thing is about?\"I have just bought a book on Terraform. It's good but only because I already know about Terraform. Documentation is similar. Too much of it is written by people who think that everyone understands things already. In which case, why do they bother writing the documentation in the first place?",

Effective communication helps iron out *so many* unclear requirements before its a problem, helps me guide them towards appropriate technical solutions before they've already made a decision in some direction, and allows me to convey knowledge about our complex environments and systems so that they can be better informed without it coming off as condescending. It encourages an open and honest dialog. All of that directly correlates to figuring things out efficiently with less confusion/chaos, which is the main efficiency vampire in my corporate world. Building rapport, aka having people actually like and trust me, makes people feel comfortable. When they're comfortable, they'll listen and take advice much better. They'll pay attention and appreciate my input instead of being like \"fuck, we *have* to talk to the engineering team\". They'll be more willing to be forgiving and understanding if there is some issue, because they like me and know I generally do my best to get their stuff handled properly. And, when I inevitably have to rain on someone's parade/be the bearer of bad news, they take it better because they intrinsically trust me and my judgement. They know I'm not bullshitting them (at least too much) and are more willing to resolve by moving forward instead of by escalating or complaining.",

I was surprised to learn that it was just as much about learning how to look at the world and how to think about what you observe as it was about the physical skills of drawing or painting. I had to learn to observe negative space, proportions, values, and all sorts of details that I wouldn’t have even noticed if I hadn’t trained my brain to think that way. It is a completely different way of thinking (and seeing the world) from programming. Switching between the two ways of thinking I found to be incredibly difficult and mentally exhausting.

Never again in your life will you be surrounded by people whose fulltime occupation is improving themselves.

It’s pretty easy to go to C++ with an uunderstanding of C, but hard to come back to C when you’re accustomed to things like vectors, stdlib functions and so on.I urge you to have atleast a minimal amount of pure C programming in low level fundamentals like memory, containers like arrays and so on. You can continue using C++, but you’re still being abstracted away from low level, just that you still have an option should you choose it.By extension, learn a tiny bit of assembly as well. It’s generally impractical and isn’t seen as a general use language, but it comes in handy some times. Not to mention the theoretical understanding you develop in learning to use it, and a few discouraged programming paradigms that it makes you use like goto. It makes you think in interesting ways.",

Frontend development is about building user interfaces, while C++ will teach you how computers and memory actually work under the hood. You’ll learn way more by diving deep into data structures, algorithms, and systems programming than by trying to juggle two paths at once. Add Git, Linux, and CMake early, and after each topic, build something small, a console app, a mini game, or even your own data structure implementation. That’s where real learning happens. Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals, you can always switch directions later, but trying to mix frontend and C++ from the start will only slow you down.",

Almost any large regex matching multiple conditions is fun to write, but hell to read back years later.I really only recall one line of code that I didn’t understand. 1992, some C code, it was an unreachable line of code in a 5,000 line module, yet.. if it was deleted the code would not compile.I gave the module to a guy that worked for me, he lost several days trying to solve it. He failed too.The module went out of production in 1995 so I don’t need to think about that line anymore. Oh, I recall a serial coms package from the late 80s/early 90s.. CrossTalk - had its own app language called CASL, was very Basic/Pascal like. It had a pop function that would remove the last program address from the stack.I wrote a multithreaded hardware monitoring program sitting on top of some multiport serial cards, and at the time it made sense (bad idea), and I used the pop function so the program flow didn’t go back to the calling function, but would go back to the one before that.

Though you might also do quite a bit of C if you focus on embedded systems. CS and SE are both software-focused, but CS focuses more on the lower level infrastructure and usually applies more computational mathematics and algorithms to make complex computations faster and more efficiently. SE is more higher level and focuses on architectural patterns of larger complex systems and making them more scalable and maintainable.Source: I was a CE major that switched to SE major during the second half of my studies.

It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.Computer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.Computer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.Software Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.Purist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.A spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.A spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.Whereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.In Summary,If you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas. If you enjoy mucking about with that, then Computer Engineering is the field of study for you.If you think that you might enjoy Software Engineering, start biting your teeth on C and C++ if you haven't done so already, do some tutorials in Qt (or any other application development framework), and get familiar with POSIX operating systemsIf you think that you might enjoy Computer Science, study the differences between binary search trees, B-Trees, and B+-Trees. Read up on the latest AI craze. Try and understand what a Quaternion is and how it is used in 3D graphics.Feel free to throw any questions my way.",

You'll be doing several physics classes and getting a more traditional Engineering degree.Computer Science takes a step back and focuses less on the Electrical Engineering portion and introduces more high level languages and actual coding work. You'll still take some upper level mathematics, but you aren't going to need to know about how to solder components or do any physics beyond the intro level. Software Engineering generally removes even more upper level mathematics and caps you out at Calculus or Discrete Mathematics. It is focused the most on coding and software development as a field. This is what most people actually want. Special mention goes out to the IT and Networking degrees that will also introduce coding classes, but also focus on other aspects of how computers interact with the world at large.",

About 75% of what you'll be doing will be the same no matter which major you go for. In a few universities, they are very upfront about this: you might enter a general ICT program, and then in your 4th year, you choose a specialization which might be Software Engineering, Data Science or Computer Engineering. In most cases, there's huge overlap in these majors.That is because these programs tend to focus mostly on skill-building. It's useless to just have knowledge if you can't \"run\" fast enough, or \"jump\" high enough, mentally-speaking, to do actually code at an effective level. That's why using generative AI to help too much is basically shooting yourself in the foot, as you're wasting all that time and money for no actual gain.Computer Science mostly involves math and logic. Computer Engineering adds electronics to math and logic. Software Engineering adds a little \"business management\" to math and logic. There are also new, strange-sounding ones like Digital Engineering which is very similar to Software Engineering, but is more specific to emerging technologies.",

Maybe a mod for one of your favorite video games. Do a little research into a good language for making that happen, then just make it.If you want to do low-level programming, such as interfacing with an operating system, C++ will be more useful. If you want to do game development, C# will be more useful.

You just started so don’t worry, and, don’t burn out, but keep studying and upskillingBeing real here, if after 1-2 years there is no improvement, they’ll let you go, I’ve been there and seen others as well. Companies don’t want work that is supposedly doable in normal hours to take extra, it just means it isn’t the right fit (in my case I was good at react and bad at angular and hated it, letting me go was the right move).If the work is a good fit you’ll pick it up fast and excel at it, if it isn’t no worries you find a job that’s a better fit.",

        "body": "Your boss already told you what they think of you and what's expected.Take their advice. Tone back the anxiety and dread and allow yourself to rest a little, making bits of progress. Follow their request. Be more communicative. If you were there for that long, they likely won't be firing you if you maintain a positive attitude, check in more, and ask for advice. In fact, you could probably slow your progress to an absolute crawl, but they might not care if you're really great to be around and look as if you're working hard..Don't devolve yourself into a puddle of stress and anxiety. When you talk to your boss, don't have every conversation be about how stressed you are, how you're feeling down, etc. Instead, hold it in and be chipper. Instead of, \"I'm so stressed I don't know what to do can you help me?\", ask \"hey, I got done with that task you gave me! Am I progressing alright? If you need to me to speed it up, I'll be right on it!\"If they tell you're great with some little nitpick, don't speed up and stress. Thank them for the feedback and maybe throw in a nice comment or two. If they say you can pick up the pace a little, don't speed up and stress. Instead, \"Got it! I'll get right to it! Do you have any advice for me to help me along, perhaps something to focus in on?\"They might give advice or direct you to your coworkers.  When you talk to your coworkers, don't be down, sad, and anxious. Let them know, \"man, I've been making so much progress but that imposter syndrome is vicious. You ever get that feeling?\" If they're open to it, ask them what they've done to overcome it and how they progressed. You can spin negative things in a positive light through tone, word choice, and body language. You can also throw in, \"I finished that one task, for some reason it was an absolute doozy! Still. I'm sorry for getting in a bit late. Would you have some advice for being more effective next time?\" to whoever assigns the task. They may already say it via their response, but you can also slip in a question about their expectations for the time frame and how to speed up your workflow to match it..Stop judging yourself based on your own inflated metrics. Don't judge yourself on other people's behalf. Let them determine whether you're making good progress (like your boss said) or not.As long as you actively *show* people you're improving, then they'll be lenient towards you. You don't show them by sitting in a corner by yourself stressing. You actively talk to them, keep it positive, don't reveal how seriously stressed you've been, and slowly open *them* up for advice and help. See what they're feeling, their thoughts, and their processes. Ask for their advice on your current work, your plans for progress, etc. Don't overwhelm them, but give them little bits to bite at while you're allowing them to speak a lot about themselves and their work/feelings. Make sure to let them know how great their advice was after you've implemented it.If you present yourself as a good listener, pleasant to talk to, open to feedback, and always seeking advice, even if your progress is a small fraction of the speed it is now, people will *feel* like you're working harder than ever before, even with missing tasks dates. That's the beauty of perception.",

If necessary then participate in the next team event and just have either one on one talk or one on X talk. Either sit down with them in a sauna and just sit in that hot place and talk with everybody. Or, if you are drinking alcohol then drink with others. Or something else. Point being: be in a relaxing environment and just talk with people as fellow people not as your team mates. Talking helps. Little ranting helps. They will tell you how they see it. Just bond with your team not grow distanced of everybody.But coming back to your work then it is absolutely normal that you won't be on the same level as everybody else after being a junior just for 5 months. Forget comparing yourself with mid-level or senior-level developers. They are mid and senior because they have a whole lot of more experience, knowledge and skills. And they gained it with time. They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree. Do you have a degree or you have a diploma or neither? Some juniors participated in computer clubs and such, during their studies. Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.Compare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.Ask your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.You are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.Bugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.Your boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not). And people will help you out then. If you feel that you are running out of hours then talk with your boss. It is his job to ask more hours from the client or re-prioritize tasks. But when you are not communicating with your team and with your boss, then nobody can help you.",

We have noticed how one team had started producing visibly worse PRs recently. With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using \"import this.is.some.package.dependency\" they use it as \"var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization\", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to \"fix\" tests).We have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. \"IDK\" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.There have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. We also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.Also, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool). Adding a feature without tests that verify its functionality, that also is not an option. The coverage % will drop and is visible from the PR.I'd say that first talk with these bad actors. If talking does not work then escalate it to your manager. And just reject such PRs / do not approve these. Set merge rules to prohibit a merge without an approval. So they can't even sneak pass your unapproved review.",

I've worked with plenty of indie teams of the latter, and the skill/experience level of the programmers that you find in those are very low. It's usually someone who just started learning game dev after watching a tutorial video on YouTube. Sometimes, you find someone who already knows how to code because they're a CS major in college or something. It's almost never an actual experienced programmer, because they're usually not out and about looking for unpaid or rev-share work. It's one of the main reasons why I stopped working with other programmers on projects. I can code the game by myself, and I team up with artists, composers, etc., to cover the skills I'm not good at. Finding a good programmer out in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the bad ones just slow down the team. Even when someone says they have several years of experience, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I worked for a studio with a dev whose LinkedIn showed 3 years of game dev experience, but he didn't understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. He wrote a path finding algorithm that took 3-7 seconds instead of the 40 milliseconds it should have taken after I fixed the bug. The bug? The GetNeighbors function was iterating over every tile in the game board (several thousand of them) to find the neighboring tiles each time it was called, instead of simply retrieving a stored list of neighbors or using a constant time method like adding/subtracting 1 to the X, Y, Z coordinates. If your studio is actually paying people, your studio needs to re-evaluate what they're paying for. If it's a team of volunteers, just let go of the unskilled programmers.I also hope that your studio isn't trying to build a MMORPG that's supposed to have thousands of players all in the same server interacting with each other in real-time or something along that line. If the project is over scoped to a degree that's challenging even for AAA studios, it's very unlikely that your studio will succeed with a team of volunteers who have no obligation to stay on the project. I've seen plenty of those from the numerous \"idea guys\" that frequent the collaboration channels on game dev Discord servers.",

Learn how to code without AI, re-learn the basics and start from scratch because that is what its going to take. Do it in your free time so it doesnt immediately affect your work. Pick a stack and stick with it, i suggest picking something you have already worked with because you will already be familiar with it.Do some small projects without AI, just using your problem solving skills, documentation, and stack overflow if you need. You will still need to identify a problem, identify multiple solutions, and decide which solution is best applicable to your problem. You wont git gud tomorrow or next week. Itll take time but you need to put in the work and stop outsourcing to AI. AI should be an assistant not a crutch.",

A core language in Android still. Fun fact, C# began life as a Java clone. With Oracle and Microsoft backing them, respectively, they're also fine.3. Fuck AI. Also, languages don't matter as much as learning how to program. Dealing with lots of paradigms is good, so if you haven't messed around with functional programming, play with that.",

It would help to know alot about the local population nearest the target location, their timing, methods, patterns... I could go on and on and on. if you gotta break into shit, it helps to know as much about it as possible, in every way possible, from every angle possible. pentesting is like the techno version of that, so yeah its not software engineering, but its certainly not easier then just software engineering, and while you wont need to know how to build and maintain tiktok 2.0, you still gotta know a lot about a lot, and for many pentesters that overall career starts with doing software engineering, you can also get into security by being a systems administration nerd or network engineering nerd, so if you dont wanna do make software then go the networking/admin angle and so lookup reddits for those other techno guys and ask questions there, r/sysadmin is a popular one.",

Like this simple little program: arr = [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"] arr.map((a,b,c) => console.log({a,b,c}))It creates an array `arr`, and then calls `.map` on it, logging every \"iteration\". And it shows you that index 0 is called first, then index 1, then index 2 and so on - just like in a loop.Doing a similar experiment with .sort, shows how that algorithm is apparently a bit more recursive, or at least it doesn't iterate cleanly from 0 to length-1.But what truly happens you'll probably never know - and when you do, the JIT compiler probably optimizes it away :)",

If you’re in Sales now, I’m assuming you’re good at communicating, persuasion and maybe how business works. Translating tech talk to something simple so that stakeholders can understand is essential. You don’t need to be super techy to be a BA, you need to be organized, communicate clearly, and able to move the “needle-over” on projects consistently. Not saying this is an Easy job whatsoever, but it is fulfilling and can be learned. Data Analyst make data digestible to stakeholders so that they can make informed business decisions. Good luck",

        "body": "I did a career switch also when being 28. From logistics to CS. Logistics was fine but it did not fascinate me. Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.Self-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google \"X roadmap\" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.With self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. Also, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.And then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. Now, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. Also, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. I will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study. But if you do not have a strong plan to have an advantage over degree holders, then go for a degree.",

If you can then check out which courses these two curriculums are having. And then decide based on that. If the curriculum is not listing the courses then contact a dean office or a student councilor and ask from them. It is their job to guide students and people who want to start their studies in given university.But going purely by a guess then better pick software engineering. It should cover more than just a development. Because real life software development is not only writing code but more than that. Software engineering curriculum should be more relevant. But that is just a guess based on the names of curriculums. When you want a real answer then contact the university.Game development does not mean you'll be making a game from start to end. Even in games there is a backend, frontend/design, infrastructure, devops, data science, cyber security, QA, etc. Different roles. And, let's say you will pick game development. Are there any jobs in your area for game developers? And when it comes to web application development and being a backend side developer, then again, decide it based on the job offers in your area. Are there right now jobs for juniors? Where I live, the job market is not doing well. We are living inside an AI bubble. Non-IT people (HR, managers and such) are investing more into AI tools because they think that the AI is better than a human developer. And they are not hiring juniors that much. As a software developer I say, the current AI is performing perhaps worse than some junior developers. Yes, it can generate code but it requires a constant overseeing. Or it will generate nonsense that a)does not compile, b)deletes existing functionality, c)introduces bugs, d)does not cover all the required use cases.When the bubble will pop then there will be again more openings for juniors. Juniors so far should learn their specialty AND should learn how to use the AI (to be competitive) and how to NOT use the AI.",

Either way is valid and people will generally understand what you mean either way as long as you’re consistent.",

And then you have a new problem: figuring out why your solution is wrong.This isn't a problem. It's just how programming works. If you are easily frustrated by this, then the solution is either to just keep learning and practicing and doing problems until it doesn't bother you as much, or else find a new hobby with fewer built-in frustrations.Regular practice is key. There are lots of good problem sets out there. For Python, I'm a fan of the Exercism tracks, although they can be a little unfriendly for very new programmers.",

Most of the times i’m proud of what i learned and feel the energy to go on. Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier. In this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.Main get away is, enjoy the process! Have fun! Build things you like or miss. Then you can do a lot without burnout. Burnout does not really happen when it’s fun, it mostly comes from forcing your self to do things X amount of time while not enjoying it.",

You don't need to learn every single thing from all of those areas, or even from a single book. Just being familiar with the core ideas / basics helps a lot. Then slowly study more of those books and topics as time goes by.But here are some of the best programming books that were popular already back in the 1990s:* The Art Of Computer Programming series of books (Donald Knuth)* Design Patterns (Gamma, Helm, etc.)* Anti Patterns (Brown, Malveau)* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)* Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt, Thomas)* Introduction To Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson)Those should get you really far. And the more you test everything you've read and learned from the books, the faster you'll become good at what you do. So don't wait to try out the ideas from those books. Try them out when you're reading, if possible. Pick a project or two and develop them from start to finish. You'll learn tons that way. Only reading doesn't get you very far. You have to design and implement something larger.",

And in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.And of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.And most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.So there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.And they are often fun to create and use!",

The problem with it is that it easily leads to code that is hard to understand as values in each object's properties and inheritance hierarchy may change what methods do. The other way to code is functional programming where you call functions and what happens depends *only* of the arguments given to each function. Functions can be given other functions as arguments which makes this quite a bit more powerful than it sounds at first. By all means learn useful OOP, but also learn functional programming concepts.

Start with the basics: encapsulation to hide internals, inheritance for reusing code, polymorphism so methods adapt per class, and abstraction to keep things simple. Go with Python for its clean syntax—check Codecademy's free module or Python docs to build easy classes, say a Car with drive and honk methods. Java's good too if you want stricter rules; Oracle's tutorials are free and solid.Once that's down, build projects to make it real,a text RPG with inheriting character classes or a bank app with transaction types. Use Replit for quick setups and GitHub to track and learn from others. Do a couple projects monthly; that's where OOP clicks, not just reading.For deeper stuff, grab \"Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\" for its visual take or \"Clean Code\" for practical tips. freeCodeCamp has interactive sections, Coursera's Java OOP course from Duke is structured well, and YouTube spots like Corey Schafer show examples clearly. Later, skim design patterns like Singleton from the Gang of Four book, but don't rush. You got this.",

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive! If you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP! And of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health. That is another good exercise into understanding how to use Objects to represent entities.",

REST is pretty easy, and almost all languages can do that fast enough to the point that performance differences are negligible. It is more likely that you will lose performance to your own incompetence (which is true for all of us btw) rather than the language itself.Pick something you can be productive with and focus less on raw/theoretical performance.> I plan to integrate AI/machine learning features. Who doesn't...> I’m not too concerned about ease of use; my priority is performance and scalability for the API. Both options are fine. But your priority is whack.Optimise for productivity first, and get something out there. If you get to the point where the language performance is the bottleneck, then count yourself as successful. At that point you can afford a rewrite.Scalability is not really a language feature. That is more related to architecture. Scale can be done in whatever language, or be hindered in all languages given you do the wrong thing.> I’d love to hear your thoughts. Which language/framework would you recommend for high-performance APIs? Again, I disagree with the question. Go is a solid and pretty safe option IMHO. I've never been a fan of Python, so of the two, I'd choose Go.But beyond that, I don't really think the choice matters. Go, Java, Gleam, Elixir, Rust, C++, Python, C#, etc. In the vast majority of cases, all gets the job done, and the bigger impact comes down to which one you can be more effective with.",

I guess that anything developed in the past 40-50 years should be fast enough.Regarding scalability - what do you mean? Scaling the number of users, the number of requests, the frequency of requests, the number of services involved in each request? Scalability isn't just a word you can slap on the entire application, you need to be more specific. Also, it has more to do with the chosen architecture than the programming language - every language can scale to billions of objects without issues.What should the AI do? And why is that part of the REST API? There is usually no AI in REST, on the contrary, REST is (mostly) supposed to always return the same responses to the same requests - something AI doesn't really do.And finally - what do you actually mean by \"build my own REST API\"? Every single time you create an application that accepts HTTP requests, you kind of \"build your own REST API\" - it is literally just accepting requests and returning responses. Are you perhaps confusing an actual application with the interface to talk to it?",

You get good scalability with this approach: nodejs's Cluster functionality lets you run multiple long-lived server processes in parallel.It also offers robust database connection pooling, which helps with getting good performance under heavy concurrency.By the way, you need to choose a language, a server stack, a database, and a web framework, not just a language, for a project like this. I suggest Typescript, nodejs, Linux, PostgreSQL, and either Express or Fastify. If you really want to scale up to black-friday volume, take a look at the HAPI framework. I worked with a guy who supported high-volume production with that at Walmart.com, and he spoke well of it.My suggestions. Other people obviously have other suggestions.",

Programming is a craftmanship and requires that you practice on your own, learning about theory and watching tutorials are good to provide background material and to connect some dots.I would recommend that you take a step back, redo some old exercises, try different solutions, try different options, break things and fix them (that way you don't need to start with a blank page). Start with a really small project (like simply printing \"hello world\") so you can learn how to scaffold a new project. Work in iteration, add more complexity as you gain confidence. Explore, experiment, break and fix things along the way, be prepared that you will make mistakes (that is part of learning).",

You have to explain *exactly* what you want it to do before it can solve the problem.But, if you want to know what you need to know about C, the main thing is pointers and the second thing is manual memory management (malloc/free), but don't worry about that right now.

As your 2 years since graduating, \"is this for me?\" When your able to answer this question you'll either learn how to code, or not(AND THAT IS OKAY!) Cause if you went through 3-4 years of school, didn't learn how to code, and 2 years out, and still don't know.

I remember skipping classes sometimes just to finish a feature I was working on. For me, studying felt like a waste of time.What’s more, after about seven years of working as a freelancer, when I decided to switch to a full time job, I couldn’t get through the interviews even though I had built dozens of websites. There were always questions I had no idea about, even after all those years, or things I simply hadn’t used in a long time and couldn't remember anymore.So I started creating my own flashcards, for example for JavaScript, and printing them out. After two or three months of learning in my free time, I knew the answers to all the questions I had prepared. I passed nine out of ten interviews (meaning I answered all their questions), and I think about half of the companies ended up offering me a job.Based on that positive experience, over a year ago I built an app with flashcards and quizzes for developers to prepare for technical interviews, and now a few thousand people use it. Most flashcards are free (about 70 percent across 30 categories), and the subscription unlocks quizzes, which also help track progress more effectively. Of course, all of this was before AI appeared. Today it is much harder to even get an interview invitation and there are far more candidates applying for each position, so in my opinion it is even more important to be well prepared in order to stand out.If you’d like to test your knowledge, let me know.

In fact, it’s often used informally as an insult if someone *doesn’t* have it, but just like “communication” it’s one of those things everyone thinks is easy that they can “just do”, but actually can’t, because everyone gets it wrong.For example, ask someone in the street that “and” and “or” logic is identical if each argument is negated, and they probably won’t understand the concept:NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B)NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B)Despite the fact this itself is nothing to do with math or programming - it’s just “a rule of the universe”.If the above statements still confuse you, you will likely find quickly solving all manner of code problems quite challenging.",

It's easy to look at a problem and not consider any other similar problem you've seen before. But often, you solve a problem based on recalling solutions. I don't mean pure memorization. You want to generalize the technique. For example, sorting the values is one idea you can try.Clearly, some problems you can't solve. Also, the choice of problem solving does depend a bit on language. If you have a function without explicit loops (such as many functional programming languages), then you express your solution differently. If the language has certain features like `str ** n` doing `n` concatenations of the string, `str`, then that leads to a simpler solution than if the language did not have such a feature.I liked reading \"How to Solve It\", an old book by mathematician, George Polya.",

Windows likes to track every tiny thing during install, and random background stuff can ruin the package. a throwaway VM cuts down on the chaos.2. package through a build pipeline instead of the “wizard” tool the interactive MSIX Packaging Tool is notorious for unpredictable results. using the command line or Visual Studio packaging is less painful once you get it set up.3. run the analyzer early the MSIX Packaging Tool has a validation pass before signing and uploading. running that more often can help catch the filename issues before you get deep into the workflow.4. use the Windows App Cert Kit often it gives clearer errors than the packaging tool itself. not perfect, but better than “something somewhere is wrong, good luck.”5. don’t be afraid to lean on the store submission support they actually respond and can look at what the logs are trying (and failing) to tell you.none of that makes the tool magically good, but it gives you a bit more control over the chaos.",

You can sorta code with \"responsive HTML\" that adjusts itself to the width of the screen, but that's more UI tweak than fundamental design. Use a framework/toolkit/library to help you with that. You *should* know which ones if you supposedly have HTML/CSS/JS experience. So, how would you design a calendar app? It's just a database with UI. So you need some sort of database backend. Pick one that fits your needs. (Complicated: Firebase. Simple as heck: SQLite)Then you need some sort of middleware linking database to the UI. That's what you program the \"webapp\" in. And you need to learn THAT. The combination of database and middleware and UI is sometimes called a \"web stack\". For example, the MERN stack is MongoDB as database, Express.js and Node.js as Middleware, and React for UI. No, not suggesting that. It's too complicated for your needs. Figure out the right stack for your project is YOUR responsibility. How would an app send you message? Well... WHAT TYPE of message? Text Message cost money, notifications don't, but routing it to yourself requires going through some sort of OS API. Again, your own research. Yes, I've kept things vague for a reason. I want YOU to finish the research. I merely gave you some ideas to get started.EDIT: If you still don't quite get it, I want you to NAIL DOWN the requirements first. Right now, your requirement is kinda vague. Write the requirements down, into a requirement document. You need it written down and set in stone (well, mostly) before you start. Else, you'll suffer \"feature creep\". THEN you think about HOW TO MEET the requirements with your design, BEFORE you start coding. Once you have the design and architecture of your app down, THEN you start picking it apart, and code it piece by piece. (and test piece and piece if you can).

I do again want to stress that this doesn’t limit someone to only making requests from the extension, someone could just as easily make HTTP requests and include the auth token and pretend they’re using the extension. The point of the authentication layer is that every request is now tied to a user which prevents bots from just spam requesting and lets you ban abusive accounts. You should also likely have some form of IP blacklisting to ban suspicious IPs, for your case where this is just a chrome extension it makes sense to also preemptively ban the IP blocks used by the major cloud providers, regular users won’t be using those and it’ll ban bots that are running on servers hosted by them.",

There's many advantages to this actually, with the biggest one being exams. In the UK for instance, there's many exam boards such as OCR, AQA or Edexcel who ask pupils to handwrite code on paper. From personal experience, it was such a false boost of confidence because you never knew if you actually wrote it syntactically correct- now some people may argue why not just type it up after, but if I had to do this for each indivdiual question over the many many years of coding on paper- it would be a waste of time hence, I built this app to bridge a gap.I hope this answers your question! :)",

If the user needs to create a shortcut to the mobile website on their phone's home screen so it looks like an installed app, you can put instructions on how to do that on your mobile website. That's what I did on the mobile website I built: https://sea-air-towers.herokuapp.com/mobile-app-shortcut :backhand_index_pointing_up_medium-light_skin_tone: That mobile website works on both desktop and mobile phone. No need to have an Android app in Kotlin, an iPhone app in Swift, and also a desktop website. One thing works across all platforms. Less work. Also, the user doesn't have to wait a while to install something from the app store the first time they use it. But yeah, I personally generally only need something to be a mobile app when it has like 3D graphics, like a videogame. If it's just pages and text a mobile website works fine. As another person said, if you really, really need a mobile app that you download and install from your phone's app store, you can use Apache Cordova after you built the mobile website and just plug your existing website code (HTML, CSS JavaScript) into Apache Cordova. Heck, you might even be able to get away with just a Progressive Web App (a PWA). See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app",

So in general it’s good to keep them separate.That said, there are tools that integrate a language and GUI framework pretty seamlessly, and languages that are meant only for use within a particular platform. Logo defines its own drawing environment and has a lot of built-in drawing functions. HyperTalk (from the late-80’s) was meant mainly for defining UI within the HyperCard environment. Visual Basic was very Windows-specific and integrated with a GUI editor.If Kotlin was recommended for your project, use it. It’s a good model for how most GUI programming is done.",

They aren't built into a language because many programming languages are intended to be available to write programs for more than one OS/platform, and including a GUI library would make the language's library quite large. GUIs for the various operating systems can also behave significantly differently, with different philosophies, so making a standard GUI library that works with everything would be fairly complex and not very practical.Some developers write command-line applications (without a GUI), so for those reasons, language designers typically choose not to include GUI capabilities directly in a programming language.",

Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer. Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.There will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.Libraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.So most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...Then different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. Declarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML. A UI is basically a hierarchy of components, and a declarative language like HTML is a perfect way to declare or describe the UI.For this reason, most development stacks involve one language for processing, and another declarative language for the GUI part",

If you don’t like asking for help, ask your manager, if you can have a weekly meeting with a “mentor”, to make sure you are understanding the code base and on the right track. This is what I did earlier on in my career.> After three years I know almost nothing. Unless you spent three years learning about this exact problem with this exact codebase, you are likely perfectly fine. > I’m wondering when they will fire me.If you don’t speak up and show you are trying, it will look like you aren’t working. Better to get ahead of it and be proactive. If fact this might even be praised. Be shamelessly curious at the start of a new position. Now some personal advice, if you are asking for help, bring a list of what you have tried and what you think you need to do. Makes it seem like you are genuinely trying and not asking to just be walked through something. Senior developers generally don’t like holding your hand through every step of a process if you haven’t tried.

Your studies WILL continue while working. It is okay to ask questions. But then first make effort on your own, read documentation, read completed Jira tasks, read the code, google stuff. When stuff does not work then be ready to tell what you tried, what did not work, and where do you think the problem is or where the problem for sure is NOT.b)You applied to a job position that does not match with your skills and knowledge. Getting a degree or a diploma does not mean that every job is for you. I have been in the industry for quite many years. But it does not mean that I could pick any job. Even not every entry level job is for me because the tech stack is completely something else than what I studied. For example I can't write stuff in C++ or in C# because I never studied it. I will be able to read it and perhaps try something with trial and error, but I would not be suitable even to work as a junior C++ developer. But if the job would be for a senior Java developer then that would be suitable for me as I know Java.In that case you should either learn on the go to survive your current position or face the reality and pick a suitable company.c)You cheated through your IT studies or were lazy. Having a degree or a diploma does not automatically guarantee that one is suitable for the job. In that case better leave the job and learn until you get to the expected level that your diploma or a degree should represent.So, based on a), b), and c) you can decide how to proceed. Either it is fine to not know stuff and you should ask others, or you might be either in a wrong company or even should not have applied to a job, yet.",

If you use AI last, that's fine. But it is very important for you to not use AI as much as possible as early as possible as it sounds like you're just learning Java for college.I suggest that you review the fundamentals again. You can even use AI to create a guideline for you. Just double check its output for accuracy. Then you learn how to debug. Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc. You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go \"wait, why is it done this way instead of this?\".Also I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities. I don't really know any Discord communities, but I know Java enough, so feel free to ask me questions in the DMs. I'm good to help whenever I'm available.",

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.Any programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable. However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.While an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find. Fixing code is something an AI does far less well. They will, of course, offer suggestions with complete confidence; which is kind of worse.Computer generated code has always sucked. Now it's more clever about it, but a human can still put the bots to shame.A \"better program\" is also rather subjective. Do you want clearer, faster, or smaller, all of which tend to fight against each other. It should be what you think is better.

During my first master's degree, I noticed that I had lost my ability to manipulate things in my mind and got back to chess for that reason. It improved significantly for things outside of chess. I'm not saying you should start practicing calculation in chess, I'm just saying that this is trainable, so it will come over time. > My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example \"// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects_' from rect_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data\" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what. You should have better variable name then. The variable, function and method names should ideally be clear enough that you can read the code and understand what it does, what each thing contains. > To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the \"concurrent logic buffer\" size in my head. I don't know this method nor its goal. But if you are doing it just for the reasons mentioned in this topic, it's a waste of time imo. - Be more dilligent with your variable names and code structure. Do not hesitate to break down things into smaller functions that you reuse (one benefit of a very small function is that you can wrap a few lines of code into a single function call. That function name can then be explicit about what that part does, making the whole code more readable). - Things will come with practice. Don't think of yourself as unable, or dumb, or whatever. It will come, just keep practicing and learning and doing, make your own life easy when you can (for example, good variable names, again, is a way to make your life easy). You're fine and you'll be fine.",

The front end's entire existence is built upon what your back end provides it. You will need to make available what the front end needs, which often involves knowing a decent amount about front end development. E.g. You're working with a server-rendered app and the front end suddenly needs some back end data globally available. You *could* create an endpoint and have the front end devs request the data from the back end when the JS runs. But... you just sent the page to the client, and it's a single context, right? So you could just render some JS into the page to define some global data, avoiding the unnecessary round trip, and tell front end devs they have the data already. (I'm not saying this matters per se, just an example of some knowledge of front end helping you make a back end decision. There might be reasons you *want* an endpoint instead).",

I don’t care if a backend dev knows the intricacies of flex box or what browsers css-grid works in, they should know that giving the UI a huge garbled mess, and telling them to just sort and filter it all out in the UI, that’s not only a jerk thing to do, it’s MUCH slower to do almost any of that in a browser on a 5 year old phone than to just do it on the server (could also be a vulnerability based on what it is).As another person said however: if you do have to make a change in the UI, you should know what you’re doing, within reason. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you may screw things up and make the other devs mad at you and please don’t do that. You’re supposed to be a team. If you need help, always ask.

It's basically like shooting a laser in some direction and checking if it hit anything. You can try very much simplified version of it by just making some red and blue lines come out of the specific sides of the character and maybe 1 or 2 a bit forward. There might also be some other approaches.I think your code can be improved upon very much, but game development is also about designing not just coding. You can try different approaches without touching the code much.",

If just looking directly at the requirement, it seems like the minimum parameters would be the item number and location to be delivered to. It does make sense to also parameterize the \"1 hour\" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.I think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters. They could even be nested as filters to make it explicit. Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.I would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.Since it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in. Since the requirement is so open-ended, I would just assume the user has an item ID, unless there's some reason to think they don't. If you don't have an item ID I'd change the end-point to /items and add a search query parameter.",

Where does that leave us?Maybe `GET items/{itemId}/availabilities?deliverTo={}&maxTime={}`?The `Availability` entity could include things like Time, Center, etc.> do you think it is okay if we require the user to provide IDs of the entity they are seeking as query parameters?Yes it's expected that they would know the id of the item that they need more information about",

I mostly agree with you but having been in the industry a bit longer, maybe I can offer some perspective.- \"more than a year\" is not that long, especially to see the fruits of your hard work learning the trade. I think it's pretty normal for it to be overwhelming in the beginning, too.- don't stop learning new technologies just because there are new ones coming out every other week. The opportunity cost of switching technologies is pretty high for a company (depending on how deeply integrated it is) so chances are in your career you will sometimes work on stuff that is not bleeding-edge, and having learned a varied set of tools is likely to be if use eventually. Not to mention you will start seeing patterns at some point, which will make you grow as a dev- AI: sure this is transforming the profession in many ways, but try not to over-rely on it as a junior. Some things have to be learnt the hard way. Never keep going if you don't understand what you're doing. It's fine if it's AI or not your idea, but take the time to understand it first. Challenge it if you can. Also yes, many investors and execs would love to completely replace developers with AI, and this is making the market more difficult for junior developers. But if we want seniors tomorrow we need to train juniors today. I mean not everybody agrees with this but it is an argument worth making in my opinion (in interviews, etc)Anyway I hope this helps. This is just my two cents, I'm sure others will have other ideas",

One type of data hat you need to store is posts. Another type of data is user settings, including friend lists and privacy settings.Let's imagine user A is being harassed by user B. User A first removes user B from their friends list, and then makes a private post to their friends about the harassment. Those two separate operations involve separate writes to the database, involving data which is likely to be in separate shards. If the database doesn't guarantee that writes are seen in a consistent order, then it's possible that when user B opens their dashboard, the webapp reads from the database and sees the post but not the friends list change. That means B will see the post that was supposed to be hidden from them.Or as another example, consider a storefront with a webapp that writes orders to a DB, and a fulfillment system that reads orders from the DB. If the DB doesn't guarantee consistency, then it's possible that the fulfillment system might see data in one shard saying that an order is in the \"ready for shipment\" status, but data in the other shards about the items to be shipped might be in an inconsistent state that doesn't match what the user saw when the order was placed. Or maybe there was only one item left in stock, and two different users both placed an order for it, but one of them was seeing stale, inconsistent data. So you incorrectly charged two people for the same thing, and you have to detect the situation and refund one of them.These are just a couple of examples of how things can go wrong without consistency. The exact details of the failures will depend on exactly how the system is implemented. You can also have similar issues with replication, when different replicas of the same data item get out of sync.",

Unreal Engine uses C++ which tends to be a bit hard for beginners to grasp. Unity uses C# which can be easier.However, in general game dev can be really hard to grasp if you have no programming experience ie. Learning game dev and learning programming at the same time can be tough. So I’d suggest first starting out learning the basics of your language of choice and general coding techniques before jumping into any of the game engines.",

Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.But.I have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.This sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.Figuring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs. Coordinating with other folks on the team.To get good at that, you need practice, and you need to write stuff yourself, and you need to see it fail yourself. I don't think it's going to actually replace me or you any time soon. I could be wrong, I wouldn't mind retiring early lol. So far, it's been years of threatening to take my job, but no real progress towards that goal.The job market is tough right now and companies are blaming AI for layoffs they would have carried out regardless. Tough hiring market at the same time as AI does not mean one caused the other. And so far the companies that actually did lay people off to replace them with AI have ... re-hired everyone a few weeks later.",

        "body": "A CS degree has always been useless to the industry. Most are just a promise that someone has touched upon basic data structures, algorithms, database concepts, and programming in one or two languages.It doesn’t guarantee they write good code, maintainable code, performant code, or code that even meets requirements. It doesn’t guarantee they can design a database schema or design a system, or even that they understand what a message broker and event streaming platforms are, much less how they fit into a system.It’s always been like this, though, and AI hasn’t really changed anything about that dynamic. Sure, I can design a spec and pop it in the magic Copilot machine and get code that’s close to correct, but I still have to spend time paying attention to what it’s doing and checking its output, while with most junior engineers I can reasonably expect after the first couple months of their career that they didn’t just hand me a pile of dog shit that appears to do what the requirements are asking, but actually falls apart the second I run or test it.For now, it’s just a shit economy, and hiring is going as you’d expect it to in a shit economy. In addition to that, software engineering is no longer the golden ticket everyone acted like it was in the 2010s to the early 2020s. More people have been trying to enter that career, and demand has not kept up.Combine this with a shit economy and it’s no wonder most CS grads are doing anything but software right now.",

If I think of the last 25 years, we're in a bad era right now, and people who have only been in the industry the last 5 years don't have the context.2000-2001: End of Dot Com mania2001-2003: Black hole of jobs2004-2006: Slow, steady rise2006-2008: A lot of startups founded in this era, lot of hiring2008-2010: Job growth frozen. Mobile and smartphones saved the industry in 2010 as it proliferated2011-2014: Average market. Cautious employers.2015-2019: Good times and coddling.2020-2022: COVID layoffs and immediate hiring boom2023-2024: Constant layoffs2025: No-growth market similar to 2008-2010.So, by my measure, of those 25 years, about 17 were good, but it's heavily cyclical.However, if you've only been in the industry for 5 years, you see a much bleaker view of 2/5 good years.",

At the biggest company I ever worked, one team would scream about day for day shifts in deadline if I delivered late, and also wouldn’t take bugfix releases until they found a problem and then they would cry that they were blocked. For two and a half quarters, they would find bugs in the code six weeks after I or another team had already identified the bug and I had fixed it. A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. They did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix. I think we ended up with a 1:11 ratio. By then the API was fixed and the test coverage was high so it was mostly performance or security fixes. Eventually everyone in my division caught on to what a clown car they were. Lots of eye contact and eye rolling during project status conference calls",

Use chatgpt to help you write a base one and then use it some more to tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific opening. They likely are using AI tools to scan your resume so fight AI with AI.-Apply for hybrid positions. There's too much competition for remote jobs. You are competing with the whole country and possibly the world. -Use your network. Ask literally anyone you know. You never know who has a connection. The guitarist in my band works as an accountant for a financial accounting company who develops all their software in house. He ended up being my referral and I would never have known about this company otherwise. And he obviously isn't a developer or technical at all.-Be confident in your interviews. Let your personality come out. You don't need to know all the answers but you can always draw on past experiences to at least relate to -I didn't do any leetcode (or any coding at all) and was mostly asked about my skills, history, projects, and experience. Idk if I got lucky or because it was a senior position or what. But anyway make sure you can tell your story and sell yourself. -Don't forget the interview goes both ways. Think of some questions to ask about the team or the company and flip the script on them. Make them sell to you. It's an old sales tactic. At the very least you'll have more information on where you are potentially going to work and if it's really the opportunity you want. A good interview should feel more like a conversation than a grilling. I walked away from a couple of companies just because I didn't like how they were conducting things (showing up late, acting kinda adversarial, etc). Anyway it's your interview too.Idk. Your mileage may vary, but I didn't have a problem finding a job. I didn't really see what everyone was saying with the bad market out there and everything. I never would have known the market was supposed to be bad if I haven't been on the Internet. I ended up beating recruiters away with sticks toward the end of it.Good luck!",

I think almost all of the 'Application' startups will fail, same as it ever was. Most of the 'Providers' are overspending and won't see the return from their spending.

Many get trapped in a filter bubble and think everyone loves tech and they’re doing something special for the world. It’s almost kind of cult like. People who become skeptical of tech usually have broader social circles I’ve noticed. Many of my friends have burned out from tech in the past few years and had to discover themselves. Even those still working in tech seem broadly indifferent I’d recommend getting a job at a medium sized company making a very practical product. Basically something you can explain to a non technical stranger with a quick sentence. “I make an app for selling movie tickets” or something.

At medium to larger size orgs there tends to be a split after senior where you decide to either continue advancing as an IC (with titles like staff, principal, architect) or go into management (with titles like manager, director, senior director, VP, CTO). As a result staff or principal engineer wouldn't be considered management. As these titles are in the IC track. This can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\\> my manager keeps saying i'm \"operating at the next level\" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.You will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.If you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what \"strategic thinking\", \"broader impact\" and \"working on communication\" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing \"strategic thinking\". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s. Sometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.It should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.Lastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people. Some of those people have been laid off from major companies. You really need to stand out.",

It’s a topic that is very challenging to offer “general” advice on.If you haven’t read Will Larson’s book on the topic, I highly recommend it:https://staffeng.com/book/Suggest your current manager read it as well. It may help the conversations to be less “vague”. Frankly, if your manager is unwilling to read the book, or any book on the topic, it’s very unlikely you will find an internal staff+ position. You’re going to need someone in your corner, vouching for you regularly, and coaching you regularly on how to get to the next level.One thing to consider is not every engineer becomes a staff+ engineer.

I don’t know your work in detail, but I would guess a more direct version of what they were trying to say is something like:* “Yes, you make good technical decisions, but you need to also think about the strategic questions of what technical problems we should solve and how much time we should take to solve them.”* “Is your impact limited just to the stuff you personally work on, or does your presence actively make things better for the rest of the team?”* “Do you translate your complex system designs into simple principles that the team can understand and work with? Do teammates consistently talk to you or read your docs and walk away happy that it was you on the other side of the table?”",

Also, you might want to think critically about what might be happening socially after you get past the tech interview stage at the external jobs. You are getting the interviews and doing well at the tech stage. Other people are beating you on the other stuff. My one suggestion is to keep things very positive, like don’t say anything negative about anything - and focus on the leadership things you have done and what you like about them. Even if you are most proud of your technical achievements it should essentially be 20% how much of a tech badass you are and 80% rejiggering the story about that one time you were a senior on a project and how it shows you can lead.Also, have you explored the feedback at your current work? “Need to work on communication” is somewhat pointed and specific feedback for someone applying to leadership roles.",

But their job is also incredibly easy to have done anywhere else in the world and the rest of the world now has reasonably talented programmers unlike a few years ago where there was a significant skill gap in most cases.

The thought was if I'm already working crazy hours, I might as well get paid more. Then my old utility field started blowing up due to electrification of everything and I received multiple offers on linkedIn for 40-50% pay bumps (after a 2 year stint not working while going back to school). Left my CS program with about a year left due to class timings and now I have a great work life balance, much higher pay, fully remote and I can use the programming skills I developed to automate a lot of my current work load. Ended up working out well for me. For those that are curious, the utility industry is a good place to be right now. Whether that's Civil/Electrical/Mechanical or even some CS cyber security degrees.

The problem was that the intended way of using a library scaffolding tool was to properly design a schema, but nobody did that and instead used a escape hatch feature of the scaffolding tool to blindly autogenerate a naive API, and the implementation caused all sorts of problems for the \\~300 services that used these bad libraries. And to make things worse, this was a \"cancerous\" type of technical debt, aka the number of bad libraries kept growing over time because people kept using the scaffolding tool the wrong way to create more and more bad libraries.Fixing it was a colossal effort, involving a lot of automation to do the migration heavy lifting and also a lot of manual code changes and manual testing, impacting a ton of teams.

That saved a large multimillion dollar customer which the company relied upon who was threatening to leave. I never got it clean, but I got it surrounded by e2e tests so the weekly fires stopped and was able to rip out some of the worse shit buried in the guts of the stack before leaving. That job was a trial by fire and I havent learned as much before or since.In neither case were these achievements strongly recognized by the company in question - technical debt is a very abstract thing and management usually cant connect the disasters to the debt or the successes to the clean code.However, lots of hiring managers *loved* these stories.

The second thing, was exposure to SWE systems ideas, networking, distributed systems, compilers, embedded systems: just he distributed systems knowledge alone has made a huge difference.That said, if I spent the same amount of time (more than 2000 hours) doing projects? I probably would have learned more. The only issue with that, is that the courses push you further than what you might do on your own. For instance, I'm still learning CS, ML, and math concepts, I'm just not spending 20 hours a week on it.One additional point: I already was a PhD dropout when I got my MS CS, so I had research exposure, knew how to make arguments with data, and didn't really need help with research or academic skills, it was really the content that helped the most.",

Some companies will give you RSU refreshers.- Stock performance: consider up(down) side of each company. Not as important for early career, but it can significant affect TC.- Atlassian is down nearly 40% in 1 year. Hypothetically, If you join and stock price rebounds to 1 year ago price, then it is 60+% upside. In that case, your RSU may be worth 40k per year instead of 25k.

Here’s my story navigating this in the last year:Personally, I successfully did a counter offer with my firm (very large). I had to show my offer letter to confirm the number and had to basically do a review to ‘justify’ it, but not only am I still here, I even switched teams with no issues internally. The external offer I received came from a position I was reached out to about on LinkedIn, and I took the interview as practice to make sure I’m on top of my interviewing skills and be on top of any subjects or topics relevant. It was NOT to leave. However, the offer I did end up getting was too good to pass up, and I would have been an idiot to pass on it. I was open about this to my manager - I didn’t want to leave, but I’d be an idiot to say no - and they wanted to keep me enough that they worked with me to get a counter. The counter almost completely matched it, and I’m having a good time where I’m at.I don’t know if I’m the exception, but hopefully that helps. Honesty paid off here the most for me personally, but just remember that no matter what, you’re taking a risk if you accept the counter offer. I’d be prepared for anything.",

The somewhat useful AI tools automate many redundant tasks and we no longer need multiple code monkey junior devs to come in and just type away messy code or slow senior devs down with junior hires that are not high agency (self-starters).Hiring will someday pick up, but expectations for junior dev is no longer the “just be curious and we will spend ~6 months or so getting you trained up for your first contribution”. We need you to have your hands in the code within the first 2 months and get some contributions out.You will still get help but that means your fundamentals are strong (DSA) and you have some specialized knowledge you get from digging deep into a problem space (web optimization, computer vision, hardware acceleration).Find that niche and see which companies work in those field and target apply mid-level/senior roles (which usually have more specific job descriptions) and also their general entry level roles. Companies still struggle finding good hires that know a specific problem space so they would usually go for a new grad with a specific understanding in their problem space than a 3-5 YOE that knows nothing about it. And usually the senior roles are up for longer because all the applicants have no depth in their understanding in the problem space the company is hiring for.tl;dr hiring change is permanent, junior hires have to be self starters, be passionate about a problem space and apply to specific roles not spray n pray.",

There’s limited real desire and opportunity to get to those levels.To be a “true” senior you need to be leading the team and product in all technical aspects, training others, and being “the man” on the team. That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.Most teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.To be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.I quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title. So I wanted the focus to be on what the general-ish expectation is at each level.",

If you are hoping to get into newgrad/intern SWE pipelines through the program, it will give you near 0 value.Despite the hate for recruiters here, they are not complete morons. It is the most widely known MSCS program, because of its great price and typical program ranking. Many recruiters are aware of the lax acceptance rates (reported to be +80%) and that it is essentially a degree mill. There are many folks with near limited CS experience who have taken a couple of cc courses and enrolled within the program with hopes of breaking into the industry, slapping on the school name onto their resumes.It is certainly cheap enough for a try, especially when the closest alternative is an overpriced bootcamp. How many GATech MSCS resumes (online part omitted of course) do you think recruiters see nowadays? There are plenty of people straight up spamming applications with GATech MSCS on their resume without even having taken a single course yet.",

You're not them, you can make the sacrifice that others wish they could make.Alternatively, you can also consider fields outside of CS, like a civil engineering master's, electrical engineering, computational biology, chemical engineering, or even law school to pursue tech patent law (most patent lawyers studied stem, not pre law), etc etc. tons of fields. I know for a fact that some law offices will even pay for your law school while you work as an assistant if you commit to working as a patent lawyer for them for X amount of time after graduation.Avoid the shit CS job market entirely because you're still young.

IME, most of your classmates will be working full-time, but there are definitely people who are able to leverage their student status to get new grad internships.

We just haven't focused on it as much but this is one of those \"what is the price of progress?\" questions. At its most ideal we do it to free people up to do better things or be productive in other ways, but I think we (collectively) tend to cast a very dark shadow on it because it's easier to blame something rather than take it as a reason to improve other things.> Aerospace: Space is cool as fuck but Elon and Bezos are certifiably insane.They are the poster manchildren of modern aerospace, but there are many 'boring' companies involved in aerospace stuff (Lockheed, Boeing, Airbus, GE, etc.).

Most graduates who can actually build something from my school do not have issues landing jobs. Is it their dream job out of college? Most likely not, but most start out between $63K and $90K.

This should get you pretty far.If your preferred field is something like SWE, really hone in on programming through building up projects and software, even if it's by starting off with cloning things. You can even start learning right now. Do a little bit every day beyond what your curriculum is teaching, even if it's like 30m to an hour. Try to get internships as early as your first year (even if you don't know anything). It's okay if you don't get any or fail interviews, because that in itself is valuable experience. You can learn what to do and how to rework your processes.As long as you're making moves beyond the curriculum, you should be pretty set.

Sometimes be careful what you wish for. I worked 50-60 hours weekly for a few years and still felt like it wasnt enough. Im not saying this will be your experience, but again you are running the risk that you may end up in a really toxic team as opposed to a team where you know the work and have some repoitoire with the team. If you are going to risk it, do it for a job that will pay you life changing money in a way. 10% for me isnt life changing especially in this career. Put it like this, if you make 80k a year 88k isnt that much of a difference. If you make 150k a year, 165k isnt that much of a difference. It's extra money to play with or invest but again, is it enough for you to risk maybe the next few years being hectic and stressful?

If you believe you are experiencing WLB (Keep it to yourself and please do not broadcast your great manager to bad managers) and treat it as just a temporary hallucination that you are experiencing that will fade away soon to those not in the know.Now with that in mind there are some really great managers in the company that actually do try, keyword being try to establish a real work life balance within reason. Unless this is being pushed from the L8 and L10 levels it will be very hard to sustain long term by an L7 as they all eventually fold under the executive pressure cooker as they try to make it to L8 themselves. Only then can they and do they have real power to enforce WLB in their org.For yourself you will need to set hard boundaries and never become a yes person for too long or you will be crushed due to taking on more work than you can actually do. I've seen it happen so many times with the courageous happy faced yes people, then 3-6 months in they are burnt out and depressed because they are way overdue on their projects that they agreed to do and management is holding them hard accountable for it due to work being in motion. You let things slip then you get dinged for bias for action, ownership, and deliver results which massively dings your ratings (max HV1, maybe LE) then if it happens again in the next quarter you are put in focus, pivot, and then your done for.So if you want to flip the coin, do it for the work experience.

And yet, somehow, people STILL think that tech is in high demand and there is a shortage of developers.It is once you've got > 7 years of experience. There is an almost absurd glut of junior developers though.It's a weird situation because senior devs have to be juniors first and most companies don't want a junior dev. Yet they keep complaining about a lack of devs and so people train to become junior devs.Senior wages might be dragged down too eventually as those people who started off earning £20k in 2025 (seriously wtf...) eventually get enough experience to start competing with people earning £80k. Their expectations will be \\*vastly\\* reduced if they started off earning less than a truck driver.",

They are very different jobs and as a staff the expectation is that you will grow the seniors around you, so you need a good senior resume to lean on.A good, very high level distinction is that engineers below staff tend to focus on how they're going to do something. Staff and above focus more on why.As a staff, it's my job to become deeply intimate and opinionated with the product or platform I am paid to improve, as well my company's technical roadmap. From there, I need to form solid business cases as to what technical work is most important for my team, defend those with SLT or C-suite leadership, and then set up my seniors for success in the execution of that roadmap.As a senior, it's your job to become deeply intimate and opinionated on the problem that's put in front of you, likely a project from your staff dev or manager. The business case is already made at that point, and your staff dev has likely proven the case with a poc of some sort, so you need to lead the execution of the solution. Become an expert in leading solutions E2E as a senior. Then shadow your staff as much as you can to start understanding their world and responsibilities. If I can be frank, going from senior to staff in 1.5 years is extremely tight. Most companies are going to want you to have much more experience as a high performing senior before they give you this position. Be ready to not be ready in 1.5 years is advice I think you should hear now.",

They have plenty of time to exercise, but they would rather play video games.

This is generally not a yearly thing, but a once every X number of years type of thing at companies that will accommodate you.The flexibility at many companies comes at the day to day level where you need to leave early to go to pick up your kids or go to a doctors appointment type of thing.",

The traditional way to go about a job search is to double down on your strengths so that you look competitive in comparison with your immediate peers.There's something to be said about adjacent skillsets as an augmentation of your core skills, but \"from admin stuff to IT\" seems a bit too far off. Ideally, you'd target skillsets that complement what you're already good at in some way that bridges gaps in requirements from job postings in your area of expertise.",

        "body": "Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.Candidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.Key skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.I'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.Edit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint. Any decent engineer should be able to integrate an LLM into the broader system with some thoughtful design and extensive testing.",

The last project did involve a bit of AI and I picked up some skills in AWS too, basically deployed an enterprise level application. But this is a one-off project.With what I learned at work, I feel doing a startup involving AI can actually boost my experience in this area. Obviously if it takes off that's resume gold, but even if it doesn't, the upskilling and building something should \"cover the gap\" to a point where it won't hurt me. I got a co-founder friend who is a consultant and he's got some pretty good ideas involving LLMs.I've been job searching for a month targeting remote roles which makes it tougher. Got about 4% callback rate. In the future I won't need the role to be remote which should make it easier (along with the experience I gain being the lead engineer at the startup.

If it's more than a 5 minute ask, put up a calendar invite. Look up the Pomodoro technique. Keep in mind these quick changes affect our neurotypical colleges as well. It's worse for us but they aren't immune. Context switching hurts. As to the workflow change issue: yeah some migrations will have you jumping backwards and forwards when things aren't working properly. You have to roll with the punches, in the 4 years I've been in my team I've had: 4 pipeline migrations, three changes to our observability stack, one cloud migration, and a DB migration.

Not to mention if you wanted to pick up some tasks in the other tech stack, you always had the option to do so. Overall though, it's hard to say if just specializing in one platform will be an issue, given how relatively young the mobile field is (what is it, like 15ish years now?). However I do know many devs that have specialized purely in mobile across the last decade and seem to be doing well. It is probably a good idea to branch out eventually into a T-shape skillset though",

Although some interview questions lend themselves to specific architectures, we don't necessarily ask you to design systems with anything in particular, you're supposed to put your best foot forward and design a system that makes sense given the requirements.Prep guides love to tell you to list FRs and NFRs and put an api gateway in the middle of the fucking diagram etc etc, but you'd be surprised at how frequently people don't actually know what they're talking about beyond the initial keyword vomit. Getting caught bullshitting is an easy way to get disqualified.I usually ask people to sketch out the system end to end, and then dive deep on some area. Frontend folks sometimes treat the entire backend as a black box, and we focus on frontend things, up to API layer. But not always. There are plenty that can speak backend too, to varying degrees.Often it depends on the specific requirements for the job. Some teams want a strong frontend expert, others want someone who's more full stack. General bar for us is \"we want a software engineer, not a react dev\". Mind you, also, this is for high pay roles. Other companies with lower pay bands often have easier bars, especially for frontend, whose interviewers tend to not be as strong in full stack, end-to-end system design themselves (not throwing shade at anyone, just my observation from having spent a lot of time in this space).",

You have no demands and expectations. No nothing.

If you write terrible code and still manage to retain users, that's still something. Project vision is almost entirely worthless. I make good money working on a silly little CRUD app. I would love it if my company took it further and developed some sort of vision - but we have users, we are profitable and I can pay my bills. Even if we had a vision, it would still be worthless if we didn't actually manage to build it.>Would getting a certain number of high quality daily users make a difference… I ask because I personally see the value in targeted ads to doctors plus the data I would have from their use( it’s all HIPAA compliant).If all of that works, why would you be looking for a job?

If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.That's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. Now, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall \"how will this person do at this job\", they miss a big chunk of it.When I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. I think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",

So, I have around 15 users at the moment all in one speciality, in one hospital. I'm expanding on 4 other hospitals at the moment because of my wife's connections and friends etc. They will also be in oncology. Each site will probably take me a day or two of data work to be ready to go. Then I am going to get started with cardiologists at her hospital. I don't have revenue worth speaking of, no... I'm still testing it. If I were to monetize it, I think I would go with ads that target doctors while i grow it. Single small ads for expensive cancer treatments, devices, conferences, studies etc. I haven't gotten that far yet. I have a big advantage with her to constantly bounce ideas off and to teach me exactly how this all works and what they need... plus her network of doctors. I'm trying to utilize each angle I have. I would be looking for a job because, well, why not? I am going to keep on working on this full-time but I can send out applications at the same time.",

Knowing Java and Jmeter, at least last time I checked, was *really good* in some niche situations if you needed to validate data being put into a SQL database. Like, one of the best tools I've ever found for specifically that, which is weird since it's nominally a load testing tool. It's was also surprisingly easy to write your own plugins. That was a few years ago now, though, so I don't know if anything better has come along in the mean time.Knowing a bit about how http/networking works behind the scenes is also a good idea if you do any appreciable rest or network testing. If you're going to be working with that sort of thing at all you really don't want it to be just a magic black box to you. I don't see networking going anywhere either, since the cloud is a thing. I interviewed a guy for QA one time and while I was talking to him I realized that he had a fantastic amount of knowledge about networking and network protocols. I suggested hiring him based on that and told him later that he was underselling himself on his resume because no one else I'd ever interviewed had ever demonstrated the level of networking know-how that we were just casually chatting about.",

Upon graduation I was a SWE for a year before rotating to our Company's DevOps team - which is a great fit with my degree, imo. If you put in effort to specialize your course load to a specific discipline/area (i did a lot of infra, cloud, and programming courses) you can come out ready for junior roles - but often you will find yourself needing to spend extra time and effort specializing your skill set for the specific role you want to fill.",

I would argue something like:\"Developed a DAG-based AI inference engine for video analysis using Python, FastAPI, and TensorFlow for deepfake video analysis.\"is better than:\"Wrote a python backend service for a machine learning workload.\"Be specific and provide overwhelming evidence that you have done useful things. The evidence is these hyper-specific bullets. Be ready to talk in detail about everything you say you have done. It is really easy to tell when someone is talking out their ass about a resume bullet point. If the interviewer is doing their job they will ask you to get specific. Specificity, detail, depth of knowledge.The best way to get these bullet points is for every single job sit down for at least thirty minutes and just write every single technology you used and every single thing you did. Be painfully verbose in your listing of things. Once you have that you can go back and create bullets like the first one I showed you.I would focus on LinkedIn (shocker), Dice, and Indeed. Dice and LinkedIn are where most of my 'in bound prospects' come from in terms of job opportunities. Dice has actually been really great for me. Get your profile there up to date and as specific as possible.Now let us talk applications. You need to be doing hundreds per day. Don't waste time creating tailored resumes to job postings. Your resume will likely get lost in the sea of other applicants. I wish it was not this way. When I was looking for a job when I got laid off earlier this year I was doing 200-300 a day or more. You will find out eventually that most recruiters look at the new job postings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so Saturday and Sunday are GREAT days to slam job postings but you need to be ass-in-chair submitting till your fingers fall off every single day. Do as many easy applies as you can stomach then start moving toward the regular job applications. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY. It sucks, it is boring, it is a numbers game. I had 10+ interviews a WEEK for almost a month when I was doing this. It works.Have two or three references ready to go that you can submit if recruiters or job applications ask for them. Let them know you are applying to a TON of places. It speeds things up if you don't need to ask every single time.Back to the resume thing. It is a good idea to have 2-3 developer 'archetypes' you want to apply for. I have 'Full Stack Python focus', 'Full Stack TypeScript focus', and 'Full-stack AI infrastructure focus' archetypes ready to go. Then you can go to LinkedIn and type 'TypeScript Software Developer' and crank through applications.Also, I like to have at the top of my resume a little blurb that shows what I am:\"Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native Python applications to automate critical workflows in the insurance industry as well as large-scale video analysis for customer POCs, securing $10K+ MRR deals, and developing a Python-based DAG-driven AI inference engine for deepfake video analysis.\"The HR person or whoever is looking for X type of developer and if you can put that in front of them your chance of getting a callback goes way up. Do EVERYTHING you can to show them you are what they want.One more thing, on LinkedIn it is a good idea to filter by 'Jobs Posted in the last 24 hours'. I applied to some of those earlier this week and within an hour got a call from a recruiter for one of them. This has happened many times.This is how I hunt for jobs, it works for me. It is alot of work but its pretty straightforward once you have the resume and profiles ready to go. And I don't mean to be an ass by bringing this up but I make $150k a year, graduated late 2024 with my CS degree. I landed this job in a tough job market. Or, rather, I created the preconditions of job offers and was ready when they inevitably appeared. You can do this. Employment is an emergent property, like flight.",

That was back in 2018 when the market was apparently a lot better. I do find applying to jobs very tedious but I'll continue on with it. 150K is great money, congrats on landing the role. The most I've ever made was 90K. It would be amazing if I could find a job making around that same figure. I was hoping my last contract would roll over into a full time position making 160K but it didn't happen. It was with a large telecom client that you've likely heard of, it's a great company to work for but apparently very hard to land a full time position with. So alas I'm back to looking for work.

The organization as it exists in the early days (and if this is stealth I would assume it's VERY early days) is going to be very different from where it is in even a year or two. I've joined multiple startups as a employee <10 and seen them grow to 300-500 in just a couple of years. A work environment that you really enjoy in the beginning might change drastically into somewhere you don't want to be more quickly than you might imagine.A vestment schedule like that basically requires you to stay there for at LEAST 3 years (and really more 4) to see any real upside, even in the absolute best case scenario. Which: not to be a downer, but even good startups mostly fail. This startup is being unusually stingy with their equity, to a degree that strikes me as a bit silly. A startup being stealth is also almost always very silly as well, but that's a different conversation. I'm not saying don't take the job. I would just be clear eyed that you are VERY unlikely to see any significant upside from these stock options. Most experienced startup people would tell you the same.",
