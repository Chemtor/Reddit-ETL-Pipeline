The new tools built in rust, and with interoperability in mind via open formats - both storage with parquet+deltalake/iceberg and in memory with arrow - that work natively in-process with python bindings and even out-of-process, are going to be much easier to work.I've been plugging away at using daft, which can run in-process with python, or out of process on a single machine, or across a ray cluster. You can take the same code and run it in something super lightweight and then scale it out to a huge cluster. No need to change processing engines.I can see more being built around duckdb for the same purpose.I've seen someone benchmark running daft distributed within a databricks cluster and it being *faster*. That is you start up a Databricks cluster, install daft and ray, and you get better performance than the spark instances you're running alongside. At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.Spark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.These new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",

Python-first, with native wheels that don’t require external dependencies2. Works on ANY scale — effective both for a 60MB CSV as well as 100TB of Parquet/Iceberg. This means having best-in-class local as well as distributed engines3. Works on ANY modality — data today is more than just JOINs and GROUPBYs. The reality is that data is messy and unstructured!! Sometimes my UDF fails but I don’t want it to kill my entire job…We’re trying to be more public with our roadmap and stuff too so please let us know if there is interest. For instance, we will be working to reduce reliance on Ray as a hard dependency soon and enable raw Kubernetes deployments (which seems to be a common ask), and we have a Dashboard in the works (we call this Spark UI++).

Recent Java is good, cutting edge data tools like Trino are still developed with Java.I think a more important factor is distributed vs single machine processing.Given the increase of processing speed of single CPUs since the 2000' papers that gave birth to Hadoop, many workloads that required distributed processing at the time or even 10 years ago, will now fit inside a single machine. A lot of the complexity and slowness of Hadoop and Spark are due to distributed processing.

You can process arbitrarily large datasets using a standard declarative syntax and not have to worry about running out of memory. DuckDB works well for single user / single node otherwise there is a plethora of other databases available if you need distributed processing or to share amongst multiple users.Spark is overkill for most situations and even for the situations it isn't overkill for you still have to question whether you actually want to deal with it. Its slow and bloated like anything JVM based. I also find it ironic that Databricks is investing a large chunk of energy turning Spark into a SQL engine because it turns out the vast majority of data processing can be described in terms of SQL.",

I don’t need huge amounts of JVM logic that can distribute my data across 4 machines for my 100GB a day pipeline that serves a couple of dashboards.I tried duckDB it’s amazing for reading parquet and doing some transformations but what I dislike about it is you can’t leverage multithreading / multiprocessing like you can with dataframe objects (super useful when uploading lots of files to S3 etc).",

They made me do a proctored written test (weird for director level) having MCQs and also questions about designing end to end architectures for 4 use cases and few weird questions (asked to write spark configuration and write IAM policy in json) . I passed that round and in the partner round , expecting more questions on broader aspects I got rejected for not knowing the correct syntax. eg- mounting cloud object storage on databricks ( I said dbutils.mount instead of dbutils.fs.mount) . Turns out the partner does all of these stuff day in and day out and expects the same from director . So for them the director works as an IC building pipelines and there would be no scope of preparing data strategy and governance and stakeholder management until the team is built . So in short , the “director” role expectation depends on the team that is hiring .",

It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.Things like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.Just a couple of thoughts to add from experience:- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.Overall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",

And my experience with pre commit and linter has largely been negative. Documention is always extremely valuable. Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. OOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. I'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",

Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.One of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.It doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.When it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.It’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.It’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.Redshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.It’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",

The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.A huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. On the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.Personally I haven't seen any \"random errors\" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.After a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.Good engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.I know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.The biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

I would have gone with the approach of asking more about what it is and what its for then went on an approach for ingest. Do they need it realtime? Do you want to backfill and then stream from the buckets all the deltas? General how of the ingest seems ok to me but orchestration seemed missing. Also questions on what technologies they are using for current end state so you don't just drop your own tech stack if they have one already and adapt to that. I would say your answer was tailored to \"How do I feed this to an LLM\" storage setup. Which if you are storing a large number of text files is probably a pretty solid thing to do.

That’s a good point — orchestration probably would’ve helped tie everything together, especially for verifying successful transfers and setting up retries or backfills. I did ask them where this data would eventually live. They told me assume it was a database then I asked about a dashboard where I mentioned where the schema normalization would be important to make sure that on the front end you could identify specific filters to show the user (like drop downs). Also, your point about aligning with their existing tech stack is spot on. I think I got a little too caught up in the idea of feeding everything into an LLM pipeline with vectorization + embeddings. Probably came off like I was optimizing for a use case they didn’t even confirm.In hindsight, I should’ve slowed down and clarified whether they needed real-time ingestion, what the downstream usage was (e.g., dashboarding vs search vs ML), and whether historical backfill was in scope. I was so nervous lol :grinning_face_with_sweat:. Thank you for your answer",

Fix the bug and reprocess all of the raw data for that project.There's a change in schema due to evolving business requirements?

For example, all source databases should dictate anything that contains currencies and prices in float(8,2). That way, you don't feel frustrated that two columns that are topically similar (e.g. transaction fees or sales subtotal) can be calculated without some weird-ass errors due to data type mismatch.That's just **one** type of governance. There's also naming convention governance, (so you don't have one table column named \"STR_NAME\" and another named \"NAME_TXT\"). I could think of other things, but remember that you want everyone to talk to each other compatibly. The less you need to wrangle and data cleanse, the faster it is to deliver OLAPs or BI reports.",

In most cases its something I think you layer on top of your existing data skills to increase your value in the market, whether you're a data engineer, analyst, team lead, or CDO. But generally once you step into a management role, governance quickly becomes central. At that level, almost every decision touches on it in some way. And I definitely see its importance growing on a broader scale, albeit from a different than traditional point of view that there are generally much more CDO's and data leaders out there who require and need those skills or that organizations are failing in mode modern projects like AI or digital twins and learn the hard way the requirement of governance. So I guess overall its just more streamlined and integrated into broader management, data transformation, and change management efforts.To answer your question directly. Is data governance essential to land a job? I don't think so, unless you're lucky or in a specific industry. But can it significantly increase your value in a data related career? Absolutely, especially if you're entering the management area.",

Your goal is to catch changes early. 3. SaaS APIs and finance sheets will always change so treat them like untrusted user input. Assume they WILL break. 4. Build joins in a downstream layer ONLY after validation and cleansing. Default to left joins with null safe logic and then log any unmatched rows. 5. Version everything using a version control system (like most common one git). Save schema versions, your data samples, and row counts with every load. It makes it 10x easier to debug what changed and when, and you can always roll back into a version in case anything goes wrong. 6. Don't spelunk through logs, you should be able to track lineage, stats, and failures in tools like OpenLineage and your future self will thank u. 7.

Depends on how much time you have on your hands and if you expect to support many dozens, if not hundreds of layouts. Or just 7. In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout. (Layout-specific validations — discovering inconsistencies from customer-specific problems4) transform data (and/or structure) using a schema mapping. 5) Store the sanitized data in a staging area.6)Validate data in staging area (validations on sanitized data)7)Send valid staging data to prod.Such system still has limitations as I laid out above, but if you only need to consolidate behavior, you need to build a workflow that will validate data from source, transform the input to a common output to be loaded from, then validate data at this staging area to validate for the destination (prod).",

It really depends on a bunch of variables, including your stack, preferences, skill set, business requirements, etc. At my company, raw data is typically CSV files coming from outside and landing in s3, so there’s no data types. We then serialize to parquet with external tables in Redshift Spectrum, where you have some leeway with data types. We grew very quickly and had no time to properly set each dataset’s data types.

We follow the medallion architecture and first use the raw data without any processing (html files), but on the later stages we have data models to ensure data consistency. If something fails (validation error), it implies that there was a change in the source. Also cause we keep the original raw files, we do not have to re scrap from the source, we just rerun the pipeline from this particular stage As mentioned, raw data for us is unprocessed. Then they get structured based on the source schema (for every source there is a model), and the data are transformed based on the target common schema. Between the stages the data are stored as json files. However the code validates their data types, with data models (pydantic).",

You’re not starting from zero.Now it’s time to shift from learning to building especially showcase a story / impact. Courses are fine, but real traction comes when you can point to something you’ve created. Set up a public GitHub repo with two or three small but complete projects. Think end-to-end: pull in data, transform it with PySpark or dbt, orchestrate it with Airflow, push it into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake. Even if it’s basic, the fact that it works is what hiring managers want to see. Aka you are self sufficient and not to be watched but deliver results.At the same time, tighten how you talk about yourself. You’re not “catching up”—you’re evolving. Build a 60-second intro that shows you’ve worked in high-scale environments and now you’ve added modern tools to your stack. The story needs to be clear and confident.Also—don’t get stuck applying to roles blindly. Be intentional. Focus on companies in transition—those moving from legacy to cloud. Your past is an asset, not a liability. It’s not about having every shiny skill. It’s about showing you can adapt and ship. Do that, and doors will open. Keep going.

There are a lot of enterprise orgs migrating from legacy to cloud (AWS also - emr, glue for etl using Spark to redshift and aurora databases). There are ppl who know legacy tools. There are folks who know cloud. Knowing both and how the connect is a great place to be. I'd recommend learning terraform or cloud formation, as well and if you dont know it already, brush up unix skills. Good luck!",

        "body": "I see DBT as a next generation alternative to having a bunch of messy, poorly documented, and often redundant stored procedures in the database. I have seen so many databases filled with stored procedures that no one wants to touch and they aren’t being version controlled.With DBT you organize sql scripts in nice little project folders. Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.Duckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.Honestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",

But it’s not very “production-ready.”Maybe you’d end up using an orchestrator like Airflow. If you have many transforms that need to be run in order, you’ll be writing a lot of custom logic to build the DAG, handle retries of something fails, etc.dbt abstracts some of that away. It’s basically a convenience that lets you write transforms and automatically builds the DAG for you in the right order. You could use dbt to manage transforms in DuckDB just as easily as in a warehouse. The main problem with doing the transform in DuckDB and then loading to a warehouse is you have to build some process to do the loading. Are you just going to drop and rebuild every table? It’s not a deal breaker, just extra complexity you’ll have to manage.",

There is no debate on this.

Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.At well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.It is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day). So companies will prefer to hire MLEs from the pool of people with prior MLE experience, of which there is no shortage of such people on the job market looking for a role, than DEs for MLE roles.",

Eg an mle may need to bring in data for a poc the de group doesn’t have in house yet. One of the two may bring it into a dev env but when the model needs to be moved into production the de team usually take over that new data source integration and the mle works on deploying the model.

DE is generally bland work and people only tend to last a year or two before moving on.

Ask yourself what happens when the data is updated or when you need to change your website. How are you organizing your project and code?

There's a quote about writing in general - \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*\". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think \"this person is seriously experienced\" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.2. making \"hail mary\" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.Similarly for the \"there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering\" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.If you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to. For the open source projects you can contribute even if you're \"only\" writing tests, documentation etc - that's a really valuable contribution, and demonstrates some commitment and could quite easily lead to contributing fixes and features in the future.",

The job is entirely dependent on having a practical understanding of how data is consumed downstream of its production, and you just cannot have a clue if you haven't spent a few years of your life, well, consuming data.80-90% of the DEs I know have basically the same story. STEM degree(s), 2-6 YoE in Data, legitimate interest in software engineering (reading books, recreational programming, etc), makes the transition by learning the trade directly from the DEs working under the same roof. These roadmaps may give you the impression you can make the jump by learning the right tech. Learning bash, SQL and python is more like the bare minimum for most data jobs, honestly, not exactly a recipe for becoming a DE.I know the job title is pretty sexy, but trust me when I say you have no idea of what's it like.

Being able to support Spark, Pandas, Polars, Snowpark, DuckDB etc. with one API is super powerful.That said, what it’s still missing (last time I checked) is **declarative configuration** — you’d still need to build a wrapper layer around it for YAML- or metadata-driven validation flows.

Spin up a AWS glue PySpark notebook. At that point you are just using Spark to read the data in.If the data is in parquet, awswrangler has a function that allows you to read the parquet metadata which you can then turn around and use to register the table in the glue catalog.Even if it is CSV, you can always just pass all columns in as string and only convert columns you care about to appropriate data types.https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/",

It would depend on what you prefer.My preference would be to go deep as for 3 YOE you have quite a wide tech stack so becoming an expert in these technologies will take time and possibly be a good value addition for your next role.1. Definitely be an expert in Python, SQL and either Snowflake or Pyspark. This can be your core. It is a quite wide stack that will certainly get interview calls and this can become your strengths when you talk about yourself in interviews.2. DBT and Airflow can be next to master. By mastery I mean you should know what are real bugs/limitations you encountered, how you migrated across versions, how you managed deployments of 1000s of models or pipelines, etc. What works for 10 jobs rarely works for 1000s.3. For good companies data structures and algo will most likely come in picture. Be good at fundamentals around data warehousing, data modeling, data architectures. DDIA is a must read. General system design can become relevant.4. Streamlit is a very nice to have feature, not sure about job interviews but once you are in a role it will help you shine if you can demonstrate good insights from the data that you are engineering. Same applies for ML engineering.5. A good background in a database technology can also be a good thing. Postgresql has emerged as a standard but that again is going to take quite some time to master. All the best!",

Evaluate lyrics for profanity using either a local list of naughty words, or perhaps a local LLM. Local list will be muuuuch faster than any LLM.4. Store result in redis cache, with [Artist_Name]_[Song_Name] as the key and EXPLICIT/MILD/SAFE as the value.This is also a lot closer to \"real\" DE work, which is often janky.",

My boss was very impressed with this guy during the interview process, said he had a ton of contributions to open source projects and also had a lot of personal projects. He was supposed to be very experienced, and was hired for a senior role.On his first day, early morning we have a meeting to showcase the data architecture we are proposing to a big data migration we are supposed to do in a near future (migrating old legacy on-premisse ETL to something more modern on the cloud) and the guy just sits there nodding. Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says \"go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon\". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, \"maybe it's something I said?\", \"did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?\", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy. So he just basically just forked a bunch of random repos to impress some clueless recruiter and it fucking worked. The guy was a hack, probably didn't understand a word of what we said in that meeting, panicked and never came back.",

That way if you need something comprehensive you can create it as needed. If your storage is cheap you can also keep it around, but you don't want to run every single dev process at full scale.At a place I was at previously we'd essentially snapshot the prod environment in a way that we could repeatedly 'restore' it to other environments as needed. That snapshot then had transforms to cut down the data as needed into other snapshots. Want something that only targets a specific geographical area, or a particular customer segment, or product, or a random sample? Then just grab a data snapshot for that and restore it into your project.Just check the costs against your labour costs though. If it is only costing 10% of an FTE, then is it even worth messing around with it? With that cost if it would take more than 10% of someone's time in a year to set this up and maintain it, then it isn't worth changing. If your dev is costing 100% of an FTE to run on prod data rather than a cut-down version, then it is probably worth having someone spend their time on setting up that cut-down data.",

We see some people that have their system only built on Postgres / MySQL and can't do analytics queries on top of that. Those people need to introduce OLAP as part of their stack, the value prop of what we offer in that case is that we make the opinionated choices for you, the glue is built in the framework for the different pieces of the stack so you don't have to worry about that. For bigger orgs that already have something like a Databrick or a Snowflake, we see data engineering with huge backlogs that has a hard time to respond to demand for analytics. All of the data is pretty alive and fluid and what was the golden standard at day 0 is not so golden at day 100. We are trying to address that with a stack that is optimized for local quick iterations, reducing the time it takes to get something to production.I hope that helps.is your experience different? if so, how so?",

I find it particularly helpful for:* Connecting to a wide range of data sources, including APIs, databases, files, and cloud apps* Building flows visually or via JSON-based configuration* Automating scheduled jobs, such as syncing Salesforce data into SQL Server or pushing data to Snowflake* Transforming data mid-pipeline with built-in functions or custom scripts* Monitoring and alerting, which help ensure reliability without constant manual checksIt’s a versatile tool, especially when I need to support integrations across systems like PeopleSoft, Salesforce, and cloud data warehouses.",

Doesn't matter if its 10 kB of data, if that's the most important piece of data to the company, and you are responsible for maintaining it, then you have a vital role. In my experience, I've tried to get really good and efficient in the domains that I am responsible for and always find ways to improve there. I ask questions like: Can I automate this a little more? Can I add some fault handling or error handling? Can I set this up to be triggered to run instead of running on a schedule? By solving some of these questions, you allow yourself to quantify your impact to the business, which goes a long way in showcasing your skills and upgrading to a new role.I wouldn't worry too much about a particular tech or skill you don't have, because you can always try to pick them up on a personal project or training, and there's always a possibility in the future for a use case, especially if your are looking for one. The way I see it, you're already experienced in Azure, a big cloud platform. Don't sell yourself short, you might be able to make a nice lateral move to work on bigger projects.Side note, I used to work in manufacturing as well, and I sort of miss it.

Also it would require for you to go back and change previously written partitions as time goes on.The functionality more so exists so say you have a massive table where you want to “evolve” the schema and/or partition over time, you don’t have to rewrite the whole table.What you are proposing could work, but I am guessing you would be incurring some performance hits because now your query execution engine has to factor in multiple partition patterns. Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.Edit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",

It means that people that are familiar with that system can use your data platforms to get at the data they need, without having to put strain on the original source.Another thing you could do is, with the 'internal tables, if some team wants access to some state like that you just make a copy of the model and call it a published one just for that team. You should then able to make changes to the original model to suit your own needs, and they've got something stable. It does mean you might have two materialisations, and you'll have two dependencies, but it might be worth it.You still might have a bit more going on with the source-replica styled tables. People might want a history of the data in there, for example, so you might still run raw staging copies, then produce 'latest' and 'full history' representations of the data. It generally isn't hard to do both, since the latter gets you the former, so you can make it a standard that every time you ingest a new source you create these representations to provide to anyone that needs it so they can get quick access.Later down the line you'll have to grapple with data governance issues, but in a small org it can be handled more directly.",

The key to being promoted anywhere is knowing how to talk to the next levels up in a way they can relate to and feel reassured by. And particularly when dealing with non-technical leaders, they don't want to be bogged down by a lot of technical detail, it's scary and confusing to them. You think you're showing them your great technical acumen but you're just convincing them they would rather work with the other guy.

More often than not, we get so caught up under the hubris of achieving technical excellence that we forget who it's being developed for. My only thought was that it maybe slightly oversimplifies why some engineers get overlooked. The \"myth\" of focusing only on technical excellence felt a bit like a strawman – most engineers I know realize communication matters, even if they don't prioritize it enough. And promotions often involve more complex factors than just technical skill vs. relationships (like scope, leadership potential, strategic impact).But overall, a valuable perspective on needing more than just coding chops.

It’s often through teaching or explaining concepts—whether it's techniques, architectures, or tools—that they become more deeply embedded in our understanding. That said, choose the method that works best for you.Feel free to DM me—I'd be happy to share tips and resources that have helped me throughout my career. For context, I started in the computer vision field, transitioned into software back-end engineering, then worked as a data analyst, and since 2020, I've been both a Senior Data Engineer and a Solutions Architect Expert at large international companies.",

Trying to put everything at once will take you a long time and you won’t be able to validate your progress and maybe you’ll stop in the middle because it was too long and you don’t see the project ending anytime soon.First focus on ingestion.This will guide you collect data from a source and store it.You can try a couple different sources here like REST api, web sockets, MQTT topics, GraphQL API, just here you can have some fun.Do things simple, use simple python and once it’s working THEN try to improve if you want ti make it faster or what ever.Then focus on transformation Load the data from S3 to Snowflake. It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.Now configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.Then clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.Note that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. Then work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.Then focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.Then you can start looking into streaming.Configure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)Then modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.Then configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.Then try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.Then work on building beautiful dashboards.Then you can try to consolidate all pieces together.This is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want. Do small integration instead. You’ll get completion reward as you go and you will be more willing to continue instead of dropping because the scope is to complex.Cheers and good luck",

Your resume is there to illustrate your history and your accomplishments. You need to create bullet points that show numbers, that show completed things as much as possible. Your resume is meant to give the company looking to hire you an idea of what their employees can look like if they hire you, or how you can make their team better. This means that you need to tailor your cover letter and resume to the job you are applying for every single time. Yes, this is a lot of work. Yes, it's a pain in the butt to do. Yes, you should still be doing this.Please make sure you are tailoring things to your audience when you make your applications. Just because you have the titles doesn't mean that you are showing you are of value, or that you are summarizing your capabilities effectively. Dressing things up matters A LOT in these cases!",

I actually landed Unilever as a client and did 3 projects with them through the platform as a data analyst.\\- Large / corporates hire freelancers through recruiting firms. That's called contracting. Those project usually last 3-18 months and are almost always full-time. They are great to get started as a freelancer as they pay very well but you will depend on just one client. I have a community of data freelancers so I can testify that yes it's a viable career path. Enough talk. Ask me anything and I try to be transparent.This is me talking about the topic on a podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S93V8RgwBig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S93V8RgwBig)",

The benefit of SSIS is that you have full control over it - you can run it on-premises or in a private cloud. The development process is also much easier because you can develop solutions right from your notebook with no need for network connectivity. Once you pre-process your data with SSIS and perhaps store in Parquet files, you can load and do your analysis with DuckDB - it is free and very high performance.The solution I have described above will be the most cost-effective and easiest to develop and maintain.",

That being said, you might want to look into getting some kind of SA cert from one of the cloud providers. You mentioned GCP, but I wouldn’t rule out AWS or Azure. In fact, I would look to see if there are any companies trying to migrate from on-prem Oracle stacks to cloud based ones and see which cloud provider they tend to go for (I would guess Azure but that’s just a guess) and then get a cert in that. That way you can leverage your old and new skills together. Good luck.",

As a result: data quality complaints -> DE fixing bugs that DA reported -> skyrocketing cloud bills.My point is: **data accountability overlaps** for both DEs and DAs. A systematic governance framework is required in every business that assigns clear data accountability to each data role. DEs and DAs need to collaborate and answer one fundamental question first: What data product does the business need?To achieve such a goal, DEs and DAs need structured and adaptable data quality rules and to determine how to monitor and catch issues at the source. This is the critical overlap that many organizations are missing today.If you can, build a custom (homebrew) system to detect data issues early. If that's not feasible or scalable, invest in a data observability platform that meets these needs.I might have answered a bit more than you asked for, but this is a good question and I think it's worth rethinking, even for some senior DEs and DAs.",

Replicated trees had mismatching metadata with zookeeper issues, and upgrading without having reliable backups seems utterly risky. 2. This clickhouse cluster is hosted on-premise, and the disks of the server are very slow. So we decided to go for a full backup/replication solution on a new cluster. The problem is neither of clickhouse-backup nor clickhouse-copier seem to work for us, the configuration of the old clickhouse cluster is weird, and I'd rather not changing anything on that server.",

You won't be expected to hit the ground running. But if it is intense they will expect you to pick up what they saying quickly. As an entry level hire you should have a solid support in palce - don't be worried to ask questions or have to know everything. Learning about the tech stack is good but really passing the interview and landing the job you can consider yourself done until you start. You could email your new line manager and ask if there is any training or reading they would suggest before you start.",

You can still do some kind of batching to save back and forth network traffic but you can just process it individually and then do simple for loop in the batch.Besides multiprocessing is practically just spawning a sub python program, just that it is managed by the main program. Having it as a concurrent lambda pretty much equal to this without managing the multiprocess.",

Most business do not hire for someone that specialises. Being a data engineer with a lot of data ops experience will get you a long way in my experience and is probably better for your employability.Anyone else out there feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong - this is all anecdotal from my personal experience.",

        "body": "Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.Even companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!DataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible \"thing\" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:DataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.But there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.So, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract. In other case, have a good plan B. Whatever happens, good luck!",

Something that \\*could\\* be cute if your boyfriend is familiar with the signs of base64 encoding is to send him a base64 encoded message. It would only really be useful for one email but it might be cute to send him an email that says something like:I just wanted to say, SSdtIHNvIHByb3VkIG9mIHlvdQ==Which translates to I just wanted to say, I'm so proud of you.Just make sure there's the == at the end of the message to make it obvious. Base64 uses padding to make sure the content is of an appropriate length so sometimes it will end in = or ==. So if you encode it to Base64 and it doesn't have == at the end just add a space and reencode until the encoded message contains ==. You do run the risk of him not realizing what the message is though.",

It's a short read with some diagrams available -though I recently listened to the audiobook and didn't feel the missing reference images took away from the experience. The author basically starts mentioning the abacus and other early calculating machines, which leads to Babbage/Lovelace, which leads to Turing, which leads to Von Neumann, which leads to... etc etc all the way up to modern networking, cloud, and social media. It doesn't go overly in-depth into any one topic, but still explains a lot of things in a way that's easy enough to grok even without a CS background. And it's not just historical figures like a textbook, he does explain things like how vacuum tubes worked and *why* certain things developed the way they do, like how CS concepts we consider foundational today were being theorized/implemented to invent devices to accurately. Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term \"digital\", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day. Definitely recommend, especially if you like history or are a little shaky on certain CS topics. Really having a good explanation of how a vacuum tube actually works before moving onto microprocessors really helped the IRL \"tech tree\" make so much more sense to me, and now if you ask me what a microprocessor is, I won't any longer respond by saying \"idk, shit that low level is just magic to me\"",

If you don’t enjoy programming or coding (which it sounds like you may not) it’s prob best not to force it. Let things happen naturally do what interests you. If you’re not afraid of taking on some debt (which shouldn’t be too much if you go the trade school route) I think becoming an electrician could deff pay off. Don’t give up hope remember the good times and your more than just your career. Remember also. Small habits make big changes.

They are getting CS degrees and spending hours every week building things and developing their skills. They network with other developers and apply for jobs and interview constantly until they land a position. These are the people you will be competing with for any available jobs. If that sounds intimidating, or even beyond the effort you are willing to put in, then maybe being a software developer isn't your best career choice.",

Actually in my case, it was before the OG crash in 2000, but I have a 25 year career and no degree of any kind. It is \\*a lot harder\\* now. Like, orders of magnitude harder. I don't think it is impossible but you are absolutely going to have to learn how to sneak in through the backdoor. The guy who called me a clown is absolutely right (I am a clown, \\*rimshot\\*), trying to get through the typical application process is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. You have a couple of options, one of these is \"network like your life depended on it\", perhaps you can find somebody who likes you personally and wants to give you a shot. The other option is to undercut the market. Even working minimum wage is positively lucrative compared to the cost of a 3 year degree. Two or three years as the associate / coffee run kid at a cash strapped startup might give you the education to step up. It will depend on where your mind is. If you are thinking, \"can I just skip the college bit?\". Nope, not really. You might be able to replace it with something else but you are going to have to earn those stripes regardless and you are going to have to get a lot more creative if you plan to go off piste. I do enjoy reading stories of people who go this way and make it though, so best of luck and come back and tell us if it works.",

People here are saying \"no\" but it's more complicated than that on modern architecture. Yes, they can slow down your loop if the branch predictor guesses wrong, because the CPU pipeline will have to flush its pending work. But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.edit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop. Alternatively you can look into branchless programming, which usually relies on methods like boolean algebra. But don't go too deep into the world of micro-optimizations, 9/10 times it is a waste of your time unless you have definite specifications that require it.",

In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.How fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.Of course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.But in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...If you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself \"every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction\" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower. So yeah, if you're doing a loop that loops 1 billion times, and you tracked the time it took, you could probably see a noticeable difference.",

        "body": "Here's a breakdown of some good learning resources:Frontend:\\-Scrimba's frontend career path is endorsed by MDN and has a unique teaching style. Not overly comprehensive and could be great paired alongside Frontend Mentor for projects.\\-Frontend Mentor is great for practice projects.\\-The Odin Project is probably the most comprehensive resource for frontend online but its not for everyone. There is tons of reading and it takes much, much longer to complete than other souces. However, its up to date and really enforces the fundamentals. Might be best to choose another resource if your focus is backend though since this goes deeper into frontend than you'd probably need to know.\\-FreeCodeCamp launched a new curriculum recently. I haven't tried it but it looks pretty good.Backend:\\-Boot.dev is a newer resource that teaches backend fundamentals in a \"gameified\" learning experience where you earn XP from completing problems. Probably one of (if not the) best resource for learning general backend skills, my only gripe is their focus on Go. Go isn't as in demand as some other backend langauges, but they are launching a Typescript path soon for those who don't want to learn Go.\\-Hyperskill is a lesser known resource where you get lots of hands-on practice. I used this website to learn Java and I can't recommend it enough. The projects are great and after every lesson you are given plenty of practice problems. The only downside is that its a little unclear when you should start on projects and some of the practice problems pull from content you haven't learned yet but other than that its a great platform that has integration with Jetbrains IDEs.\\-The Odin Project also covers Node.js if you're interested in that. They also have a Ruby on Rails path but I wouldn't recommend it.\\-Since you mentioned C#, I've heard good things about [https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) although I haven't tried it myslef. Also Microsoft recently launched a full stack developer course on Coursera using C# for backend.Whether you want to learn frontend or backend first is really up to you, just make sure you apply your skills once you learn them with practice projects. The platforms I listed here are all really good about making you practice the skills you've learned. That's why I didn't recommend Udemy courses, because while there are some instructors that do a good job teaching, projects usually involve you just watching them code and copying what they do. I could see using Udemy for frontend paired with Frontend Mentor though, Colt Steele and Jonas Schmedtmann are probably your best bet for that. Also, I would avoid the full stack developer bootcamps on Udemy, since they are often just surface-level knowledge. Lastly, if you ever plan on getting a CS degree I would go with WGU. Very affordable university that lets you go at your own pace. You can proabably get it done in 2-3 years depending on how much time you have (I'm on track to finish in about 3 years, although I've kinda been slacking). Hope this helps!",

Your best bet falls in Webdev and maybe cyber. Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information. Python is generally recommended for beginners. I would look at JS especially the fancy frameworks like next and react and some new one that came out that probably came out as I am typing this.

Generally speaking, developing programming languages and techniques is a matter of allowing humans to express, in the ways that they think, a bunch of instructions than can be converted to the way the machine 'thinks'. Humans think in objects. There is a thing called a car. I have one. Mine is a particular colour and it can drive to places at various speeds... yada yada yada. OOP let's us express these ideas in these ways. When it comes to large, complex systems, this kind of separation and encapsulation can help tame the chaos. Over the years, I have come to accept that forcing \\*everything\\* into the object model is a mistake (as a Java guy for a couple of decades, this was a hard lesson to learn), but there are times when it is the right way to express an idea, even a very complex one. Over time and assuming the tools support it (and hopefully in 2025 they do), you just learn to combine all this stuff.",

        "body": "Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.Yet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.For me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.Think about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.Exactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.When you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.Even better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.Sure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.Reuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always \"communicates\"/\"interacts\" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",

An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can \"communicate\" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.The example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.But imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.That is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are \"communicating\" than running a procedure.Since many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is \"easy\" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program. Smaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",

        "body": "The benefits wont show up much on small single person projects over a short timespan.The essence of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.The point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.One place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.The other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.I’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting.",

Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.As a learning pattern it is something that really seems to \"click\" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things \"really exist\" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.You can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time \"Enemy\" should be a \"Unit\", but other times it should be a \"Targetable\" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.With practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.I think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",

They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.First, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.Procedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.However, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.In reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",

Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn. If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct. This is similar but not exactly akin to something like for(int \\*ip = arrayname; ip < &arrayname\\[max\\]; ip++)",

While learning, make sure to try and write your own code and develop small projects when you learn new content that could be applicable for such projects. Something simple like a console-based calculator, anything, just write it yourself with what you've learnt regularly. Be patient too and stick to the path, it's going to be very hard compared to other programming languages and will take significantly longer to get to an intermediate/advanced level at C++.",

They iterate over and over and over again. It is REALLY hard, even for the best designers out there, to achieve a perfectly designed websited from a blank canvas. You build something that kind of works and kind of looks good, and then you improve on that. Then you test, gather feedback, and improve again, ad infinitum.Edit: learning this is quite fun tbh.

If you hadn't already mentioned Node.js I would have suggested looking into other languages/frameworks.But perhaps it would be a good experience to take an \"unexpected turn\" at the cross-roads you are currently on - here's some of my different suggestions for you to perhaps narrow the choice down a bit: Pick one, not more.**1. Continue on the current road**Learn other languages / frameworks for backend development: Java Spring Boot, JavaScript Express, C# w Razor/Blazor, Python w Django / Flask, or whichever combination you find. Something new but well known.**2. Go deeper in the professional development career**Learn more about the infrastructure around coding: all the DevOps branches, testing, automated testing, dev containers, docker, github actions, deployment, CI/CD and so on - become a \"software developer\" more than a programmer, and understand the environment around the software.**3. Go deeper in programming**You have some low level C++ knowledge, but do you understand data structures and algorithms, do you know how a linked list is built, or why a hashmap is as fast as it is? While these aren't necessarily required skills in this day and age, it helps to understand more about the machine, more about why programming works the way it does, and it can be very code-nerdy fun.**4. Take the alternate route**Try something completely new: * perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends* or **games programming** \\- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities* or **hardware programming** \\- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.* or **app development** \\- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.Right now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out. You will always become a better programmer than you already are, no matter which direction you pick!",

        "body": "I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and used to work as a [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) for multiple companies including Amazon. For the list of common professions in the Computer Science world, see: https://roadmap.sh/ I'm going to go through what you wrote one line at a time.> \"So, I'm in my first year of college and honestly, everything in tech seems super interesting—whether it's web development, AI/ML, DevOps, or cybersecurity. The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.\"You start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called \"discrete math\" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): https://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ Also, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489> \"Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.\"You don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.> \"How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?\"Maybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google \"Map of Reddit\", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend . Then there are subreddits for the individual programming languages like r/java , r/LearnJava , r/Python , r/LearnPython , etc.> \"I'd really appreciate some simple advice on where to start and how to explore without feeling overwhelmed.\" Start with the foundations that multiple different professions in the tech industry have in common. For example, backend developers, data science people, data analytics people, data engineers, and software engineering team managers all need to know databases and SQL. Thus, this class, Database Management Systems, should be a class you take at some point: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1JK6_nmwkouMnU3gtD9AF085hR_LhPKIL1bVPzRAS8MA/mobilebasic?pli=1 But yeah, start with establishing a foundation that spans across multiple different professions. Keep your body and mind healthy and sharp, and never stop learning so you can pivot as necessary. Who knows what will be most in demand when you graduate.",

If there are a lot, then you're learning the right language. If there aren't, then it's not entirely useless. Learning any language will teach you some coding principles and practices. This is good, because the ideas are transferrable to other languages. And if you're in school learning computer programming as a concept, you may as well learn them in the language it's being taught in. But bear in mind you'll have to learn the more popular language, like Python, when you've graduated. So let's assume you're learning the wrong language. For instance, maybe the employers in your town all use Python instead. How do you get ahead? My suggestion is to find out what is the most popular language used by the industry in your town, and then start a club on campus where you *teach* it. To be able to teach it, go to [Software-Carpentry.org](http://Software-Carpentry.org) . They have courses that are ready to teach in a variety of popular languages, it's just a matter of learning how to teach the curriculum, and doing the work to practice teaching it. Luckily, they also have self-paced courses that teach you how to teach. And by teaching, you learn. Once you've graduated, saying that you TAUGHT a popular language at a university club will make you stand out.",

Nonetheless you can learn programming basics with it, very well, and use the knowledge for other languages later on. You just need to learn to adapt to a new syntax/library functions.Knowledge of Assembly is good! It will teach you how computers work internally, and what high-level languages work with. Knowing it, you will be able to write more efficient and realistic code. But it is only seldom used nowadays in application programming. It is used in some embedded projects, even when C compilers are way more standard, or platforms running slim interpreters for script languages. It is still useful for some isolated use cases for extreme hand-tuned optimizations, hacking, reverse-engineering etc.The Graphic design you describe as making graphics with basic library functions by a basic or assembly header, I understand. Well, it is toddler stuff fpr beginners imho. You can learn programming with it, and collect experience. But later you will have to move on and learn to use more professional solutions for graphics design.Even if you study these topics in university, I'd recommend you to privately stay busy with more widespread, professional components, i.e. python, java(-script)/typescript, C/C++, ... Another benefit of these languages is, aside possible involvement in way more professional production projects, that you can massively learn from the open source scene using these languages, i.e. on GitHub, and you can get all the tools and docs you need for free from the internet!",

The ai creates code based off what I prompt it for, so I'm telling it what I want to make, it generates code to do it, I type it out but I hit enter to use intellisence completion rather than AI prediction completion, so it is kind of teaching me how to write the code quicker if I wasn't using AI.Then I always have to make sure I know what the generated code is doing so I know how the functions work and what they're doing exactly.

If you only have a mechanistic understanding, then you have to spend time learning every single time you are presented with something new, instead of applying existing knowledge.

Over time, the small tools and projects are what filled the knowledge gaps and really solidified concepts and patterns. You just have to get your hands virtually dirty. The grocery item tracking app is a great start. Or tic tac toe, the game of life, or even a small app to read and parse data from a web API. You’ll learn it doesn’t matter what language you start with, the concepts and ideas of “programming” transcends the language itself.

Most importantly, don't burn yourself out trying to keep the ship afloat while self-learning, otherwise everything goes to shit once your health is gone and it'll be gone before you know it and be very hard to recover from.",

As a matter of fact, I ended up leading a team as Tech Lead of 9 people.What helped me was always trying to learn more. Fing blogs like Daily Brew ..... read up on different technologies. Work to learn best practices and make sure you aren't complacent about things like continuous deployment, source control, and design practices. When you read comments about lone developers that ended up with problems, they always mentioned that they had their way of doing things, and usually they were not documented, no source control, etc.Working with other devs, I was surprised by how similar the issues a Python dev or a UI guy has run into.

If you can't handle that delay after having typed in a command, of course you should go with the faster version ...Anyways, never believe anyone talking about how some constructs in the programming language are faster or slower than others - usually they are wrong, and perpetuate myths started by 1970s assembly-programmers. And a note to those, who think that a string comparison takes additional time - it doesn't. In all modern languages, strings are immutable and handled by the runtime, which means that comparing one string to another is as simple as comparing two addresses - it is as fast as comparing any other value!",

The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).It's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. If you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.If you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. interface Command { void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs); }Replace `SomeType` with the actual type.You would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say). You'd do something like // commandMap is a hash map Command obj = commandMap.get(commandName); obj.runCommand(commandName, lineArgs);It is a bit more complicated to get this set up, but not a whole lot more.",

That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of \"should I consider this now\" vs \"note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue\".I am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.B: You have decided to listen to random people give you \"this is how it is\" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident \"this is how it is\" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.Anyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.edit: I dropped the term \"function pointer\" in this without thinking language. Deep in my C work right now. Dispatch table/pattern is still a great idea, but ignore my usage of the term function pointer.",

It looks 3d, but it uses clever tricks and is really not.This repository has code for one [https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game) .That said, this is an order of magnitude more complex so google Doom in Python and do a good amount of reading. If you make it through both of those projects you will be ready to start looking at real 3d games. Keep in mind while you can do 3D in Python, it will be slow. 3D games use some form of C. or a related compiled language. Full on game development environments like Unreal Engine have optimized libraries and allow you to create at a very high level and then build the game executable. Game development is a long road. Good luck!",

If it's more complex than ascii characters in the terminal, you likely need a game engine, that handles texture loading, 3d rendering, physics implementation, etc...Every game is basically the initialization stage, load initial textures etc... and then the game loop, which will call a set of functions inter-frame or every frame.If you're interested in making your own game engine instead of a game, be ready for a lot of mathematics (basic stuff really, like vectors, linear algebra, and euclidean geometry, which to be honest are pretty inter-connected).If you're just interested about making a game, just choose a game engine, or one of those game-ready libraries out there, and learn about them.",

It's a testament to the language that it is still mostly backwards compatible with the versions 1.2 or 1.3 that you must have worked on. Of course, there was no Spring framework, or even a decent Java IDE back then. I do think Spring (doesn't have to be Boot) is a great choice for a complex Java app. JetBrains IntelliJ is the best IDE, with VSCode as a close second. Git should be your version control system. Start with JUnit for your tests.Bootcamp is an attractive idea. You would get a great immersive introduction, but it will cost, on average, about USD 13000. I am a bit of a cheapskate, so I would just learn it on my own.You don't really need a webserver if you are building a REST API. Your UI apps will just invoke the API, the same way that you would do it programmatically. If your app needs to scale massively, then AWS, or any other quality cloud service provider, is your answer. Much easier to set up a proof of concept when you can get a wealth of services, but only have to pay for what you use. AWS will host your database as well. A lot of people don't seem to realize it, but you can easily write a performant Spring Java REST API / Db access app as an AWS Lambda. Although if you need a monolith, then EC2 hosting scalable containers like Fargate will do the job as well.",

A heap is a data structure, but the process of turning something into a heap, or putting data into or taking it out of a heap, is an algorithm.When you need to solve a problem, you will build an algorithm using data structures that match the way you need to move or store data.Just follow along with your classes, and they'll teach you this stuff.If you want to do a little extra, try doing leetcode or hackerrank exercises, these are basically just problems that use a particular algorithm/data structures, but they're changed a little from how you'll learn them in classes so that you have to think hard about how to solve them.",

I think learning algorithms along side data structures is important as data structures are used within algorithms to model whatever it is you’re trying to do. I’d take a moment and get a stretch goal laid out of a project that incorporates these tools step at a time. Example: create a list with an “exit” or key search term. Then optimize your solution for a bigger data set. Lastly use a popular search algorithm (binary search for example) to implement for your solution. Did it decrease your run time? Can you do it in less lines of code? Optimization is one of the key tasks all scientists have to learn as they’re testing in the field. Don’t treat computer programming any different.

It costs money (you can try it for free), but it isn't a lot and the content is high enough quality that I feel it is worth every penny. In addition, since your specifically interested in web development, I'd recommend the Odin project. It has a lot of front end stuff, and it is really well made I think (also free). The two of those combined should really set you up for both backend and frontend development. Some other great resources are freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and edX. Coursera and edX have some free courses, I think Harvard's CS50 is often the go to recommend for a first course in coding on here. freeCodeCamp is just awesome in my opinion. They produce so much content on so much, everything from LLMs to web development to making video games.",

First thing you'll do is get acquainted with learning techniques that can be applied to any subject. Then you'll learn the most necessary parts of basic web development using HTML, CSS, JS. Then, backend systems, and then, you'll learn about frontend JS frameworks. Finally, you'll build a real project, an application that you would use. That's just the practical stuff, though. There are plenty of lessons that go into CS concepts like OOP, Data Structure & Algorithms, etc. On top of that, you'll learn how to build a network. Going into 3 more years of college with that skill and you will definitely have a job before you graduate. Oh, and your classmates who are getting paid for their side projects? Well, part of the program is to get your own client, make a little money, and beef up your resume.I started 100devs December 2021 with basically no coding knowledge and had a job by September 2022 with no CS degree; I'm employed today and the skills I learned there have kept me well above that pack of other folks with the same YOE and degrees. It is more of a Job program than a bootcamp, but the way the coding is taught is really easily digestible. Technically, the program is like 7-9 months, but I finished(including the big project) in about 5, and that was with a job and other adult responsibilities; I imagine a summer would be enough time to get through it if you don't have much else going on. I tried to stick to the two classes a week schedule like when they did it live, but it didn't take long before I was watching at 2x and skipping big portions of the videos, so accelerating is definitely possible.Lots of people say \"Build stuff\", \"Do projects\", etc.; I think that's definitely something you should do, but it isn't super helpful for someone in your position. You'll build lots of things with the technologies that you're learning doing 100devs.Best of luck!",

Then add in dimensionality. Lastly, try to add classes to encapsulate the shape dimensionality and behavior.

This stuff might seem dumb or simple, but it’s practicing the simple stuff that experienced developers often forget isn’t automatic for new devs.You said you didn’t do well in your classes.

Or if you studied a foreign language, ask yourself how long it took. Was it just magic that you learned it? Probably not.Learning to program is somewhat similar. You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.There's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.We all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.For a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read. As you do this, you can do the equivalent in C# which is reasonably similar to Java.",

You can learn to code while making games and it's a fun way to keep things interesting. However, it's very unreasonable to be writing your own game engine, especially as a complete novice.If you just care about making the game, getting it finished and shipping it, you will save yourself, probably years of effort to do so in an already established engine. Godot, unity or unreal are all good options. Look into which is best for you.As a beginner programmer, I guarantee you will not create anything more complicated than a pacman style game for a significant amount of time if not using an engine. This is fine if you're trying to learn about the programming language. Using classes, inheritance, polymorphism learning about common patterns etc. but this likely will not produce what you expect. Even veteran programmers, solo, struggle to make entire games. We haven't even got into art, animation or sound yet.Finally, why C#? Why not Java, or C or C++ or python? If you can't answer this question then go back to the drawing board and decide based on facts.\"Python because it's very forgiving and beginner friendly with great libraries like pygame\"\"C++ to get me closer to the hardware allowing me more control over how my game is run\"\"Java because I hate existence and want the most disgusting challenge ever\"All are acceptable answers.

My concern would be that you're struggling to get through the content, even when taking ADHD meds. If you don't have a genuine interest in programming (as in, actually programming, not \"what you think programming is\"), then it isn't unlikely that it's just... \"not your thing\". You don't need to be a math genius, or be able to perfectly follow code in your mind, but you do need to be interested. A lot of the developers I know could take ADHD meds and program for 18 hours straight. It make them insatiable.At some point, you'll need to learn more about data structures, algorithms, and memory (which is usually what the Bootcamps skip). I tried my hardest not to learn that stuff for as long as possible, but eventually... you just need to. It helps you recognize problems and how to solve them.JavaScript is particularly tricky (even though it's also beginner-friendly) because it's the only language that has built-in templating, windowing, rendering, and styling (HTML, the browser, and CSS). Vanilla JS teaches you about manually manipulating The DOM, but the second you move into more professionally-oriented work, you'll likely be using frameworks like React that abstract The DOM away. So they teach you all this \"document.querySelector\" stuff in JS, it's unlike anything in any other language, and when you've finally figured it out, they say \"just kidding, we usually use libraries to do that for us\".JS and all of it's libraries, packages, and frameworks update regularly. Syntax changes, frameworks fade in and out of popularity, and you'll need to keep up. I'm autistic with ADHD, and for me that's a benefit. It keeps changing, but it keeps getting better, the tools are fun and relatively easy to use, and I enjoy trying and learning all of the new stuff. Keeps me from getting bored and keeps me sharp.Bootcamps are intended to jump-start you. So they'll walk you through database, server, and user interface - relatively quickly - so you have a reasonable understanding of how to build a complete application, even if you don't perfectly understand the languages, syntax, and tools being used. It's just a starting point.For Vanilla JS, as is always recommended in this subreddit, [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/) is the best, most modern, comprehensive, interactive tutorial. If you can get through part 1 (save part 2 and part 3 for later), you'll have a really good understanding of Vanilla JS, it's tools and it's syntax (depending on how well you learn, and how well you integrate what you learn).",

I need to have a way to hold all the first letters (declare a variable that contains a list) 2. I need to go through the list of fruit (list is an array in JavaScript) 3, for each fruit in the list, i need to get the first letter (for loop because I need to repeatedly do the same action to each fruit in the list) 4.

Keep going.Every time you think you get it, challenge your understanding, try to break it. Try to prove to yourself that you don't get it. That will lead you to the next cycle quicker.There's no final moment when you \"get it all\". It's literally too much to fit into one brain.But there is a moment when you \"get\" that this constant learning, invalidating and then rebuilding your understanding is the goal you've been chasing all along.You won't ever learn it all, but step by step, you will learn enough to build cool things.Then, you'll look back at the world of programming, and you will still have no clue how 99.9% of it works. But you will have the feeling that if you had 10 years of spare time, you could have built any random 0.0001% sized chunk of it yourself.I think that's the point where people say they \"get it\".Also, lot of programming is a mess for all kinds of human, logic, or historical reasons. People try to make the languages and libraries neat and organized, but it's a bit like the drawer in everyone's house where they store half-empty AA batteries right next to rubber bands, bag of spare IKEA screws and coffee filters.

In any job, you are going to have good points and bad points. And as real professionals, though, we must find \"stomach\" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.There are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others. For example, Web Development, Frontends, etc. Some people really enjoy doing that kind of work, and others find it kind of dreadful or annoying. You have to learn what kind of programming or systems \"get you up in the morning\" as it were.But if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get \"to the goal\" and that is always a good feeling for me. For example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually \"get it good enough\" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. In any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology).

So you don't need to search for it. But you still need to traverse the *k*-1 preceding items to reach your target. That's the access runtime.And so on like that, for all the data structures that have access times listed on that website. But a hash table has no stable order. So there can be no cogent concept of \"accessing the *k*th element\". You have to search every time. (At least that's the argument for the N/A, I think!)",

To stick with your example, attempting to create your own Carousel module might seem tedious, but it might be great practice nonetheless.

Some people just throw money at me so I do think the price could go up. I assume you're referring to the watering timers or the smart home features or do you think I'm underselling baseline storage,add,VPN combo? For smart home features I'm curious what you'd charge, 200$ profit for motion and voice lights, 17-20 for materials, 60 for the extra functionality, you're already paying the 300 in this option so total price comes out to 570 now. They buy their own lights so customer cost goes into the 650s-700s. So it does get a bit crazy on the customers end.. since I've never seen this service offered and definitely not peer to peer I don't have any baseline though. Garage door opener is another big seller if they bought the lights I'll bundle in the door for 50 profit on my side, they see around 70$ additional charge. If they didn't starting is still 200. Temperature controls if above it bought I'll bundle it for 100 additional profit, this I know I should increase since people always have weird requests when it comes to temperature. Always gotta modify this one. The watering feature is definitely under priced but people treat it as a novelty and walk away from the additional 160 even though that's only 100$ profit on my end. When I do get a sale it's just a script flip and hand off the hardware with instructions, for a very hard sell in minimal time I almost want to remove the option but something is better than nothing I guess. If I move to a higher income area this may be the biggest seller but for my city...",

        "body": "If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)MinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)WSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.Otherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.On Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.For desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good. If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.Most Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.For editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.So that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.I’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.IIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.On Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.If you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)I recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)If you learn C, K\\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.Good luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",

It often tries to move me onto other ways of doing things but for my own projects I focus on my understanding first. You can tell in one glance projects that were built “with”/by AI. For my final project I had like 15 or 16 jFrames involved, the code was drastically different through each section as my skills were improving. For my review I was able to explain multiple concepts and give reasons why I chose this approach and which one I would use in what scenario going forward. AI should be a tool not the conductor. Just start trying to code things yourself and when you hit an issue or bug work around it to improve your skills rather than throwing them out the window.",

        "body": "Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.After that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. We lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. Now that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.I know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",

If you’re one of those people then I suggest taking a couple Google courses and get yourself a google certification. They look amazing on resumes.Create yourself a LinkedIn page and start networking! There is literally nothing more important than networking in this market. Goto hackathons, tech events in your area, post on linkedin and talk with recruiters etc… Have all your code public on github.And if you’re serious about perusing a job in this market as a junior make sure you can code without AI and code with AI (not vibe coding but using it as a tool to speed up your development)",

        "body": "From the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/ranges-indexes):>A range specifies the start and end of a range. The start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive, meaning the start is included in the range but the end isn't included in the range. The range \\[0..\\^0\\] represents the entire range, just as \\[0..sequence.Length\\] represents the entire range.[A comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54092520) on stack overflow contains some sorta lost info on how this came to be:>We decided to follow Python when it comes to the from-beginning and from-end arithmetic. 0 designates the first element (as always), and \\^0 the “length’th” element, i.e. the one right off the end. That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \\^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span. But you can also have methods that take ranges, for instance.",

Once you learned TypeScript, you also get used to have a lot of guardrails, and there's no reason to go back to coding without those guardrails as you'll encounter issues at runtime (in the browser console) that will require you to debug more lines of code. It's not a shortcoming for JS, because for a senior JS developer it's part of the job to keep a tight ship, code linearity and easily readable unit tests (see examples of Express in JS), but for someone learning: choose TypeScript as long as it is an option (almost always is nowadays).I even believe that frontend needs TS more than backend, because it's harder to structure frontend for code linearity when you have more important hierarchies such as layouts, components, events, async effects, the DOM... The logic is being called from potentially many different places and it's harder to enforce type consistency everywhere \"by hand\".",

Roughly coming up to 5 years of experience. I went from retail sales to tech (I work for a financial institution, American company but in London). Salary is great, lifestyle is balanced, and you learn a lot. But boy oh boy, you have to dumb a lot of the stuff you learn. It's incredibly hard not having a CS degree to stay focused, a lot of the basics DSA you won't have heard of just because you followed a Udemy course etc. You really have to learn a lot of it, I'm 5 years in and still learn fundamental stuff once in a while. Thankfully with DevOps, it's less coding atm so I can spend some time coding on the side outside work. I do mostly terraform with AWS atm, and use other tools like Docker, K8s, etc. You learn a lot on the job, and I mean A LOT. Thankfully, I have a very very good team who is about developing engineers. I won't be a CTO in my lifetime but idc, I'm an engineer and I want to solve stuff. I would say do not do a bootcamp, you learn web dev mostly, you skip out on important stuff like BigO, DSA etc. plus, don't enjoy web Dev as much anywaysDo self taught mostly, I used to research what modules get taught at university for CS degrees, and focus on those modules for a while. Definitely helped more (I took a bootcamp from Makers in the UK)",

Two weeks ago I got two offers and and accepted one as a Software Engineer without any professional experience. Here's the route I took:2 year technical college. This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.After graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).When you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.The market sucks, but some things don't change. The jobs are still out there, and the people that put in the extra work still stand out. Don't be in a rush, make sure the jobs you interview for are a good fit for you. Hopefully something in here helps you on your journey. Good luck!",

If you do I would suggest looking up games that are similar to your idea first and take note of which game engines such games use. After that you can compare these game engines by how easy they are to use, how hard is the language they require to know, is the price for your budget etc. Then you can learn the basics of the language of your engine on platforms like Coursera, Udemy etc. You most likely won't be ready to make your game immediately after that, so watching tutorials/ courses on how to develop games (especially the kind of game you want to make) with your specific engine can be the next step.This would be a time-efficient approach if you already have an idea. And once you learn a language, learning a new one is quite easy so if you want you can move onto a new engine in the future without too much struggle, as well. Good luck",

The first thing you will need to do is actually learn javascript. Then you can use something like Phaser or Kaboom.js or just plain old javascript.This girl does a lot with JS and Kaboom.js for games[https://www.youtube.com/@aniakubow](https://www.youtube.com/@aniakubow)This guy has a good series for building with just regular JS (he has a paid courses but the only thing you get is better assets so it \"looks better\" but there is no extra logical coding so take for that what you will)[https://www.youtube.com/c/chriscourses](https://www.youtube.com/c/chriscourses)I don't really have any resources for Phaser but you can easily google that and find one.FreeCodeCamp probably has all fo these in their long video series as well.The key part is gonna be, learn the syntax, follow a game course then STOP FOLLOWING COURESES. Start building your own games, the first couple actually the first probably 5-10 are gonna suck and you are gonna suck at it, and we all did that's not specific to you, it's just how you learn stuffThis is less related to your question about gaming but still relevant to you learning so read this post since I was sick of typing it 50 times a week (not a dig on you just these questions get asked a lot and reddit does suck for searching in my opinion) [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9lo95/comment/mhe6xfw/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9lo95/comment/mhe6xfw/?context=3)",

I’m sorry OP..I will echo one of the responders you might be better off seeking some vocational training at a community college over trying to mess with bootcamps…there’s less stigma during hiring with AS Degrees.Just know without a full blown CS degree the going will be tough and we are currently in the most junior unfriendly hiring market I have ever seen in my 11 years of working in this field. Literally no one is looking for junior devs right now and it’s sad…because there is in fact a shortage of GOOD senior level and mid level devs and engineers BUT in order to get fresh talent we have to train the new incoming juniors…no one wants to do that right now though.",

In the real world if your employer has you switch languages best case scenario you’ll have a month’s time to pick the new language up.",

        "body": "I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's responseI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.In contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:Physical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.There are several approaches to partitioning memory:1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.For allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:- Which blocks are allocated or free- The size of each block- The process using each allocated blockWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available blockThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.Modern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues.",

Assuming you're in Windows, you can look up some DOS commands to navigate the terminal (Windows calls it PowerShell, you can open it by opening the start menu and typing \"cmd\").Programming for the terminal at least to start is way simpler than jumping into GUIs. You can learn that later, but you'll need solid basic understanding of coding first. Libraries exist so that you don't need to rewrite code that already exists. If you're changing the oil in your car, you don't want to make an oil filter by hand, they are an off the rack standard component. Same with coding, things that are used all the time can be made into libraries so you can just get them off the rack and use them, rather than making them by hand. To know if a library exists for what you're looking for, do a search online or ask people experienced with Python or whatever language you're learning (after doing your own search).",

        "body": "If you want to know \"how Docker works\", that can really be broken down into two separate questions:1. What Linux kernel features do you use, and how do you use them, to get the behaviors that we call \"containerization\"?2. How is the Docker software organized and architected to use those features?I think question 1 is the more relevant one for what you're asking. [Part 8 of this presentation](https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html) (the \"Deep dive into container internals\" section) is the best self-contained overview that I know of. For more details, a good starting point would be to read all of the Linux kernel documentation and manpages about cgroups, namespaces, chroot, etc.The short version is: the Unix permission system has always provided some basic ability to \"isolate\" processes from each other, e.g. a process belonging to UID can't kill another process with a different UID. This is just enforced by the kernel doing permission checks on the appropriate syscalls. A more interesting example is the `chroot` syscall, which tells the kernel to change the \"apparent\" root directory for a process, so that it can't see or modify any files outside that root. Containerization is just \"chroot on steroids\" by telling the kernel to isolate process groups in various ways.Beyond that, the \"sharing\" of the kernel works in pretty much the same way that it does without containerization. When a process asks for memory, or the scheduler decides which process to run in a given time slice, the kernel makes the same kind of decision it always does -- except that it keeps track of some extra accounting information to enforce fairness and resource limits between \"containers\".Question 2 is a bit less technically interesting, but still somewhat important because it's useful to know where to look for the relevant source code if you really want to dig into the implementation. For instance, when you run a \"Docker container\", Docker is delegating the work to containerd, and containerd is invoking runc to actually start the container. So runc is where the actual relevant syscalls are made. You can see an overview of *what* runc is doing [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/libcontainer/SPEC.md), and you can find more details of how it interacts with the rest of the system by reading the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.2.1/spec.md).",

Just be polite and have a tone like a request for help rather than an accusation and you should be ok. Stuff that can be jarring for native English speakers vs Indian English - - pauses at weird points mid sentence and sometimes multiple times per sentence- rising tones like asking a question but during a statement or other part of a sentence- dropped words (your brain will autocomplete the sentence anyway once you get used to whoever you’re working with) - certain phrases (do the needful being one of the most infamous) and words (definitely, certainly, surely, etc pop up frequently) that you will soon realize are far more vague than they imply. For example the “definitely” does not mean definitely, it can often be said as a “yeah yeah whatever” vibe- sometimes questions are phrased more like demands, but just know that usually it’s still a request and no offense is intended.

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.Tech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the \"not-so-passionate\" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.Could there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec \"overheard\" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.So yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real. But if you're banking on market-wide comp dropping because of wishful exec thinking, you're betting on unicorns *and* leprechauns.",

If this is true, this is a big reason why people say job hop young because companies wont give you the big pay raise but will pay a newcomer all they want. You have all the power in negotation and the market will dictate how much you make. So there is probably some give or take as to why newer people are making more off the bat.

Where, when, and how they work is not necessarily up to you. If you dictate they next come to your office, at x time, to do y work, they are likely going to be classified as an employee.In this case, it sounds like OP is an employee for a company, and his employer has a contract to do work. An employee has to do what the employer requires, or the employer is free to fire them. Writing that a job is remote can trigger some legal protections for how much notice they must give you to change your work location, but any employer can change your work location as long as the proper notice period is given. That depends on the state, but it's usually pretty short anyway.",

Hardly anyone will tell you this, because it's likely you don't have anyone close enough in your life that you wouldn't immediately push away, if they pressed you to pursue getting help. That is a sign of the problem, in addition to spending several years and not actually getting software dev experience, which speaks to fundamental motivation. (It is worth asking the question: you've done some of it, do you enjoy doing it at all?)Get signed up for whatever affordable coverage you can and go find a therapist that has a background in depression, addiction, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.If you really don't know where to start, go to a Gambling Addictions Anonymous meeting. You don't have to buy into it all the way. It will give you a place to say your piece, as well as talk to people who have gone through similar things, de-stigmatizing the shame.People are saying quit trading and gambling. You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. You need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).This stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am. Stop reading this, and go do that immediately. Can't do it right now? Write it on a note and put it on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Somewhere you can't ignore. Just do what it takes to deal with this. If you actually do nothing about it, nobody will care about your suffering. Why do I say this? Because everything I have seen you write indicates an immaturity in dealing with the consequences of your own actions. You need to own that first, and you need to help yourself. Because you have created problems that will take years to solve, and you have to be the one to do it. The upside is you will feel better when you actually start doing working on it. Congratulations on making it this far, and good luck.",

Here’s why:The curriculum for most technical certifications are guided training paths curated by actual experts in those technologies. Going through that gauntlet successfully gives you the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in those domains. The actual paper cert is a nice resume bonus. Take an academic approach to learning Spring, Java etc and you’ll get a boost of confidence to successfully apply those technologies. Fail at them, and maybe this thing isn’t for you",

Now they all seem to have said, if you dont hire we wont, and have changed the overall strategy they are approaching innovation and development, this to me is the biggest threat of LLMs and AI.

It wasn’t this way years ago (on average) and hiring was kinder and new grads got time and breathing space. Companies have gone into a hyper optimization mode where investing in people is now bad because loyalty is not valued. Why invest if you can throw people out at a whim?Edit: Yes I’ve worked at FAANGs too and have been in this industry a long time.",

Admitting that would require self-reflection and adaptation.In fact my hot take is, if your juniors are your bottleneck that makes you bleed anywhere near the most amount of money then your company doesn't deserve to exist.Tough luck.

As opposed to giving them answers, or even lecturing / dumping similar solutions on them.If the change is as easy as you say, it should be super easy to sit with this dev for an hour and arrive at the solution together. Let them flounder a little and explain their thought process to you, if they get stuck, ask leading questions that nudges them in the right direction. Try to teach them *your process*, as opposed to the answer. The key is you want *them* to solve it, not you. You just want to be their safety net that helps them reach that point.A simple \"Hey, how's X going? Wanna pair up today and see if I can be any help?\" goes a long way.Sometimes the answer to \"how's it going\" might be \"Oh I already fixed it I think, I was just working on figuring out how to test / add unit tests / open a PR / etc\". Really this is stuff that should be coming out in standup so you can reach out before it's been a full 4 days when you notice they're not making any progress... but it sounds like yall either aren't doing standup or this dev isn't providing accurate updates.As others have said this stuff was easier in the office. For whatever reason there's a tougher barrier to break to send someone a DM, as opposed to just casually walking past their cubicle and asking \"How's it going?\".",

The first problems I generally give to people when they join a project is ones that we have groomed and laid out the solution for them, and I expect them to learn more by getting into the codebase and testing the effects before and after. It takes awhile for someone to actually be able to find and solve problems when they are just getting into a code base.",

If the answer is a simple one line change then it raises the question why you haven't just submitted a quick PR to fix it yourself. If I put my management hat on I would be concerned that you are attempting to make your mistake someone else's problem and avoid fixing it. If the answer is that they are to use this as an opportunity to learn the code base and understand the flow then 4 days is certainly reasonable for self learning. If your concern is that he's not up to speed fast enough then you might need to reset your expectations for a new member of the team and self evaluate how you can help ease his transition. Traditionally these are the kinds of things a quick desk side collaborations that happens informally in the office as they are getting up to speed. When working remote you tend to be a bit more siloed so you need to be much more deliberate with your teamwork and collaboration efforts. If your expectation is to just pass tickets off and forget about it you aren't going to have a very effective team. My suggestion would be to set up a 30 minuet working session and go over the fix, but also why the fix works.",

Since a bug means it's at a specific issue, stemming from a specific place, because of a specific reason, all of which you have the benefit of knowing the specific context having created it. All of which benefits if they are actually learning the codebase if that was the purpose then it's alright in my view.If you just want them to come to the solution having given them a hint, then this is a matter of trust. The solution you gave with \"similar\" bugs implies it's not exactly the same then which might throw someone off and dismiss it.

From first hand experience, NVIDIA has excellent culture and a strong hiring pipeline for interns, and we're doing lots of cool work in ML depending on team. Meta is probably also a good one if you want to be doing cutting edge ML work. I don't think you can go wrong with either NVIDIA or Meta.Edit: for more context, a SWE at NVIDIA working on ML is more likely to be inside the guts of a model, figuring out how to optimize its throughput or latency. A MLE at Meta is more likely to be applying ML to solve a business problem. So it depends on which part of the problem you want to work on.",

I think I mostly told people that I was taking some time for myself to focus on hobbies to wait for the job market to improve a little. The truth was that I was still applying to jobs pretty consistently and getting rejected or ghosted, but to be fair, some of those were definitely due to companies having layoffs and no longer hiring for the position. Also, the personal hobby I was the most focused on was building my wedding photography business, which I didn't share with recruiters bc I didn't want them thinking it might get in the way of being a dedicated full-time employee.Edited to add: I'd also sometimes talk about how I wasn't in a huge rush to get back into the job market and was just keeping an eye out for the Right Opportunity.",

However, many companies outright imploded then. There were a lot of companies making no money, with financially non-viable businesses, whose stock value was based entirely on hype. Companies like Tesla today that are very hype driven still bring in billions of dollars of revenue each year. A lot of people genuinely believed the internet was a failed fad, that software was, at best, a boring thing banks used that had no growth potential.Since then, the industry has grown in size tremendously. In absolute numbers, more people are impacted by layoffs today. But businesses are not folding left and right like back then. The job market is slow. There have been many layoffs, but there are still millions employed in the industry. Pay is still higher relative to other jobs than it was back then. There's certainly no sense that the internet was a fad, or tech is going away entirely.",

In my first job i worked in defense industry. It was great. The codebase wasnt easy but it was a pretty chill job and i got paid somewhat well (80k starting off) and for working 20 hours was a top performer. I decided to try out faang and the last 3 years was very stressful. I just couldnt understand the codebase and how things connected. J wasnt a great communicator either and struggled to find the right resources for help. The job was very demanding. I got fired this year due to low perforamance. I made sure to get a new job that would be more in line with having good work life balance ans not be so demanding. Even if it meant i had to take less. Im currently working for a new job and it seems it wont be too demanding so far. The first thing they told me was “if you want to be the guy who works 40 hours and gets your task done. You can have a long career here. If you want to prioritize getting promoted quickly and working a bit extra. We just advise you respect your work life balance.”Edit: just to add. I think if you found something that was more chill, even if the pay was a but less or the benefits werent the best, you should do it.",

They gave me guest version control account, a restricted repository, branch and requested an MR for the loosely described task. Nothing was off the limit. I used documentations, internet and AI to complete the task. After that submission got cleared and a follow up was arranged I had near 2 hours with 2 engineers going over all details of my submission. Ran the project locally and they asked me key performance and functionality questions. We discussed the shortcomings of my submission and what I could have done better… totally open conversation with many back and forth exchanges. Impossible to fake if you haven’t done the work or used AI without understanding. This is where they actually verify it all. Having done these interviews I always left with the confidence that these guys know what they’re doing, and that I was respected as an adult. Not surprisingly, working with them has been a similar experience. I spend more time finding these companies than actual interviews. It’s not easy to come across such companies which also have great compensation and interesting projects so I have very specific set of questions to narrow down at the initial interview. LC… or any kind of trivia crap and I bail. This is also why I never interview when I need a job. I interview when I’m okay so I won’t have to rush or take these subpar interviews.",

It takes a lot of effort. Anyone can do it but the vast majority of people don’t like it enough to study it constantly for years until they get paid to do it. If you drop everything, quit your job, and study, you should be prepared to invest a lot of time.The market isn’t the best right now. Not as bad as some say but it’s definitely not great. Out of my graduating cohort of like 50 students, I think maybe 10 percent are working as software engineers.

With the caveat that you will be a cog because scale includes the scale of the number of their employees. Doors will permanently be opened to you because you did this, but I learned a lot from G as well once I realized that was something I had to do. G or M > A, partly because A is structured as a VC fund in a trench coat and is much lower prestige, and partly because even in 2025, G and M have wildly better WLB. I'm not hearing about regular deaths yet and I lost two teammates at A. Did you know that G vests all your stocks when you die and at least at the time, A did not?And they pay well enough that you can afford the Bay even with a family unless they're bringing you on as a new grad. (Which they might. They might not even be wrong. Working on that type of organization is a skill.)Personally, I'd say 20 months or 20 years. 20 Months is long enough to stare at their size, scale, and institutional structure (Another reason not to A; It's just a bunch of startups) and pick up a bunch of lessons without forgetting how to use more standard tooling. Plus a 4-6 month job search and boom two years at the big G. Or you love it and they love you and you don't get laid off until you retire.",

These decisions are often based on what team you're on, your role, tenure.

There are exceptions, but knowing your stuff will often get you to a sensible result faster in the scope of the interview. You need to be able to coherently explain and reason about your code, why you're taking one approach instead of another. Using AI in an interview doesn't pair well with this. It also gives me less signal as an interviewer.All this to say, when you're ready to start your job search, you should be doubling down on fundamentals, Leetcode and upskilling on things like React/whatever framework you're rusty with. Using AI on the job is one thing, but imo you should be focused on fundamentals and interview prep in the short term.Once you have a job, then worry about how you'll use AI to work faster and better.",

On that note, I would right this second reach out to those other companies and ask them if they still have an opening because your current company has reneged on the remote status of your role. Worth a shot - because if they say \"yeah, would love to have you, here's an offer\", you can tell you current job to kick rocks.And if you end up leaving on any capacity, I think it's 100% fair to write an email to both the upper manager and HR emphasizing how incredibly unprofessional it is to change the terms of employment, fill out reviews on Glassdoor - and honestly, name and shame them here.",

They're the responsibility of management.We're IC's, we're responsible for doing the best work we can during our 40 hour work week. It doesn't matter if we get assigned 20 peoples-worth of responsibility. All that means is we will work to prioritize, and accurately communicate progress and ***timelines*** (independent of \"deadlines\") spread across 1 persons-worth of work weeks. That's how the exchange of labor works. Don't scale your hours.Management has tools in their toolbelt to account for at-risk deadlines. It's literally project management 101, shit interns learn, shit that's like on page 1 of any sort of guide to PM. They can dial back scope, they can hire more resources, or they can push back the deadline.Forcing their resources to work more than 40 hours isn't a (healthy) option. But if the SWE's *let them*, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of it. So don't let them. Work your 40 hours. Communicate everything based on those 40 hours. \"We need it done by X\" doesn't matter, because based on your 40 hour work week your job is to communicate the *realistic* estimate. \"Ok... well if I drop A, B, C, D, E, and F, I can get G done by X\", or \"If we take an MVP approach and get rid of H, I, J, and K requirements we can get the MVP done by X\".Everything you're describing is a failure of management, not of you. Deadlines, staffing, prioritization, scope, etc. It's all in *their* job description. Will your management like you establishing and sticking to your professional boundaries?Probably not. But you know what their options are? Fire you, and set their timeline back by *bare minimum* another 6-12 months across the board (probably more). Does that sound like a smart option? Call their bluff.Put in your 40, be realistic, be communicative, don't fall victim to \"deadlines\", and if your management ignores your very reasonable professional boundaries, start looking for another job. The market being bad doesn't change any of this.",

Instead of stressing about interviews that don't happen, pour more energy into getting better at LeetCode and practicing behavioral questions with a friend or family member. It'll make you feel more prepared when (not if) you do land an interview.One thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to the interview and suggests responses in real time.

Everything went so much smoother having the same device as my team members, *especially* onboarding.I've done that at every job since. If I'm given the choice, I ask what most of the team is using, and go with that.At the end of the day, the OS you use isn't *that* big of a deal. It's not hard to switch. It's just a computer.

Try compile and get errors the linker is missing - If I need it why not just install it etc. It’s been the same with a few other things. Windows is just easier to me. I suspect if I invested time into using my Mac for development and got used to the Mac way of doing things it would be ok. But I’m too invested In windows now. Also I find the Mac versions of some software is behind or not as good. I do a lot of c# development.

        "body": "This depends on a few things \\* The kind of job search you're doing (fishing around for new offers with low information vs already knowing exactly what you want)\\* The quality of the recruiter\\* The job market that you're inMost of the time I would say no; in general I think it's best to have an idea of where you want to be and give that range for where you want to be. Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).However third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.If you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).Hope that provides some clarity.EDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time. Knowing approximately where you stand saves everyone time and makes you better positioned in the hunt.",

How you work through this is way beyond reddit.I have never focused on prestige, I care about a lot of other things more than I do prestige.

I don't struggle when I look for new jobs, not even when I job hopped in 2024 when everyone was screaming that the world is over.

I think you just brushed this off, but it sounds like you feel the need to constantly validate and confirm your worth due to insecurity. Hopefully it should go away once you get some experience under your belt, or if your priority in life changes(such as getting a partner, getting married, starting a family, etc.).Not every successful engineer becomes an icon in the tech world, a social media influencer, or even a revered name that is whispered among their peers. While some become celebrities in their own domains, others prefer a life of quiet anonymity. > But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, career advancement almost entirely depends on perception. Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.This is because you surround yourself with people who believe in this and actively participate in this grind. Will this culture always exist? Sure, but you don't have to feel like it's the only way and that you're a prisoner to that way of life.",

        "body": "You’re right that perception is important. “Your career is what people think of you” is a pretty insightful way to think about progression. But I think you’re thinking about it too simply, and the way you’re approaching it is (at least slightly) counterproductive. It is valuable to be perceived as competent, confident, and personable. When switching jobs, making new connections, or seeking capital investment, peoples default assumption will be that the MIT grad who’s a staff engineer at FAANG is smarter/more capable than the state school grad working in QA at northwest mutual. But I think at some point, you cross a vague threshold where you’re taken seriously at a glance and you don’t really need to worry about micromanaging “prestige”. I’d even say that continuing to be visibly/noticeably concerned with prestige is a negative signal if you’ve already “made it” into high scale software development. It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. Strongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning. I don’t mean this in a flippant way, but agonizing about picking meta or google or citadel for prestige reasons is probably a question for therapy. It sounds like you’ve overcome a lot of challenges to get where you are. I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. But things aren’t as Machiavellian as you’re thinking. People aren’t going to go out of their way to help that person who wouldn’t ever shut up about how awesome they are and how many other offers they got and how hard it was to choose because they’re so impressed with them. People roll their eyes at that person and try to avoid talking to them again. People go out of their way to help the person who worked together with them on some project that neither of them remember, but they had a fun rivalry going on the Tetris machine at the office.",

        "body": "I'd just say this -- it's easy to think that the entire world goes through you staying at your current company, but you actually have options. Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.Therefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: \"This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager\". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations. IMO, it says there's a blind spot in your understanding of where you fit into the workplace, and therefore I'd encourage you to sit down 1v1 with the lead and get their opinion on whether or not you're on track, or what else you could do.",

In addition, it provides you with two extras: Remaining employed, chance to turn things in your favour. Make sure you commit to realistic expectation in PIP.

It’s important to recognize that the quant job market is significantly different than just SWE/tech job market in some key ways. Culture, working hours, stress, and sustainability of your career should be considerations. Can you handle joining an investment firm then getting the axe a year or two later? Can you handle one or two years of garden leave due to non-competes? Can you handle being restricted by non-disclosure agreement?Anywho, I know Wells Fargo and PIMCO is huge out west. All the regular developers I know who work on securities pricing, risk reporting, trading systems, or otherwise more business-activity related platforms seem pretty secure in their jobs, if overworked. Although the American banks, at least, love a good layoff (eyes on you Goldman). IMO it’s great having a $$$ cash bonus at the end of every year while not being on the front line for layoffs relatively (suck it bankers, quants, researchers, and sales traders!). Maybe it’d be easier to skill build and lateral into a business-related developer role (ex. Java Algo Dev, E-Trading Dev, Low-Latency Trading Systems Dev, etc) than get a grad degree just to work on capital markets technology again?Definitely get in touch with recruiters and headhunters. See McGregor-Boyall or Stanford Black to name a few. Network on LinkedIn with these agencies or consultancies and interview grind yourself into a new job.",

I ended up leaving for a 20% pay bump but I saw it as an investment to my future. WHAT I WISH I HAD DONE was to go back and get my masters or another degree in management or something like that to make myself more versatile/valuable. I had so much free time that I could have done school work in between meetings and still gotten all of my daily tasks done. Literally the day I signed my offer letter for the new job, my friend was like “you should have gone back to school if you had so much free time”. I regretted not thinking about that sooner!",

No need to disclose it during an application. But since you say you don't need accommodations and it wouldn't impact your work much, there is zero reason to disclose it. Most employers will always look at a disability as a negative, and as a hindrance. It can and will be used against you.

There would be real concern that you're flaky. I know one of them is a contract role, but unfortunately it's a common white lie these days for a short stint. Additionally for your current role, some of your accomplishments are tough to believe simply because of how little time it's been. I think you'll have more luck with a little more time under your belt.",

        "body": "The only tip I can give is maybe list the skill used at each place. It's what I do and I guess it works for me because I've always been doing that and it seems to work for me. Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for \"git\" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do \"managed projects with git\" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.Also, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about \"non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.And also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.Anyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative. And it's probably even harder with the economy contracting. But I started my career at the start of the great recession, so there's some hope it's not as bad as that.",

Recruiters and interviewers don't want to read a huge amount, particularly for a junior, and just look for keywords. AI can help make things briefer - just make sure you double-check what it produces. Some of the tools you used there can just be listed and probably don't need to be in a sentence.Also, I have little idea about what you actually worked on. Seems almost like buzz words in both the companies and the projects. That could use a slightly clearer explanation at the reduction of other things (as mentioned above). Think of how you would explain it to your mum/dad or a 6 year old. Many recruiters aren't technical, and even engineers don't know every field.For skills you list tools but are there any interesting algorithms or patterns you know?Having only a couple of months and then looking for a new role can be something recruiters occasionally pass due to being risk-adverse. They don't give you a chance to explain. However, having some experience is better than none. If you can hang in at your current company long enough, then it'll start to look better.Any awards, papers etc...?Keeping it at one page is good.",

Getting good working on legacy systems is its own skill set and provides a lot of job security and opportunity if you are.But the first question is what is the leaderships understanding and support to make the situation better? Are they receptive to tactical investments in tech debt? And second question is do you have the appropriate technical lead to help drive a vision and technical plan to dig out of the hole? This is hard and many are not cut for it, preferring to create plans to burn it all down for something new. Lastly, I hate to say, but just wanting to be a mundane ticket taker is neither good or fun for you long term. You should develop opinions and strategies for how to make things better. This field is getting more competitive and saturated and if you can’t put out more than the exact minimum effort to not get fired, you are going to be left behind in this field eventually.",

I'll comment on the CS path first since I know it.If you want to work in CS, AWS Developer Associate is okay to get. Not foundational / practitioner as software developer. Cert won't get any jobs but has a small chance of getting you to the interview stage and helping you with a design problem. Master's in Data Science is a worthless degree. A Master's in CS is useless except either **a)** you can land a paid internship and co-op in CS to reset yourself **b)** reset a long work gap where you feel recruiters are discriminating **c)** you don't actually learn CS with the CS degree or work experienceDoing QA work and deployments, it's more or less a dying job for Americans and has been so for years. Why Cognizant does it, was POS IBM where I was. Newer trend is make the developers do the tester job as well for the same pay. All of a sudden I was coding and deploying my own code with responsibility for all levels of testing. Violates segregation of duty and forces me on 45-50 hours weeks but saves the man money.If you still want to go this route and build on your work experience, yeah the cert is probably okay and degree probably works the same way in that it's a calculated risk. Less a risk if the degree is fully funded. You can do Multivariate Calculus. The shock value ended in Calc II. Nice part is taking the derivative of one variable, you treat the other variable as a constant and it doesn't matter what order you take derivatives in.",

So my intent in pursuing these is just for learning something fruitful, then I can hopefully build my own projects to show some competency on my own.I hear what you're saying about the Data Science Master's, it isn't much on its own and actual experience matters. But I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job, as the saying goes, so that's why I considered this. Rutgers also offers a Master's in Business and Science which combines data analytics and business courses, but having to fund it myself, fully or partially, I dunno I just don't want to bother with school again, now that I think about it more. Also for calculus, I haven't touched it in well over 5 years, neither at work nor school, basically forgot everything, so that's why I am so hesitant about that part.Companies expecting people to be a jack-of-all-trades just so they can save money is an irritating trend. If I were a greedy CEO I'd probably understand, but as someone who just wants enough of a salary to live comfortably, it gets on my nerves. But that's how this field is, the ones who are willing to adapt in the race to the bottom will succeed.I'll stick with the self-learning path then, for now. It's the most doable at this point.",

No training on hiring or evaluating, but I wasn't interviewing for that position. I just took it not because I wanted it, but because I was 3 days away from being laid off due to bench expiration, so it allowed me to get a paycheck still. Fortunately for me, I actually was rather good at it, as I had been a teacher before and know how to evaluate and ask higher order thinking questions, so I did a hierarchy starting with basic easy questions, and then questions such as walk me through how you would design a Spring Boot service given a specific need, and even if they didn't do it the way I would, I'd at least know they knew what they were doing. However, if I didn't put any thought into it, I could have been like the others and just did a google search for common interview questions. Very few of the candidates knew the first thing about what Spring Boot does or how to make a React component. We were mostly campus hires that were hired just for having heard of stuff before, and training was canceled early due the company cutting funding, so it was everyone fend for themselves for a year watching Udemy and doing our own stuff.",

With all the layoffs, I believe total compensation has been dropping. Add to that some companies are doing poorly, you could argue the raises and promotions you've been receiving are a good thing, especially relative to the market. But a major factor is how your current company is performing. It feels like you're doing pretty well given the current market, but it's your right/decision to want more.

They won't ask HR for a reference, HR is just there to confirm your title and dates of employment for a background check. I've also never heard of a company asking HR about \"reason for leaving\", I *really* doubt HR would be willing to answer that even if they knew. At most they might say \"fired\" or \"left of their own accord\". The more details HR gives, the more liable the company becomes at no benefit to them. That's something they may ask *you*, but definitely not HR.So that said, the exit survey is something only HR is going to see and care about. Answer it, don't answer, lie, tell the truth, it's not really gonna matter. In no world is HR going to respond to a background check saying \"Yeah, pinkbutterfly22 was great, but they didn't fill out their exit survey so we wouldn't recommend you hire them\". HR is going to strictly say \"pinkbutterfly22 worked as a SWE from X to Y\".I personally don't tell the company where I'm going, or even the real reason of why I'm leaving. I don't *lie*, I just give non-answers. \"I was just looking for a new adventure\" or some BS for why I'm leaving. For where I'm going \"To a \\[large/small\\] company in \\[industry\\]\" is the most I ever give. I don't really like lying, but I have no issue with dodging questions. When I give that response they know what's up, and don't dig.As for your manager/co-workers, *those* are the people that'll be giving you references because you give your new company their contact info directly. From their perspective, as long as you were decent to work with, and you put in your 2 weeks notice, no bridge is burnt. That's all you're really obligated to do. If you think your colleagues that you hated wouldn't give you a reference... don't ask. Only ask for references from people that you know will say good things about you.",

A MSCS without experience usually can only be considered as 1 yoe, so even if you ace all the interviews, the HC will question the decision. If they approve, they’ll lowball the shit out of your offer, basically around 240k for SDE2. To get a better comp you’ll need data to back that up.I’d ask the recruiter more about the role and try to gauge the HM. Dont let the SDE2 title fool you and join a shithole.",

Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.So I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.Niche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too. So now basically I have to maintain the knowledge of 4 stacks knowing that the amount of jobs I can apply to won't even compare to many of friends who have experience with only Java or Nodejs. For the current company, I've been more involved with the hiring process and the amount of Python/Ruby devs are still very few and far between. I guess the upside is that I know for sure I don't have to worry much about unemployment anymore. Take this as an anecdote, it might not applicable to your situation, nonetheless, good luck out there!",

Would you be able to confirm if that's correct?\" As for other parts of the offer, it's common to negotiate sign-on bonuses and annual bonuses. The general rule is to not ask for too much - 10-20% above their offered amount is usually safe. So if they offer $20K, you could try asking for $24K or $22K.One thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to the interview and suggests responses in real time.

Had pretty bad undergrad gpa from some earlier years (I left and returned to college 3 years later) at a really low ranked college, but still wanted to do my PhD at T50. I couldn't qualify for a lot of internships because of GPA requirements, but with a masters I could since it would just go off that GPA. I also wanted to work some a federal job. So doing my masters now at school T100 school with a 4.0 and currently in the interview process for a job with my dream federal agency where if I get I'll start at GS-7 (56k) and once I finish my masters I'll go to GS-9 (69k). The hiring manager actually seemed interested cause AI is designated as mission critical for the US government and my concentration for my masters is AI/ML. I guess with the lower pay and it being several hours from a large metro that it's harder to find young workers. Plus they said they'd help me get my PhD if I got the job which would put me at GS-11 for 84k.If it would actually be needed for the path you want to follow then go for it. But outside of a federal job pay boost or wanting to do research it may not help. Plus you sound like you dont want to do it.",

Too many selfish people not thinking about people less fortunate, animals, the environment, etc. is why we're in this mess and in many cases, going backwards.That said for Comp Sci I'd say most likely C and C++ mainly for Embedded with potentially Rust and Zig and there's Python for A.I. Hate to be yet another \"A.I\" person and sound like I'm shilling, but the reality is the tech is going to be a big game changer, even more than it is now imo. We simply don't know when, if we'll ever get it to that level of A.G.I, but even if we don't get there this will help lead to many breakthroughs along the way. NVIDIA recently cracked the genome. Their A.I is actually able to build lifeforms with unique features/genetics and traits. Stuff like that is a gamechanger and that's what A.I brings.",
