While that’s certainly true at many large companies like Meta or Amazon where you’re basically slinging SQL and little else, it’s most certainly not true at companies like Capital One or Airbnb or Netflix; there, your job is practically 1:1 with software engineering. That being said, a great percentage of DE’s need to study DSA, time/memory complexity, and CS fundamentals, instead of memorizing frameworks and assuming everything’s Gucci. It’s the fundamentals that evidently are the “hard stuff”.To provide an actual metric that illustrates what I mean: at a company I will not name, I encountered a legacy process that took 55 hours but was reduced to 6.5 seconds, as well as ~5x less memory allocation, simply by using Aho-Corasick instead of regex, parallelization instead of serialization, and basic optimizations using concepts like “tidy data” and sets. That’s the difference between throwing SQL at everything and knowing when certain tools and techniques apply best or worst.",

You often need to ensure your pipelines will work (or at least fail gracefully) with bad data and not hang with huge amounts of data.You also have to deal with external APIs or flat file transfers where your assumptions will be based on the documentation the external party provides. You quickly come to realise this documentation is often old or just plain incorrect so building a test suite on it is a lesson on futility.This is obviously much harder to do than writing unit tests of your own code and when the pressures mount of delivering integrations and new data products to the business mount, testing can often fall by the wayside with data engineers falling back on \"we'll test it in live!\".This, compounded by the fact that setting up a testing environment that truly represents your production database/data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming all combine to mean tests are a much less rigourously followed discipline in data engineering.Does that mean you should skip them altogether? Absolutely not, but ensuring you have 100% unit test code coverage is not nearly as valuable as ensuring a complex pipeline has a decent set of integration and stress tests for, say, 75% of its functionality.The reality is that most data engineers will be lucky to get anywhere near that, which is almost certainly why they were impressed you wrote tests at all. It should mean that you approach the challenges above with the right mindset, rather than just avoiding them because testing is hard on data engineering.",

Source database keep changing their entities and fields, so that we ```SELECT``` from the wrong columns,2. Data that we expect… are more mendacious than we anticipated.3. Sometimes, data is forbidden from us because these data are personally-identifiable information and we have to first deploy our ETL pipelines first, so that our business users/customers verify that our SQL statements are correct and generate the right output.Unit tests are largely useful if you want to enforce a culture of \"make sure you cover your asses first.\" In a large corporate or public sector environment, however, we exploit gaps in either technical or structural (i.e. \"the data is not cleansed properly\") situations to push back effort.Is this bad? Absolutely. Companies and public sectors, however, care not about holistic software development (remember how **hard** it is to employ *zero trust model* as a way to develop our software, let alone ETL pipelines?).",

GenAI will allow these folks to tackle new, complex problems as simpler & more-rote work gets automated.

Simple enough. He couldn’t get it to work. Found out he used Gemini to generate the code…which was riddled with errors. The intern showed a poor understanding of the assignment and an absolute reliance on AI.Another example: we get CSV dumps from financial organizations daily. One of the orgs had changed their CSV specs without informing us. It broke our pipeline, which led to garbage data being loaded, which led to dashboards being broken. Fixing this problem required long conversations with that org, their techs, our DBA, our DevOps. We had to manually reload the files before the breakage, update our ETL code, update our Snowflake table and our dashboards.

The only podcast I've found that actually seems interesting is Roaring Elephant which I don’t think it’s very well known but it’s two guys with experience in the field giving their take on new developments. What I like most about it is that they call out the bullshit when they see it. They’re very skeptical about a lot of things. Perks of having experience in the field, I would say. They also cover some more niche topics like open source and such. Pretty cool and episodes are not very long, which I also appreciate",

My team DE's use DBT heavily for the data pipeline work, without data models, they cannot build proper structured pipelines. Data Models are the foundations for any OLTP and OLAP systems, they are systems, tools and applications agnostics. Few tweaks here and there but for most part, a strong base model can be plugged into any application. Data Vault has got more popularity in Europe than in North America, but it'll take sometime for companies to adopt it. I sometimes feel that the art of data modeling is a long forgotten skill. My team tech lead comes from traditional ETL background and has done lot of modeling in his past. I still spend lot of time on the model naming conventions and establishing proper standards. Every field when read the first time should for most part convey a business meaning, inform users of what type of data it might be storing rather than guessing games.",

That being said, I largely agree with the overall idea of points 1 and 3 for a lack of unit testing- the upstream data is too unpredictable for it to be useful and the expected outputis (or should be) driven by the stakeholders ever evolving business rules. Data engineers often work within a data platorm or framework, so I am not sure what is being built where an integration test would be useful beyond valdiating results in a Dev and/or UAT environment.

In my experience (mostly feeding business/analytics reports) having good tests for business logic is more useful than technical testing (like is this column nullable or unique, etc) because I'm trying to minimize scenarios where the data pipelines succeed but the numbers make no sense to business people and then the business complains or stops trusting the numbers. And I find a decent amount of issues with technical data quality will be noticeable immediately, like if you try to upsert with a duplicate PK, the pipeline will fail and you'll get a notification. It seems like you have the perspective of a DE working in a tech minded company where tech/software is the product, so it makes sense to have the highest possible software quality. This is not the case for all non software companies, where having old and shitty software is the norm and asking for budget increases gets you laughed out of the room. This culture filters down into who gets hired and what tools get used, so the business ends up with worse quality engineering talent all else equal. Sometimes that blows up in the business's face, other times nothing bad happens for years. Those DEs probably aren't going to write tests because they don't see the benefits, are too lazy, are overworked, or don't have the budget (or some other excuse). idk if that answers your question but i think it describes reality a bit better than the strawman arguments the earlier commenters provided",

When you’re developing, it’s natural to just want to run an SQL statement and see the output, and it’s not that straightforward when you’ve got a template and model jargon.You have to template your code out to parameterize every input and output. Then you have to figure out how you’re going to get your test cases hooked up in there. Tools like dbt and sqlmesh don’t feel like they scale all that well imo, and it’s odd to store database tables to test as yaml.Plus some more head scratchers about how you’re going to make ephemeral and idempotent tests, and separate environments.

        "body": "I've been working on (and failing at, honestly) getting data engineers to adopt proper testing practices for ten years. Here's what I've observed:1.     **Legacy Systems and Technical Debt** Many organizations are stuck with legacy data architectures - monolithic data warehouses, batch ETL processes built years ago - that are incredibly difficult to modernize. The technical debt from years of ad hoc development makes implementing proper testing and observability feel like trying to retrofit a Formula 1 engine into a horse-drawn carriage. Migrating to modern cloud-native stacks requires significant investment that many companies aren't willing to make.2.     **Lack of Data Engineering Maturity** This is the big one. Most companies still treat data engineering as a back-office function rather than a core engineering discipline. You end up with a mess of one-off scripts, undocumented workflows, and manual interventions everywhere. Very few data teams practice basic software engineering principles like CI/CD, proper testing, or version control for their pipelines.3.     **Resistance to Cultural Change** Data teams have historically worked in silos - engineers, analysts, scientists, and business teams all doing their own thing. DataOps requires breaking down these silos and adopting agile methodologies, which is genuinely disruptive to existing workflows. Leadership has to drive this cultural shift, but most executives don't understand data engineering well enough to know what needs to change.  You need to test at every point on the data joureny4.     **Tooling Complexity & Vendor Overload** The data tooling landscape is overwhelming. Every vendor promises to solve all your problems, but integrating everything into a coherent, testable system is a nightmare.5.     **Lack of Automated Testing & Observability** This is where we really fail compared to software engineering. Data teams still rely on manual SQL checks instead of automated data quality pipelines. We have open source tools now - Great Expectations, , dbt tests, and my company's DataOps Data Quality TestGen - but adoption is still painfully slow.6.     **The Meaning of \"Testing\" is Confusing** This one drives me crazy. When software engineers talk about testing, they mean unit tests, integration tests, etc. that run during development and deployment. But in data engineering, \"testing\" could mean: Testing your code logic during development (like software engineers do), Testing data quality when new data arrives in production, Testing data at various points in the produict process.7.     **Do you test in development when code changes, or in production when data changes? The answer is YES to both**, but most teams don't distinguish between these different types of testing. This confusion leads to either over-engineering development tests or completely ignoring runtime data quality checks. We need both static code testing AND dynamic data testing, but the industry hasn't standardized the terminology or tooling around this distinction.8.     **Regulatory & Compliance Challenges** Compliance requirements often prioritize audit trails over engineering best practices, creating friction around automation.9.     **Lack of Executive Buy-In & ROI Justification** It's hard to quantify the ROI of \"preventing data disasters that haven't happened yet.\" Executives see testing as overhead rather than insurance.The frustrating part is that we know how to solve these problems - the tools and methodologies exist. But changing organizational culture and overcoming years of technical debt is incredibly difficult. It's like trying to rebuild a plane while it's flying.",

If I really want I can also pick data projects more leaning towards DS, Data analytics and even data governance. A lot of development jobs are maintaining large enterprise applications which isn't the most interesting to me, if you're unlucky you get a project maintaining or rewriting legacy systems, I almost lost a team of 5 colleagues from the java department because the project simply was not fun.I like programming but I don't like it that much to only do that and consistently keep up the programming skills, the combination of cloud, data & AI with modern technology and arguably the safest job now is mainly what keeps me interested.",

I would say if you like gaming and you are an engineer, you are very likely to enjoy this game. Anedotally, I have yet to meet somebody who meets those criteria who doesn’t like factorio (or satisfactory for that matter). Note, if you don’t like gaming already then I am not sure.Why is this the case? At its core its about automating things!You basically have to create logistics pipelines that take raw materials, put them through various stages of processing to make things that can then be used to make other things. You have particular objectives that grow in complexity as the game goes on. In the beginning you can get away with a spaghetti pipeline, but as the game goes on and complexity ramps up, it essentially forces you how to think modularly and in terms of abstractions and interfaces. So instead of working at the level of single processing units, you will eventually need to think at the level of many different processing units. Then you have to think through input rate, output rate etc etc. Other challenges you have to account for is being able to take input resources from different places as they run out! And it also has a bit of pragmatism in that in the core game mode you also have to defend yourself against aliens (product / manager analogy) so you can’t just put everything into building the perfect factory, also needs to be able to defend itself quickly.Hope that gives you some idea!",

They repartition 2000 when the dataset is 300mb only.I have optimized code taking stuff from 1 hour to 5 minutes. Some places use spark for small data, use it like a db manager of sorts.Spark is completely fine. People should just learn how and when to use it. I think other stuff may seem faster but that's because they have a single use case, so it's less prone to be used wrong.",

Makes it easier to do governance in big companies.No one cares if your small data runs in 3 minutes or 30 seconds. If you need this kinda of performance just go for streaming.BI querys is a different story and I think people are not using vanilla spark for that",

I can do it on local hardware behind the corporate firewall, foregoing cumbersome compliance and cyber approvals. I send them emails and they say alright fine whatever. Your perspective is needlessly narrow. Consider what you could do with extremely low cost analysts scurrying over your data like ants. What could you build? How could you add value? AI is not a single thing. It’s a constellation of technologies that take arbitrary text input and produce varying degrees of so-called intelligent output. It’s not a hammer. It’s a bag of hammers.

JSON has terrible types and was rarely validated by anything but client endpoints, but it was desirable by the necessity of the IT fashion of the time, therefore validation had to be given up (and given a silly name that made it sound more respectable), and this propagated into everywhere JSON metastasized itself.Nowdays, thankfully, we have passed the point when we think every app will be rewritten in Javascript and DE especially has far superior formats like parquet and such and we can put 'schema on read' into the historical dustbin where it belongs (I'm sure one person will chime in with how they do eleventy billion events per day from over 9000 devices with 4,223 different formats or ingests random pdfs or whatever and they can't possibly validate or define schemas on the way in and so on, so if you actually have those requirements fine, but schema-on-read always has to be argued for as something specifically needed, not some generally good practice)",

It seems like polars can do pretty much anything that pandas can do, but faster, as long as there isn’t a strict requirement for pandas. So if you need to write AWS lambda functions that ingest files from excel files, and convert them to some other format, you could use polars. Note that this data ISN’T in the database yet. As for the scripts mentioned above, I may want/need to explore the contents of a file before I load it into my database. Or just pull some summary metrics for one file to compare them to the loaded data.As for why you might load data onto your local machine…cost, maybe? Running things on your local machine is basically free. Or maybe you want to do some joining and analysis with a data set that isn’t in the database, and would be annoying to get in there—that annoyance could be engineering based or it could be due to workplace policies.I’ll leave you with the thought that there’s a million ways to skin the cat, and engineers are constantly inventing new ones.I could—and do—convert files using glue in Fargate, and sometimes I crawl data in S3 using Athena. Gotta do the math to see what’s the right tool for the job. And sometimes you just do something like polars or pandas because it’s dead simple, quick, and reliable.",

For that data, I'd rather be working with traditional data warehouses / lakes and point to point integrations.

Introducing that data into a fabric environment makes a little more sense to me.

You are doing ELT by the sound of things: your python script extracts and loads the data, then your MySQL views transform it. Your MySQL DB is your data warehouse, by the sound of things. A simple one in relative terms, but simple is good so long as it meets your needs. Some orgs need a much more complex data warehouse.Apache Spark is probably what you're thinking of for Apache: it's a software system for using multiple computers to do a computational task, instead of being restricted to the hardware of just one computer. Many lower-spec computers can outperform and outprice one big one, for some workloads.BigQuery is one of Google's data tools - I think roughly like spark but I'm not super familiar with it.Data Factory probably refers to Microsoft's data tools: Azure Data Factory and its spiritual successor, Fabric Data Factory. These are components of wider data architecture in the Microsoft/Azure/Fabric ecosystem, for creating 'pipelines', which are just conceptual sequences of different tasks depending on one another. Pipelines typically have a code representation but are often also able to be visualised and edited via a GUI.ETA: I don't think you are at all new to data engineering, you just didn't realise you were doing it :slightly_smiling_face:",

The 3rd edition is the most recent, possibly the last (Kimball is firmly retired now IIRC), definitely the version to buy (substantial additions over 2nd edition) and still as relevant as 1996. It's not all that technical, it's really more about concepts, approaches, and best practices. There's a bit of SQL but it's not all about code.",

Why SSoT for metrics / semantic layer? Etc etc. These are super hard to explain until you can demonstrate the consequences of not doing them. So naturally, people will lump them into the same boat as shiny new features designed to churn profit. Good thing is, with AI everyone is suddenly open to change if it helps them implement AI. Bad news is, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors (like reselling chatgpt or throwing AI at bad data) that will make it harder to convince people of change if/when it crashes.",

Here are my two cents:**Guardrails** are the easiest to implement, e.g. check the output table has the same number of records as the input, or that the right side of the join has no duplicate keys, to avoid multiplying records.The idea is to fail the processing when these checks fail and don't process the wrong data.I once implemented such a check in one of the apps and forgot about it - it never failed. Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong. **Regression testing** could be the most rewarding. The idea is simple: produce two versions of a table, before and after applying the changes. Then compare them record by record, see what doesn't match, and try to understand why.These two require the least investment from you yet bring immediate value.",

This means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. But achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. But, the myth of \"we will fix it in post\" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. Most analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the \"people pipeline\", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. But, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints. Bonus shortcut, just exclude all records that fail the test and magically your pipeline never fails. Business will think you're a rockstar! I strongly encourage KYD.",

Unless your datasets are very deterministic or doesn’t change a lot I wouldn’t go there. Unless there’s an action do to on your end if you receive a new value.You can test for data continuity (try to find holes). That help a lot. Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common. For example at the moment you rely on s3 events, you’ve just lost your ordering. Can be interesting to build things in order but also to find missing data.And like you said, build test right (closer to your business domain tables), then shift left (closer to the source of data) anytime it’s possible. It’s usually easier to build a test that apply to a specific domain use case because you know what you want and expect. And it’s always better to test closer to the source.",

        "body": "First of all, what you're describing is a classical OLTP use case, but Snowflake is an OLAP database. First and foremost, the issue with using Snowflake is the response time. With 100k+ requests, you're probably looking for sub-second response times. However, even with lots of optimization, this isn't what Snowflake excels at.Regarding pricing: As you pay mainly for storage and warehouse uptime, there are no specific caveats. Regarding scaling, it would possibly make more sense to scale-out (more XS warehouses to serve requests in parallel). What we did is performing the transformations in Snowflake and export a denormalized table, and imported it into a Postgres. Which achieves <100 ms response times for 50+ attributes per record paginated with 100 records out of 1.5b records even on a very small configuration. However, within the last 12 months, a couple of things changed:1. Introduction of hybrid tables allowing Snowflake to perform better on OLTP tasks - we haven't tried this out yet as we are on Azure, and hybrid tables are on GA only on AWS2. Snowflake's recent aquisition of Crunchy Data and the announcement of Snowflake Postgres - we are waiting for news hereEDIT: Spelling & grammarEDIT 2: corrected Crunchy Data",

You don't always see the effort others put in, and people who go down the road of attacking their superiors are almost always wrong, and usually get blacklisted or fired, so keep your head down and focus on your own work. Again, not sure if this is your tone, but the advice stands in case it's ever relevant.2. Get the idea of \"X hours worked\" out of your head now while you're hourly (Even though that is your whole world as an intern). You are all there to perform a service -- if that service is performed in 30 hours per week, then 10 hours is spent doing useless busywork to appear productive. But you'll have plenty of times when there's an emergency deadline and you're pulling 60 hours, that's what \"exempt\" (salary) means. You say you see them leave early, but did you see them crash on the couch in the lobby during the audit last year?3. There are no gold stars, rewards, raises, or bonuses for working harder/longer than contractually obligated. Especially at a company of 3,700 employees. And even more especially as a DE, your contributions will go with little more than a \"Thanks!\" if not completely unnoticed. The only time you will be \"seen\" is when something goes *wrong*, like a plumber or electrician.TLDR: Keep your head down, do your job, and hope that your future in DE is as \"relaxed\" as you seem to think it might be.",

Ideally you also have tests that can be run before you deploy into a test/integration environment, and more tests that you can run before you merge your code to the main branch.Tests should be done as early as is reasonably possible, to detect errors and issues as soon as possible, so that people waste as little time as possible creating and then hunting down and fixing defects.These tests are built on certain assumptions, positive or negative, then 'Given [x] When [y] Then [z]'. DQ checks are there to catch when your assumptions on 'given' and 'when' don't hold -- something gave you nulls when it shouldn't, or some new code value came in for a column that didn't exist before, or some formatted number had a format change. You can't check the output for various features to detect if something went horribly wrong, and you can halt the process or quarantine some data so that it doesn't corrupt everything.But those DQ processes should themselves be tested. Do they correctly identify certain scenarios and actually halt the process (or do whatever other mitigating action you specify). Otherwise, where's the confidence that they actually work?",

It could be directly from a source system, from a curated lake are, data model, or a cleansed area. The idea is to drive a feedback loop to upstream and downstream systems by engaging data stewards to enact process, behaviour or policy change to drive long term improvements in quality. Sometimes it may be possible to directly integrate with these systems to automatically enact change/fixes, but this should always be done with a person to approve. The point is, what you describe are two different concepts entirely, and are not comparable in any way.

Of course you can do a lot of smart stuff; partitioning the data per day and such.

When a schema change for column addition is needed, we make sure they're ok for us to add columns without changes on their end, and do so. Once that data is ready, they can make changes on their end to bring in the new column(s). Avoiding coordinated change windows is the key, because it causes immense difficulty when working across teams.If a column is being removed, we essentially do the reverse. Downstream removes their dependency on it, then we remove it. If this ever has to be inverted, then the new first-moving team needs to set up a view or some other 'dummy' mechanism to spoof the presence of the data, so that they can make their change now and let the other team catch up later.For ingestion we make use of lake storage -- we capture raw data and raw files, exactly as upstream provides them. We read the data as long as it is compatible, it does not have to be identical, but we do flag for changes in schema as they will need to be addressed. After read, we write to conformed tables that use a schema we set, so we can add in dummy data or drop columns as needed. Ideally upstream works with us and provides two copies when a change is happening, one in the old schema and another in the new, then we can switch over at any point (ie they are first mover in this scenario).",

A few common techniques I've seen work well across teams:\\- **Column add detection**: Regularly diffing source schemas against warehouse schemas and generating DDLs to add new columns automatically (or semi-automatically via approval workflows). \\- **Soft typing**: Especially for NoSQL sources, coercing all incoming values into strings or JSON blobs to prevent type errors when a field starts varying in type across records. \\- **Schema registry-backed ingestion:** For streaming systems like Kafka, using Avro or Protobuf with a schema registry to enforce compatibility at the producer level. \\- **Shadow tables for testing**: Syncing to a shadow dataset before applying schema changes to prod, so you can monitor how ingestion and downstream transforms behave.A lot of it comes down to how much control you have over upstream sources and how comfortable you are automating schema enforcement downstream.I work at [Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit), and one thing we do is automatically handle schema evolution in-flight—even inferring types for NoSQL sources and alerting teams when schema changes are detected. It's been interesting to see how much pain this saves folks once things scale.",

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes. \\- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.The setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.The crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.If you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.The more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.Lastly, a few questions to keep in mind: \\- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system? \\- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues? \\- What is your tolerance level for false positives? \\- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?None of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else. But they are expensive, and there are mostly false positives.",

But of course, you might have your reasons. Also, dbt only had community supporter SQL Server connectors, which can be fine, but if the community stops supporting it, you might fall behind on versions quickly (this happened for a while around the second half of 2023). Nothing of immediate concern, but something you may want to keep in mind.A while ago I had similar requirements but used Dagster on a VM for orchestration and hosting dbt (also storing data in blob storage), so I avoided Azure Data Factory and Azure Functions. I don't think this is a better or worse approach, but it's an alternative to reach a similar goal.

Is you data movement resilient to schema change in order to garantee you move data to a persistent sink as per requirements? Is you etl/elt support by ci/cd, is it automated on triggers (any type) is it costs effective and does it handle increased volume without exploding costs /time? It sounds like. The answer to all of those would be either a \"yes\" or a \"it could be made to easily\" Your pipeline sounds great, good on you for using function app to handle different and varying api calls rather than making something over complex.",

        "body": "Your architecture has a solid foundation, leveraging Azure's capabilities effectively. Using Azure Functions to handle different API endpoints is beneficial for scalability, while Azure Blob Storage serves as a flexible intermediary. However, consider integrating Azure Data Lake for more efficient data storage and retrieval, especially if data volume grows. Using dbt to manage transformations is great, as it provides modularity and enhanced version control, but ensure proper testing and documentation of SQL procedures to avoid potential pitfalls. Automating more aspects of your pipeline, like error handling and monitoring through Azure Monitor, could also improve robustness.Your pipeline design appears efficient, but here are some areas for improvement. Directly loading JSON into staging tables is fine, but you might want to explore the use of [Delta Lake](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/how-to-create-delta-live-tables-in-azure-databricks?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit) for its ACID transactional integrity and improved efficiency in handling large datasets. Additionally, you can enhance the scalability of your Azure Functions by moving them to Azure Kubernetes Service if your function apps face heavy workloads. Incorporating better data validation mechanisms before data transformation can save time troubleshooting downstream inaccuracies. Finally, enhancing your logging and monitoring setup, possibly integrating [Azure Log Analytics](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/building-data-pipelines-with-azure-synapse-analytics?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit), will provide better insights and faster response times to issues that may arise.",

And since you are just ingesting data into DWH, most likely you don't need to write raw ingestion code -- and even if you do, it is going to be way smaller scale than Netflix.Basically the task falls into two parts:\\- Gathering requirements from stakeholders and make sure you clarify every question before moving into implementation stage. It's difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on the quality of the stakeholders, most of whom don't know what they want anyway.\\- Put up tests, alerts and monitoring into each pipeline.That's pretty much it. Apparently the people part is way more important and difficult than the technical part. It's essentially sort of BI analyst job.Oh and good luck on Fabric.",

If you can jump straight to analytics engineer, that would be even better.I argue data engineering is a role you go into after you get experience in the software engineering space and want to specialize, or you come from a data role and want to have more of an engineering focus (I went from data science to data engineering myself).Agree with others that Python, SQL, and dbt are going to be the best use of your time. Especially dbt for analytics engineering roles.Another thing to note is that I'm seeing Typescript come up A LOT for AI deployments. I'm strongly considering learning typescript myself because of this. I would definitely prioritize python over this, but if I had to choose another language after python and SQL, I would personally choose typescript.Finally, your work on MSE is a huge advantage if you position yourself right. You now have domain knowledge in manufacturing. Having such may lower the barrier of entry into a role. For example, I had a clinical research and health insurance background which helped me get my first data science role at a health tech company.Hope this helps!",

SQL Server DBA here so I know exactly what you’re talking about :smirking_face: Well, not the DuckLake parts but the rest of it :smirking_face: Like where’s the equivalent of an SSDT project here?!Take a look at SQLMesh. It supports and/or replaces dbt. It has column type tracking / lineage between all of those databases and a few more!To summarise, you define a SQL model in SQLMesh (just a file with a select statement… model (name xxx); select blah from y), it works out what the source tables are by querying the source database, and caches them in a yaml file (it’s also a one command line to regenerate this at any time, so it’s no big deal at all, you can also easily parse it by hand or script because it’s so basic, literally just the table name column name and data type). Now for any more references to those tables or that model or other models and nested models etc it tracks the lineage downwards. If you have it materialize the views it calculates all the data types of the tables to create, or you can also manually define and override them, or keep the whole thing as just views.It has a VS Code extension that shows you all of the column types in your models while you’re coding, too. It has an API (of sorts) you can call to scrape it into other applications as well (but that part is a bit funny; because you need to run it in UI mode which opens a local 8080 port, and you query that… easier than it sounds).Anyway have a look just to see if it does what you want. One last thing though. F MAX column types in SQL Server :grinning_face_with_sweat: Those are LOB types so every single row query will cause an additional lookup for every LOB column in it. That quickly *kills* performance even in a data warehouse :grinning_face_with_sweat: Oh it’s okay for CSV files and stuff where you can’t be sure what the limits are… I get that part… but in general it’s a big no :grinning_face_with_sweat:",

        "body": "It's a fair question. There were a few reasons I preferred this approach 1. The inability in dbt contracts of being able to do varchar(n) max length type checks - I come from a MS SQL server backgorund and am used to defining max field lengths for most text columns. This one is interesting though - I'm going to be using postgres for the database for the first time and I have just realised the strict varchar(n) types I'm useed to aren't really needed for the majority of columns because text / varchar data types will suffice - so it's less of a concern now. 2. I saw it as likely being a better debugging experience to pick up schema errors by tests (rather than using contracts which prevent the models from creating - although I get it that's what you'd want to happen). I'll also be creating other tests for expected values etc, so having all tests implemented the same way I saw as a cleaner apprach3. I just don't like the amount of yaml that gets created to implement schema checks via contracts (I think this is actually my biggest gripe). My first ingest pipeline has 30 files and some of them have 60+ columns - that is a lot of yaml needed not to mention dbt best practsies suggest putting it all in a single schema.yml file! That sounds a PITA for developers to maintain. Diffing metadata .schema changes in a small seed file is easy.",

I save the data from each task as files to blob storage and then ingest the data from these files to delta tables. If the calls were independent of each other I would let them run in parallel, depending on the compute resources I have access to.

You don't ever link one fact table directly to another. You traverse the model via one or more dimensions that the two facts have in common. (Those common dimensions might include degenerate dims like a contract number, perhaps. If so, the DD should be un-degenerated (!) back to a very narrow true dimension table, with surrogate keys in all the relevant fact tables.)You should work on that Product dimension before the facts, at least to get the basic approach and structure sorted, if row-by-row matching will take time. You can use tools like splink to figure out the links, potentially.(Unless they are actually different unrelated products? Like the contract is for a finished car, but the invoice is for components like engine block, axle, brake disk, etc. If so, Product and Component are probably two separate dimensions.)",

But you should still model the fact separately from the dimension, because the dimensional part is equally relevant to attach to other facts like Invoices.",

That’s how I made the transition work pretty seamlessly. Obviously I spent lots of time outside of work learning on the side but here was the career path I took:Manufacturing engineer: I had a few roles before this that were more design focused and even though I hated manufacturing it was vital experience to get my foot in the door for the next step.Automation Engineer: worked and learned alongside controls engineers and IT networking experts to bring data from machines to databases for various use cases. Learned some PLC programming (don’t really use it now), a lot about networking and various data transfer protocols, and a lot of data modeling/reporting. I also got the chance to use some of my own data that I collected to mess around and try to build machine learning predictive maintenance models. The models didn’t perform well (for reasons outside my own control), but I learned a lot. I got much better at both SQL and Python and general problem solving.Data/Analytics Engineer: with all the experience I gained from my previous role I was able to make my way into a junior data role by taking a pay cut and just speaking really passionately about data (which I genuinely am). Since then I’ve learned a shit ton about good programming principles/procedures, working in a platform like Databricks, and how to communicate with business partners about data projects.I’ve since been promoted in this role and absolutely love the work that I do. I find it engaging and I continue to learn every day. If you have additional questions let me know but I hope this helps a bit.",

I would say their program is pretty good for introduction to DE, I respect their contribution to the community. However, there are so many details or problems you need to consider when you are working a real-life project, and some of them are extremely critical for interviews. The lack of depth in their course design (because it's only three months) means you need to take the initiatives to explore way more than they provide to you within the curriculum, which also stands if you enrolled an expensive bootcamp. I was asked a system design question during an interview to design a real-time pipeline, so get prepared for a decent resume, different problems or challenges you might encounter during a project, lots of SQL questions, Python programming questions (maybe not Leetcode style), and system design questions. P.S, in my opinion, sometimes I tend to ignore some people's advice like getting a CS degree or get a job in the data field first. I am not saying they're wrong, but their suggestions are based on their background and experience. It stands 10 years or 5 years ago, but nowadays even CS new grads are also struggling to get a job, some people became a DE because there were so many opportunities.

Not to say I wouldn't work in the fields you mentioned purely for the cash money.>Additionally, I’d love to know more about how you entered the sector. Beyond the technical, how did you learn about the domain?There was a pretty big hiring spree for commodities platforms and there still are some quant style positions available in London. The ones I had interest from had pretty big ranges although typically needed Spark and something like web scraping or minimal experience in trading or commodities. I'm guessing hedge funds and certain traders are starting to build up their own bespoke data sets using data from the internet.",

One simple way to \"sync\" the two is to just make dev tables views pointing to prd tables.If you are doing streaming, Databricks has a few articles about that too.",

I generally suggest running jobs via service principals in prod. It shouldn’t really matter whether you execute your code as notebook or scripts, both are supported and can be run via service principals. Scripts are generally a cleaner way to do this but if you run notebooks in prod just make sure you check right permissions are in place etc",

However, it would be useful just to have point in time statistics on something at least for debugging. I feel like we have a large blind spot on even just table counts let alone column level stats. When something goes wrong, it's challenging right now to even answer what this table looked like yesterday. I'm thinking right now of an observer service and an anomaly service at least and have it extensible for different source types (Snowflake, S3) and table types (raw source, transformed source, transformed model). Checks happen on a cron-friendly cadence but at least once a day. Maybe even configurable indepdently by source, path, table or check type. Is it opt-in or opt-out?Would love to hear more about how you are thinking about it! I'm just starting to formulate my thoughts about it. And before any vendors come at me, don't bother, you're barking up the wrong tree :).Edit: I should amend this to say that we have a LOT of dbt tests and we are very good about defining a unique key and testing on it (not null and unique) so we generally know about fan-out problems but I'm more thinking the silent failures. Something is null all of sudden or data volume drops off a cliff or there is a significant skew in the most frequent values in recent data, amounts skyrocketing due to math errors, etc. Logic has changed somewhere so how can you be very certain that the downstreams aren't silently negatively affected.",

We use a hybrid approach - managed services like what you mentioned for the heavy lifting (proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving) but we build our own orchestration layer on top. Few things that have saved us headaches: Data format standardization is huge. We preprocess everything into a common schema before it hits our main pipeline. Saves tons of downstream issues. For retries, exponential backoff with jitter works well, but also build in circuit breakers for sites that go completely down. No point hammering a dead endpoint. Cost wise, managed services can get expensive fast if you're not careful about request volumes. We monitor spend daily and have hard limits set.One thing to watch with webhook delivery make sure you have proper queuing on your end. We learned that the hard way when a client's scraping job flooded our ingestion endpoints.Also consider the legal side. Some sites are getting more aggressive about scraping ToS enforcement. Worth having clear data usage agreements with your stakeholders.What kind of volumes are you looking at? That usually determines if managed makes sense vs rolling your own infrastructure.",

It helped because what would otherwise have been an individual topic only had a small trickle of records with occasional bursts -- not enough to justify running a separate streaming ingestion job for each, nor to handle the overhead of parquet+deltalake over individual row writes.So we bundled everything into one big stream with a wrapper around each event to indicate which type it was, which just helped with later processing.The advantage for us is we could run each downstream job on any schedule we wanted, all the data was there in the big ingestion table. Technically there is overhead with reading all the other data, but compared to reading directly off of kafka (or similar) it was still much faster to pull off lake storage.Another advantage was the sharing of overhead on the streaming size. Basically all the topics combined shared the same overhead or cluster oversizing, so while an individual 'topic' might burst to 10x traffic, since it only makes up 10% of the overall bandwidth, it would not shift performance demands too much. It kept usage reasonably predictable.Low latency use cases still ran off the original topics. The combined one was just for long term storage and batch processes.",

Then you avoid the overwrite and get tracking of adjustments that will support you if you ever want to make the case for fixing the problem at the source.

This is the Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Flink, Druid, NoSQL world. You would use these tools to complete projects such as real time data streaming, distributed computing, and moving petabytes of data around.Companies with a need to move massive amounts of data have use for this kind of data engineering: FAANG, Airbnb, Uber, and other companies that have serious needs to move petabytes of real time data and shit like that.The other side is BI and Analytics. This kind of data engineering can feature some code through use of APIs but nothing like the distributed computing Spark jobs and Kafka. Getting data for analytics is a lot more chill. Data doesn't have to be real time, maybe once a day or a week suffices. Stored procedures can reliably move large sets of data around. The skill set here is about analytics and SQL. No python, no system design, no fancy algorithm. It becomes more so a practice in how good you are at understanding the business, using that knowledge to analyze the data, and finally reporting on those connected dots with services like SSRS, Tableua, and Sigma, etc.Now, the HTML/CSS and Flask stuff is more like a back-end/full-stack Python engineering skill set. Throw in ReactJS for that front end your working and that's pretty much full-stack software development. I would try and figure out what you want to do first. Just remember: BI and Analytics data engineering is way different from the software engineering-esque data jobs.",

A webpage stored locally that can only display information isn’t useful, so technologies were developed to solve these issues, which increased complexity. Honestly, an interesting simile to your observation would be, why do we need C/C++ if we could do everything in Assembly, which is the simplest language. An analog would be, why need a drill press when you have a drill. The reason why complexity exists, is because we have more complex problems.The tools and frameworks developers use that are “complex” actually have streamlined a lot of issues for us. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to process text if no one made “Stream” packages, or how annoying frontend webdev would be if frameworks like Vue.js and React didn’t exist?Just because something is complex, doesn’t mean it’s bad, but again, it becomes less complex when you get experience.",

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.You would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a \"bare metal\" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?Mobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do \"bad things\", you cannot do \"bare metal\" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different \"operating systems\", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.You will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it. Raw SDL is fine if what you're doing is fairly simple, a few UI elements there, a sprite there, but once you get beyond a certain level of complexity you'll either be wrapping it in your own engine, starting to use a framework yourself, or you \"muscle through\" it and create an unholy abomination that's a mess to work with.",

        "body": "I’m seeing weird answer here. The reason why a simple hello world is so difficult to get going dates back to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.Enter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.Now as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.This is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text elementI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",

I've seen people with 5+ years of experience who see a function begin with checking whether the arguments are in a hashmap and not immediately realise that it's memoisation. At this point it doesn't matter how good you can program your own stuff, you can not trusted to modify other people's code without destroying something.",

        "body": "Despite the emphasis on computer code as something that does something in a computer, what it also fundamentally is an expression of human thought. (That's not as pretentious as it sounds. Pretty much any thing else expressive is, especially if it involves language, like a song or even this post.)When you look at someone else's code, you're looking at how they expressed their ideas in a form that can be executed on a computer. Different people will have different takes on that, even for the same problem. (That's one reason why one person's code may make immediate sense and someone else's doesn't - it can very much depend on whether you're thinking about the problem the same way they are or not.) So a key part of being able to read someone else's code is to approach it from a \"what were they thinking when they wrote this\" point of view. One of the first things you can do to help understand the code is identify what concepts they're expressing in the code - what the various players are, so to speak. The sooner you can grasp the bigger picture and what ideas are involved, the easier it will be once you get down into the details.One thing that will help you over time is having more and more exposure to different ideas. If you're looking at an HTTP server implementation, for example, it will make a lot more sense if you've seen one before, so you know what things are and how they interact. So a big part of being able to more readily understand code is having already been exposed to the concepts its trying to express, even if later it's expressed in a way you haven't seen before. You can know what the underlying ideas are.Unfortunately, this is where a lot of documentation comes up short. The individual calls makes sense once you have a broader view - the big picture - but the documentation often seems to start from the (unspoken) point of view that you already know all that. So you end up having to try to work out it's an elephant and not a tree or a snake.What will make reading code easier over time is:\\- Seeing (and understanding) enough code that can know the various idioms and, more importantly, what they *mean*. That is, what the developer was most likely trying to say when they wrote the code.\\- Gaining knowledge in the domains the code is a solution for, so you can know what things mean more readily and can more quickly get the lay of the land once you dive in.\\- Writing more code yourself. Discovering how *you* express ideas will give you critical insight into how *others* express ideas in code. Eventually, you'll get to a point where you'll be able to see code and go \"I know what that means\" because you've not only seen it before but written it yourself before.Hope that helps!\\[Note: Not all code is going to be so easily digested, even with experience. Some code is poorly written. Some software developers are insane. You can only work with what you're given. :) )",

Honestly you can get by for a very long time without knowing anything about trees or graphs, or Big-O notation - and I have yet to meet the person who actually *had* to implement quicksort or any other sorting algorithm from memory (and didn't just do it because it was a fun exercise).I think DSA is fun, and like everything else in programming it gives you a whole new perspective on how to think about data, and it helps you understand and implement well-known algorithms - but the idea that you MUST know how and why quicksort or red black trees work, that's just ridiculous.Like a carpenter doesn't have to be a wood scientist, a programmer doesn't have to be a computer scientist, because Computer Science isn't programming - it is the study of how computers can be programmed to perform computations. And vice versa - just because you can provide a mathematical proof that your sorting algorithm will perform in O(n log n) it doesn't mean that you can implement the feature that the customer asks for.",

I've got a masters degree in CS, have led teams and certainly don't think you need those fundamentals to be a developer (even a good one). But learning them will most definitely improve your quality as a developer and skill level. If you want to go down the technical path I recommend learning those fundamentals. Also to be clear - it's not about just learning specific algorithms. It's understanding data structures, complexities of algorithms and trade-offs. It's about understanding how to develop algorithms when you need them. I've seen a lot of developers claiming they are not interested in \"CS trivia\", dismissing value of fundamental CS knowledge. In my opinion that's a mistake.",

This is an unfortunate reality of today’s developer market. I am in the same boat as you and even went much stupider into enrolling into a software engineering university as well as a bootcamp and some self learning myself. I have some familiarity some projects but nothing fully transactional. The market itself makes me build my own SaaS instead of even thinking to try anything like internships and so on. I thought university will actually provide internships but it seems I am so far away from that that I can’t even believe it how ridiculous it is. It’s majority about networking and actual shipping products. I had in mind a bit of technical ability and then get into the project management leadership roles as I already have experience as a manager/leader…. I have no chance for anyone to invest in me as I’m not a code monkey and no one does anything these days because of the budget… It’s just pushes us into other jobs until we are able to find a team to fit ourselves into and then that belonging will be limited until this will again happen. That’s the cycle of a developer. So in conclusion yes get a job- you’ll learn less and invest more time but you will have something for the time being. Make sure the job you choose can actually be something you can always jump back to once developing ends until it starts back again. The dilo for a developer nowadays is worse than a dilo for a warehouse worker that is underpaid and overworked. This life… Enjoy",

Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic. I think the best thing you can do is write your question down now and come back to it in a few years, after you’ve taken more advanced courses. That goes back to item #1 on this list: trust your professors, they know a lot more than you do.",

You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.Kinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common. Trees are obviously very likely to involve recursive operations and trees come up all the time in real world data wherever data are organised hierarchically: DOM trees, parse trees, nested spatial info, organisational charts, I'm sure you can think of many more examples where data are naturally nested in a self-similar manner.Most of my code is not recursive, but I wouldn't be a competent programmer if I didn't know how to use recursion when it's the better choice.",

Not only that, RAM cache is also very critical for performance, and hash tables are nearly always inferior to simple arrays when it comes to hitting cache. For performance there is also the idea of branching - in simple terms: whether or not the CPU can guess correctly if an if-statement will be true or false. Due to that you want as little if-statements as possible in performance critical areas, and i think all practical implementations of hash-tables have if-statements.2. Hash tables usually dont have order. If i want sorted data and often return the smallest/biggest member or a rank related to size, Hash tables are useless. Even simple strings have meaning to their order. EDIT: i dont think you can actually achieve order in hash-tables without a complementary list/array.3. You may need/want to use stack memory instead of heap memory and hash tables are hard and inefficient to implement using only stack memory.4. hash-tables pre-allocate chunks of memory before its ever used. if you want to save on memory you may want a different ADT.With that being said, when you mostly care about average case big O notations, hash-tables are pretty amazing.

The first one would be to create a program that opened a window with the text \"Hello, World\", and then change that to \"playing music\" - the second would be opening a file, and not really doing anything with it, just opening it without crashing. The third would then be to play that file as a music-file - and since you probabaly don't know how to program that, but others have built libraries for it, you search for \"C++ Windows play mp3 file\" or something like that, and get some example code.You spend a lot of time getting that example code to work in your project, and then you've got your \"Music Player version 0.01\"Next step is then to maybe let the player display some info about the music being played - adding play, pause, stop, rewind buttons - adding a seekbar etc.Every tiny step makes the player better and better - and because it is tiny steps, you can search for specific help on \"how to create play/pause toggle-button\" rather than very generic \"how to create music player\". There's of course more to it, but that is basically the way most of us work - start with the smallest thing possible, and everytime it works, we add another feature. One step at a time.",

Let’s say you use SDL for audio, so you create a CLI app that plays a simple wave file.Then you extend to load another media type (Orbis, MP3,…). Then you add other media types.In parallel to this, you build a GUI app. Display text, then a menu, then a wave. Then you put everything together. That’s your version 0. You iterate from there. If you want to do things properly, you can then spend time properly architecturing your application to make it more maintainable, extendable.

So I need to be able to queue up some files and then play them in the queue order.3. Figure out what I'm going to have to learn how to use to accomplish that goal. So I'm at the very least going to need to learn to build the window, work with the GTK ListModel, and find a library that will play sound and hopefully handle all of the threading issues gracefully. SDL is a pretty good choice for a cross-platform sound playing library even though it's intended for games.4. Lay out the project directory as well as bolt together all of the libraries I need, and for a windowed application, make some kind of \"Hello, world!\" window.5. Do the rest of the work. I would likely consider that I'm going to need a SongPlayer class and a Playlist class and code those things up accordingly, then from there's it's wiring up button callbacks and updating the state of the window.",

You could decide not to of course, but then your API is not RESTful but instead simply an API communicating via HTTP.There are some HTTP communication protocols, like GraphQL, that (almost) always return a 200 response and the error in the body. Unless you are specifically using one of these protocols I would use the correct HTTP verbs wherever possible. Conforming to industry standards just makes everything easier. For example, many JS network libs (like Axios) understand that a HTTP status code of 400 is an error response and will throw an error on the client. This makes error handling client side a lot easier, as you can implement try/catch blocks.",

        "body": "I am of the camp that outside the most common status codes, no, you should not use most of the status codes that exist, because most of them have niche semantics that won't be applicable to you or are used in specific subprotocols that ride on top of HTTP like WebDAV, or HTTP extensions. Perhaps a 200 for an error is not OK, but I would prefer an API with consistent error responses to one that abuses 20 different HTTP statuses all slightly incorrectly. Same thing with HTTP verbs.Most HTTP status codes are designed to describe outcomes related to the transport itself rather than the business logic that is behind it, and as such, HTTP status codes should be used to describe issues that occur prior to any form of processing or side effect and past that you should fall back to a very small subset of statuses to describe the outcome. That is what a body is for.. The problem with this tends to be when people have to shoehorn complex behaviour into a single endpoint due to reasons outside their control, and they start abusing other HTTP status codes (especially WebDAV codes) to try and communicate their intent for things like partial success, or precondition failure, or side effects. They then do not realise half the HTTP status codes have strict and specific semantics about things like headers that should be included with them, and they break the rules of the spec by using them, which is far worse than just not using them at all. HTTP was not originally designed for requesting that Amazon sends you a new bag of cat food, it was designed for asking Amazon to show you a webpage about cat food.There is then confusion on what describes a client versus a server error. Does a 400 purely specify that a request looks okay, or does it imply that the actual data it represents is meaningful in terms of the current system state and data that is stored? Do you expect a server to start processing your request prior to giving a 400 back? Does bad request purely describe the request itself or the implication of that request? Do you consider a 500 to mean something went wrong during processing or just that your server is fucked? Once you get into the rabbithole of trying to work out exactly when each code is valid, you realise the system you are integrating with made a totally different decision on how to organise this and interpret it differently.The other issue is that some HTTP libraries made the somewhat braindead decision to throw exceptions when you get certain status codes, and this then makes integration more difficult. Really what you are often communicating is semantically tied to your own system, and if that is the case, using the body to communicate that rather than the status code can be more sensible.Even from a monitoring perspective, anything significant will be relying on application metrics rather than metrics from load balancers to determine system health. Load balancer metrics for status codes just give a rough idea of how much stuff is working versus not working.TLDR: 400, 401, 403, 404, 2xx, 500, 503 are OK. Use those as you will. Anything more complicated that is related to business logic should just be in a 200 or 500 and detail the issue in the body. Abusing other codes like 422, 423, 507 just because they \"sound like\" what you want is far worse than just using vague codes. If you are giving me a 479 Shits Fucked Yo designed to be used with WebFTP v2.718281828459045 from 1943, or a 486 Its Tuesday that Twitter used once, then I have a problem. Using 200 for errors might be controversial but if it is easier to do that and provide consistent responses in the body across your systems, then go for it. Whether you are checking a status code inside or outside a body, most programming languages use the same constructs to inspect it. If using a 3 digit number at the start of a response is what people think defines usability, then they are just gatekeeping unless there is an actual technical requirement for it.",

I’ve been in a similar boat, where the hands-on stuff takes priority, but then you start hitting roadblocks in interviews or realizing there are gaps in your understanding of core concepts.First off, don’t beat yourself up too much. You’ve already got a solid understanding of how to get things done in real-world scenarios, which is a huge plus. The next step is just filling in those gaps in theory and fundamentals.One option could be looking into free or low-cost online resources. There are a ton of high-quality materials out there. Sites like Coursera, edX, or freeCodeCamp offer courses that dive into algorithms, data structures, and other core topics. If you're feeling motivated enough to try something more structured, CS50 from Harvard is an amazing free intro to computer science.Another suggestion is tackling coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. They’ll help you get comfortable with algorithmic thinking and test your understanding of fundamental concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and graph theory. It can be tough at first, but it’s a great way to get that theory-practice balance.As for motivation, maybe set up a study routine that combines theory with practical application—like, for example, learn a concept in theory, then solve problems related to it. It’ll help you connect the dots and see the real-world value of what you're learning.In terms of classes, I’d say if you're going to invest in them, a well-structured, affordable course from places like Udemy or Pluralsight might give you more value for your money.

Im curious about what interviews look like now that theres a bigger focus on ai…The best advice I can give is if your understanding of java for example is not great take a course to become an expert on it and that will probably help with your confidence. No one is good at reading documentation. For that you just have to force yourself to read it line by line and then summarise each paragraph to yourself to help cement the information in that paragraph. I especially struggle with pushing myself to learn more, but because I’m aware of it, I can now push myself to work on correcting it. It sounds like you probably know what your weaknesses are, your best way to fix it is to find a way to build your confidence in those skills. You very likely know more than you realise and just need to find a way to change your mindset. It’s pretty common to struggle with this but if you’re looking to specialise in something focus on what you enjoy and just branch out from there. Good luck! Hopefully this helps at least a little bit.",

If somebody asks me to do something don't know anything about I just tell them \"hey, I don't have experience on that but I'd be super keen to learn.\"Thats a very respected response, because it means that you care enough about the end result to not make more work for other people. A surprisingly uncommon attitude.To be honest I think you're suffering a little from imposter syndrome.

On another note: if you are overwhelmed when learning or digging deep: I often feel, that I should not invest that much time in that problem; that I should take a short cut to an easy way out.If you have similar experiences: make learning/understanding/contemplating your explicit goal for a set amount of time. Instead of finishing the project in 2h try to understand the aspect of the framework you are using for 3h and then finish the project in another 2h.

On top of that, we didn’t have AI tools back then to help explain concepts step-by-step like we do now.Honestly, a lot of the time I felt lost, especially since many professors kind of checked out or weren’t available. StackOverflow became my lifeline. There were so many moments when I was stuck and had no one to ask, so I had to figure things out on my own.About AI — I think it’s important to understand that AI doesn’t just solve the problem for you or give you the perfect answer every time. Instead, it helps guide you toward the solution, giving you hints or a direction to think in. At the end of the day, it’s still you who needs to understand the problem, connect the dots, and come up with the real answer.That guidance is incredibly valuable, especially when you feel overwhelmed or stuck. But relying solely on AI without building your own understanding won’t get you far. I think being aware of that balance — using AI as a tool, but still doing the hard thinking yourself — is what makes a real difference.So, hang in there. The fact that you’re reflecting on this and want to improve means you’re already on the right path. We all had shaky starts, but what matters is how we keep moving forward. You’ve got this!",

If you don’t work in an environment where you design the code the architecture and so on those are useless skills as long as you are paid to ship products and the how doesn’t really matter in most cases as much as the end product. In regards to your own abilities yes some jobs are really really bad as they will not develop good skills but force you to compromise on it. My advise will be to focus on that back end structure and architecture that you said you are loving and have smal windows where you either ask chat got to explain to you things like you were a beginner and they are your pair programming partner and so on or you find communities of people that share the same interest. For example you could start mentoring junior developers and have them contribute to your own back end small to medium and later expert api designs while implementing all the testing strategies and so on. It doesn’t matter if that direction is provided by chat got as long as you explain that to someone else as it’s coming from you as the one you explain to will struggle to understand or follow and you need to constantly repeat yourself hence learning the subject as you teach it. Pair programming is very good and the practice of small iterative steps while using git hub and commits push and pull requests with branching is an amazing collaborative tool to provide knowledge for yourself and for the mentored pupil. This will make both your GitHub’s active and it shows consistency. Setup the backend repo make a snap quick dummy - trace the steps and then delete it and provide the same from scratch to your newbie taking it slow explaining everything like he has no clue - which he won’t anyway - forcing you to explain your code differently even though you have an idea what it means. Encourage them to ask questions and focus on interacting instead of building. Follow the driver navigator pattern and make sure you stay within the roles themselves both the beginner and you and then switch after either functions being made or later features depending on the project itself. There is more to it on the aspect of self development here but I won’t get into that either as I’m writing too mi ha but find an actual person that works on backend and ask for being mentored by them as well. This will provide you with both as a mentee and mentor experience and will help you develop your skills in no time compared to what you doing. Focus on finding solutions together other than shipping a solution. Enjoy",

If you want the \"thorough\" treatment of C, then King's C Programming: A Modern Approach is better.Beej's Guide to C is OK-ish, but I don't think it's as good as his Guide to Network Programming. I would recommend a different book if you are a beginner to C. Beej's Guide is useful if you want to see explanations of new C features like #embed or #include , but a major weaknesses for new learners are that there are no \"student exercises\". I suppose you could invent some on your own, but it's a sign of a good book that good, well-thought-out exercises are given at each stage that help you \"level up\" at each chapter, to help you slowly build up your \"rpgramming muscles\" as it were. Both K&R's book and King's book do that very effectively. In fact for the classic K&R book there is also a separate book called The C Answer Book where solutions are given. But in order to get the most out of such exercises, you should first try your own solutions yourself before reading another answer.Also, I noticed you have no book which specifically mentions assembly language. If you want to learn low level, then you need at least a passing familiarity with Assembly, in my opinion, e.g. x86, x86\\_64, ARM, or all of them. If you learn one architecture, then learning another is not as hard.",

What worked for me: learn a programming language. Preferably Go or Python. Learn Linux, use it as your daily driver. Learn how to use the terminal. Learn everything you can about installing and maintaining a Linux system. RHCSA is good, but not needed. Learn Docker and Kubernetes. Learn a cloud service like AWS or Azure. Most importantly, always be ready to learn. I did all that and applied to a DevOps/Sys Admin role. The company I applied to also needed intern product developer role. I volunteered for that. Did a 6 month internship. Pretty weird to be an intern as a 34 year old, but I’d like to think I killed it there. They made me a permanent employee on June 1st and I’m loving it. I suppose being a bit older than a regular intern motivated me to put my best foot forward. I volunteered to do things no one else wanted to. Learned a lot in the process. Hope things work out for you.",

I know that there are a lot of ways to do the same stuff. If you saw someone did something differently - it doesn't mean that you are wrong. It just means that you just discovered one more way to do the same stuff.Be proud to say \"I don't know\". Don't try to hide it. If you get into a place where people shame you for that phrase - they are stupid and cowards. Not knowing something is just a first step into knowing it. Without this step - you will never learn anything.I worked at some companies where the code base is so terrible that even with my bad experience I was shocked by its quality. And the people there were so proud of themselves.After that I started to realize that perfect code exists only in examples. If the project is live and constantly changing - the chances that it will become a monster are almost 99%.It doesn't mean that you should not care about your code. It means that at any point of your career what you know is enough. Just keep learning from your mistakes. And keep going.Perfectionism killed more projects than bad code.

But, that doesn't help you at allAlso, a programming language is a tool you need but the thought process is the factor that helps you to figure out how to build something.

Very close to a recipe in a cookbook, but structured so even the \"stupidest\" reader would be able to follow.I honestly don't get why so many seem to struggle with it - maybe it is because they are required to use LaTeX, where pseudocode is literally a language with very specific syntactical rules, and it is truly a pain to format anything in it ... Because otherwise pseudocode is just intended to ignore syntax rules, specific keywords and built in library functions - just write what the program should do!The few times I've met students that claimed they didn't understand pseudocode, it wasn't because they didn't understand pseudocode, it was because they didn't understand the algorithm or the program they were supposed to write. At least not on any level of abstraction above the actual code (which was most likely written by someone else, copied from the web, or generated by AI).Maybe students should try to write pseucocode for each other, and implement solutions that someone else wrote the pseudocode for ... And maybe teachers should stop requiring students to \"code\" in LaTeX pseudocode-languages!",

Your goal is to convey the gist of your idea.Here is legitimate pseudocode:```pythonRepeat for numbers from 1 to 100: If the number divides evenly by 15: Print \"FizzBuzz\" Else if the number divides evenly by 3: Print \"Fizz\" Else if the number divides evenly by 5: Print \"Buzz\" Otherwise: Print the number itselfEnd of loop```Notice how it's very easy to read?And it's mostly just EnglishBut it's still the algorithm.Here's another version, equally easy to read, but this time recursive... with some comments```pythonDefine a function that takes a number (i): If i > 100: Stop # Base case: stop when we've printed up to 100 If i divisible by 15: Print \"FizzBuzz\" # Multiple of both 3 and 5 Else if i divisible by 3: Print \"Fizz\" # Multiple of 3 only Else if i divisible by 5: Print \"Buzz\" # Multiple of 5 only Else: Print i # Not a multiple of 3 or 5 Call the function with i + 1 # Continue to the next number```See? Still readable. It even has comments!And here, here's one with emojis, still perfectly good pseudocode```pythonDefine fizzbuzz(i): If 15 perfectly divides i then return :beer_mug::honeybee: Else if 3 perfectly divides i then return :beer_mug: Else if 5 perfectly divides i then return :honeybee: Else return iDefine apply_fizzbuzz(numbers): Return map fizzbuzz over numbersCall apply_fizzbuzz on range 1 to 100Print each result```So yeah.. just do your own thing!",

What matters as a software developer is your ability to creatively problem-solve using the fundamentals of computer science to tackle complex tasks. Being good at this will make you successful in all parts of SWE.If you want a decent-paying job as a software developer, here is your roadmap:1. Go to school for a CS degree2. Get an internship during your studies3. Between school, work, etc, practice building large, complex, full-stack projects to showcase on your resume4. By the time you graduate, you will probably spend several months to a year competing for entry-level jobsJumping in to SWE expecting your life to quickly improve is a mistake. You missed the boat by around 10+ years.",

Nursing is absolutely recession proof. People always get sick, and there's a massive shortage of nurses. Plus at 48, you'd have a solid 20+ year career ahead of you.But since you asked about tech longevity... AI/ML, cybersecurity, and mobile development aren't going anywhere. Web development is evolving but still fundamental. The thing is, tech moves fast and you gotta keep learning constantly. At Metana we see people in their 40s and 50s successfully transition into development, but it takes real commitment to stay current.Here's what I'd consider in your shoes. What actually interests you more? Do you want to help people directly through healthcare, or do you get excited about building things digitally? Both can be financially rewarding but they're completely different day to day experiences.Also, have you thought about healthcare tech? There's tons of opportunity there, especially for people who understand both sides. But honestly, if you're leaning toward nursing for the stability and recession-proofing, that's totally valid reasoning.The rental income gives you flexibility to take either path without desperation, which is huge. Most people don't have that luxury when making career pivots.",

I’d be happy with government or organizations that are focused on improving people’s lives. I hope I’m on the right path, just started learning web development on code academy as a starting point. So far enjoying it and absorbing it with my pace which is the best part about online learning.I hope you find what you’re looking for. I’m turning 41 this year. My attitude is it’s never too late. Because through learning, you’ll find yourself and your place along the way even if it doesn’t end up being what you initially intended to go towards, kinda like post secondary.

You still have to actually learn how to program and you should learn it on SOMETHING, once you understand the concepts and get a flow for making things it becomes easier to pick up another language. I wouldn't leave yourself not understanding async for example, it is used almost everywhere, even if you aren't writing it, it will be built into the libraries you are using. The best way to learn is to do, so pick a language and try to write something with a thread or two just to see how it is done and run the thought exercise for managing the sync and flow of everything. I think the advice is true, when you get your job you will be working in the tech stack the company has and most of the difficulty will be figuring out the companies code base, so while you might be an expert in one language they may be using another. However, this does not mean that it doesn't make your life easier to know one language and just learn the ins and outs of the other language vs trying to figure out say async concepts while figuring out he language, it is much better to pick up a language and read what kind of async stuff is in the language while understanding the concepts and challenges ahead of time. It is much better to help you evaluate the code base as well if you have a good understanding of what 'good' can look like. Another interpretation of it might really be that you can't learn everything a computer can do now a days, it is essentially infinite as it continuously expands day bay day. But again, do not take this as don't bother mastering what you are working on, or, i don't get this topic and am free to moving on. If you move on make it for a good reason, you won't ever use it perhaps or hate it so much you would refuse a job working with it etc.",

You already understand user problems and how systems break, which is half the battle.Between JavaScript and C#, honestly both are solid choices but I'd lean toward JavaScript for someone in your position becuase JavaScript is everywhere. Frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile apps, even desktop apps. More versatility means more job opportunities. The learning curve can be a bit weird at first but once it clicks, you're golden. C# is great too, especially if you're thinking enterprise development or want something more structured. Microsoft ecosystem is huge and pays well.At Metana we see a lot of career changers and the ones who succeed fastest are usually those with some kind of customer facing or problem solving background. They just \"get\" what users need in a way that pure CS grads sometimes dont.My advice? Pick JavaScript, build a few projects that solve real problems you've seen in help desk work, and apply for roles that value that crossover like developer advocate positions, technical support engineering, or even full stack roles at smaller companies.Either way you choose though, you're already ahead of most beginners because you understand the business side of tech. Don't underestimate that advantage :)",

It will teach you the most fundamental of all programming languages, C, but almost more importantly: You will understand every other language afterwards more easily, especially a lot of design decisions in C++, Java, Rust and many more.It has little exercises and some larger programming projects in it to directly apply the stuff you read about.

There are also some great sites like CodeCademy that have guided practice / learning sessions - these would probably be more than enough to teach you the fundamental terms you'll want to familiiarize yourself with.More than anything, it is \\*totally\\* normal to feel lost. Just remember that you do not need to understand all of a certain language or anything (nobody does!), and that you can go quite far with the fundamental building blocks of most programming (like variables, functions, loops, and conditionals). Although there tends to be \"better\" ways to do things and \"worse\" ways to do things, there are TONS of solutions to the same problem in programming, perhaps more so than many other fields. Just to clarify - GitHub is basically a platform for storing and sharing code projects, especially when multiple people are working together. It's more of a tool for managing and collaborating on code rather than a place to learn programming itself. That's probably why you felt so lost there!In any case, try to have fun as you learn!",

If you make a change where you later find out something broke, you can always revert back to the commit where you know everything worked.Of course there is still lots of room for improvement here with proper branching strategies. But to start off, this is better than nothing.**Tests:**In your case, I would really suggest writing integration or end to end tests. Ignore unit tests completely.All you want to know is that broadly speaking, your feature set works as intended. Caring about every single unit of code is not where you're at.[Test bahavior, not implementation details](https://codeling.dev/blog/testing-behavior-or-implementation/) which will tell you immediately if any of your features break and makes refactoring code much less risky and certainly less of a pain in the a$$.**Where to start:**Since you're really concerned about existing working features breaking when you change something, I would really suggest writing a few tests for the most important features.Maybe start working in version control when you feel you're up to it,...but at least start with a few end to end or integration tests which focus on behavior. It's easier than you think,....and actually quite fun,...and makes you feel safe making changes or new features.",

I remember feeling exactly like this when I was starting out and honestly, even now running Metana and helping train developers, I still see this pattern with almost every single student who transitions into their first dev role.Here's the thing that might help reframe this. You upgraded Node containers, used new JS features, AND you sought help when you hit a roadblock. That's actually really solid problem-solving. Yeah, you could have done the cloud builder upgrade yourself, but how were you supposed to know that without... well, being told exactly what happened?Your tech lead isn't frustrated with you, they're teaching you. There's a huge difference. If they thought you were doing poorly, trust me, you'd know it. The fact that they're giving you your own features to plan means they see potential.At Metana, I always tell our bootcamp grads that the first 6-12 months are basically extended learning with a paycheck. You're not supposed to know everything yet. The goal is to learn fast and not make the same mistake twice.One thing that really helped me early on was keeping a \"learning log\". Just a simple doc where I'd write down these exact situations. What I did, what I learned, how I'd handle it next time. Looking back at it after a few months was eye-opening because I could see how much I'd actually grown.Also, 5 months in and you're already handling complex features and supporting QA? That's actually ahead of the curve. Most devs I know were still figuring out the codebase at that point.The imposter syndrome is real but it gets better as you build up more of these learning experiences. Just don't let it paralyze you from taking on those new features they want you to plan.",

My technical skill set is outdated at this point and that combined with being old now makes me feel like an unlikely candidate for a technical role, but I still have my industry experience and my passion (hopefully) so I'm wondering if I could be a project manager or somesuch, has something like that crossed your mind?",

That's actually not old at all in tech, and honestly some of the sharpest people I know didn't really hit their stride until their 40s or later.Your IT support background is actually gold. Most college grads and junior devs have zero real world troubleshooting experience, but you've got 4 years of it. That's huge when things break in production.About the ADHD thing, look, it can be challenging but it can also be a superpower once you find your groove. The hyperfocus aspect is incredible for debugging or diving deep into problems that would frustrate other people.Regarding web dev vs cloud/cyber? honestly with your AZ-900 already done, you've got momentum there. Don't underestimate that achievement. The fact that you passed shows you can learn new tech. At Metana we've had plenty of career changers in their 40s and 50s. What I notice is they often outperform younger students because they have better work discipline and actually know what they want from their career.My take? Pick one path and commit for 6 months. Based on what you've shared, cloud seems like the natural next step. Go for AZ-104 next, build some projects, document everything you do. The networking and scripting stuff will come as you practice.You're not behind. You're just getting started on the next chapter :)",

If it's about \"need,\" the answer is \"not much,\" because there's such a wide range of specializations needing different things. Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.For example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.As you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to \"just know\" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they \"need\" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.This especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.So, overall, I think the answer is \"learn *some* things well.\" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library. Looking things up on the job is fine, but learn from those resources, don't just drop them and move on as soon as you've found an answer.",

These days with AI and the documentation out there, it's pretty easy to look things up and figure out solutions. Most of what you do is take a problem and break it down into what you need to do, then research how to do it. This is a process.Writing the code itself (ignoring AI writing the code for you or just vibe coding) is a bit of that process and a bit of actual knowledge of the methods, properties and syntax required. This just comes with time. At first you will be constantly looking things up, but eventually it will start to sink in. Im personally glad I learned most of what I know before AI because now it is hard to do anything without it since it is just so much faster to get a quick answer. Even then it is super important to understand what the AI is telling you to do and why.",

Gaming is a huge industry and there are loads of jobs in it so you shouldn't think of making mods for Minecraft as something that diverts from becoming a programmer in the future. In fact I'd argue that it is a really good place to start because you are interested in the game, so you will be very invested in learning. I learned HTML at around your age because I wanted to make fan sites for bands I was into. Whatever it is that gets you interested in learning is important. And employers are still going to see coding skill in making mods for games, so don't worry too much that it is a distraction, or diversion from your goal of becoming a programmer.",

The difference is that with C#, you have to compile your code before running it, but that's true of many other languages too.The .NET framework is basically just the standard library for C#. So being \"dependent on the .NET framework\" is like being \"dependent on Chrome to provide the browser DOM APIs\". The same dependency exists in both cases, it's just that you don't really notice it in the second case because the browser came pre-installed on your computer, or you installed it before you started thinking about programming.And in both cases, the framework that you're using is open source, so you're not really being \"sold\" anything. It's true that if you invest time into learning a language and ecosystem, that investment \"locks you in\" to that ecosystem, but that's true of literally anything you could learn.",

But there's nothing preventing you from writing C# in any text-based editor, it's just harder than using an IDE or at least a code editor but the same is true for JS.

It's easier to write various projects in it, JS above else is for webpages and even though it tries to be useful in other places it's not particularly good in it.

It also really depends on how much you care about the C++ aspect by itself.",

If you’re just starting out, I’d recommend following his YouTube playlists in the order he’s arranged them - he usually builds up from basics to advanced topics, so it’s a good flow for learning concepts step by step.Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you can use his TUF website to focus on specific topics or practice questions. The site is great for targeted revision and for brushing up on theory before tackling coding problems. Some people like to watch the theory video for a topic, then immediately try related questions from the site—that’s a solid approach too.So, in short: - If you want a structured path, follow the YouTube playlist order- If you want to focus on certain topics or practice, use the TUF website to pick and choose. Good luck!",

More practically: imagine that these questions aren't created in code as part of an exercise/test but are simply read from a database. and another tool is used to insert the questions into the database. So as a programmer you have no idea how many questions there are or how to name them.It makes a lot more sense to simply throw them into a list (the list of questions). In your case because you run into exercises and example code, often people want to show you things you'll encounter in later life but run into the problem that doing the setup for these sorts of systems would distract you from the thing they are trying to teach. So they compromise.Personally I would find it better to use a function that returns the questions (in your case). the function will return a list of questions and you can add in comments / naming of the function that it represents a lookup from file or database. that way you can practice working with abstractions / accepting data comes from another location (without needing to know exactly how it is put together)",

Second goal is to make it nicer to read, which means separating stuff out into functions, and if it's really its own monster, taking up half the main file, to a module it goes, purely for ease of use. I almost never set out with an idea how how many or what types of modules will need, I just come to points in the process where I'm like, damn that's ugly, or I realize that I'm re-using stuff, or this function is huge, let's throw it in a new file.Of course if you find yourself creating something where it's extremely obvious that you'll be using it all over, then sure, go ahead and proactively write it as a module from the get go and build it up as you go.",

Just endless pain and headaches and frustration. But until you experience some of that pain, none of the strategies to solve it really make that much sense. And when you're starting out working on smaller projects, often a lot of code organization is kind of optional anyways because you're not dealing with enough complexity for it to really matter.So, like, sure, read about it. Think about it. But understand that what will make it click is getting your hands dirty in the guts of big, complex codebases.This is the kind of thing that, although there are principles that can be applied, really needs experience and developing some *intuition* for the problem in order to be able to do well at it. Which is a *good* thing - it is the skills that are hard to develop except through long practice that makes programmers employable!",

        "body": "I think the easiest way to think about this is to think about what functions are actually meant to do. A function is a set of code that performs a specific task, and can be reused repeatedly. For example, thinking of a simple calculator application that we want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. When we think about specific tasks that can be made into functions, it sounds like we will need a function for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as those are all specific tasks that we want to perform repeatedly. Of course, identifying functions gets more complicated for larger projects, but you don't need to know all the functions you could possibly need ahead of time. Modularization isn't something that happens completely up-front before you program anything, it's something that you will do throughout the programming process. For me what works is outlining functions I know I need at the beginning, then starting to write my program and looking out for sections of code that are reused multiple times. When I realize it is something that is going to be reused, I move it to a function. Basically, keep an eye out for things that your program will be doing a lot of. Any time you are seeing the same logic repeated, or have something that performs a specific task, those are good things to consider putting into functions. Don't worry if you can't identify everything in advance or feel like it's a struggle at first. That's part of the learning process and I promise, it gets easier the more you do it!",

In my opinion it’s similar in this way to object oriented design. I use a limited version of both in my personal projects and when I’m working on small teams.For modularizing, you generally start with one file, and then at some point you break it into multiple files just as a basic organizing step. And yes you often make classes to encapsulate natural units, like a matrix class, a networking class, a class for the application overall.But once you start going crazy with lots and lots of classes, and complex class hierarchies, you make it harder to make those fundamental pivots.As a simple concrete example, an oop book might tell you a personnel management app should have an Employee class and from that derive classes for various types of employees, probably using intermediate classes, like a Manager class, from which you derive UnitManager and SeniorExec, all with their own classes. This might work out well in certain cases, if you’re lucky. But in my experience, just make the one Employee class and give it a “type” member. See how far that gets you before making a tree of classes, each probably in their own code file. And the same idea goes for overall modularization.I have a saying: Don’t divide and conquer yourself.",

We don't know what is going to change, but we know that change is inevitable. Maybe an API you depend on gets a breaking change, maybe you want to drastically change the way you display stuff to users, maybe you discover a major security flaw with how you're handling data etc etc...The way we prepare for that is not by thinking about every possible scenario and making preparations, but instead by building systems that are flexible to change. One way you could achieve that is by following the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).1. Limit your modules to only one responsibility. ([example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON))2. Write your modules to be open to extension, but closed to modification. ([example](https://alexnault.dev/open-closed-principle-in-functional-typescript))3. Any substitute modules you write should not break the program. ([example: a square data object is not a valid substitute for a rectangle data object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle#Violation))4. Keep code decoupled from other code it does not need. The math module does not need to know about drawing boxes on the DOM.5. Depend on interfaces rather than specific implementations.

Stop trying to memorize syntax. Seriouslyy. Even experienced devs look stuff up constantly. Focus on understanding the WHY behind data structures instead of memorizing how to implement them perfectly.2. Try the 'explain it to a rubber duck\" method. Before you code, explain out loud what you're trying to build and why. 3. Build the same data structure multiple times but solve different problems with it. Don't just implement a stack. Use it to check balanced parentheses, then use it for undo functionality etcc. This builds real understanding.Also, data structures in Java can be tricky because there's so much syntax to remember. Focus on understanding the concepts first, then worry about perfect implementation later.You're not behind. You're exactly where you should be in the learning process :)",

All developers forget the little bits from time to time, and it sucks because the code won't run without them, but it's just how it works. Our brains are not computers, so speaking computer languages, especially like Java, doesn't come naturally. When you were learning English, you didn't say everything correctly all the time either, and you still don't, but obviously you know English, and you can communicate your point well enough that everyone here, native English speaker or not, understands you. It's the same for Java, or any other coding language. You'll always be looking up this syntax or that function. Eventually, the things you're learning now will become second nature when you've used them in 50 different programs or functions. But by then, you'll be looking up other things you just can't remember the exact way to do. Don't stress about this part.But if, even after looking it up and getting the code to compile and do what you want it to do, you're not proud of yourself, then you might want to consider whether this is the right career for you. Because honestly, I will spend 60+ hours on a bug sometimes, and I have literally thrown a party (a happy hour with coworkers) when I got to a different error message I hadn't seen before. The bug wasn't fixed, but I had made some kind of progress, because now I was executing a different part of the code, and that was worth celebrating. If you don't want to party when the code works right (or at least more right), then you are either taking it all too seriously, or you might not have the right temperament for Software Engineering.Good luck!!",

Sometimes I use AI tools as a support when I'm trying to digest longer or more technical docs, using ChatDOC and ask it create a quick mind map from a doc - like breaking down a library’s structure or understanding how different parts connect, just so I don’t feel so lost when jumping back into code.But tools like this are just tools. They help you get your bearings, but they shouldn’t replace reading the source docs when it matters. So if reading docs feels boring, you can try to use tools to support your learning, break things into smaller chunks, build while you read, and permit yourself to skim when you need to. Just don’t skip the reading entirely, there’s a lot of value in it once your brain has some hands-on context to tie it to.",

I myself fall into the category of wanting to know how I will do things ahead of time.But, let's just go through some of your questions.**What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?**Try not to worry about the time frame. The course is set up for ten weeks, but this is a Harvard course and as a college course, it's pretty aggressive to finish so quickly. I would budget twice the time, maybe twenty weeks which is about 5 months, but take all the time you need. You don't have to race to the answer. You may feel like you have to be efficient, but expect to be slow, and don't pressure yourself to move faster because you'll likely skip information you need by trying to \"keep up\".**How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?**You've only given yourself 5 weeks. You are unlikely to finish unless you are either smart or cheat (you may think using ChatGPT is not cheating, but it is). The class already takes ten weeks for Harvard students, and you want to do it in half the time. Spending lots of hours, esp. on academic topics, is not always productive. There's this joke that goes \"if it takes 9 months for a woman to have a baby, then it should take 9 women 1 month each to have a baby\" which means that you can't speed up certain things. I mean, if you can spend that time and not go brain dead, then good for you. Give it a try. But most people find it hard to focus for more than about 3 hours a day. If you try for more, you'll need a break, and you'll have to be making some progress during that time.You might get through the C coding part if you happen to be quick (so 5 weeks).**How does submission of problem sets and projects work?**I think you need to read this and figure it out. It is a bit elaborate involving using Github and setting that up. Harvard doesn't want to be in business of managing user accounts. There are instructions on how to do this. I would say, outside of the actual programming itself, it's this part that's kind of annoying. You just have to follow the steps carefully, that's all. I would probably suggest using their version of Visual Studio Code (assuming they still use it).**Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?**You'll be instructed how to do this. This is the kind of question that suggest apprehension on your part. Read it, dig in, and figure it out. It's a useful skill to be able to work through problems.**Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!**The problem sets (which are the programming assignments) are challenging. I've taught intro programming and I would likely not give that level of difficulty to a class. In particular, CS50x uses more math than the projects I used to assign. Also, some projects are considered notoriously challenging. One is called Tideman. Usually, they have an easier version of the project and a harder one. You might opt to do the easier one.One reason Tideman is challenging is the length of the description of what to do. Beyond that, it's hard to visualize the arrays to place the data. If C were object-oriented, it might be easier to understand (though still not easy).Expect it to be challenging. Don't worry if you don't complete the course in a month. You're expecting a lot, maybe too much. Any progress would be considered good. Try not to be disappointed if you only get through, say, 3 weeks of the course in the time allotted. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed.Anyway, good luck. Hope you get done as much as you plan, but even if you don't you took some initiative which is a positive attitude.",

Focus on making sure that what you cover in x time, you fully understand and can demonstrably use (the problem sets will test this).I would take notes through using comments in your code. When you come back some time later to your code, comments really get you up to speed quickly. I would advise a good ol' fashioned notepad and pencil to help you with the problem sets.

Being too careless sucks, being too careful sucks. Really good advice, specially because it might pass as \"obvious\" for some people.Other than that, a good guiding comment on how to tackle CS50. I did most of the course's problems (Didn't make the final one, so no certificate to show) and even though I already had some experience with C(just as a student, I don't have any professional experience), Tideman gave me a few hours of thinking and stressing over. The course is indeed challenging and it brushes over some of topics that will require more studying if you want a better understanding, such as data structures and algorithms, how memory works and so on.Not OP, but thank you for the comment and willingness to share your experience in depth.",

But that was only because they knew how to do Google searches (I'm talking about those who took this approach before ChatGPT was a thing) and learned just enough to make progress. That kind of person assumes that this is the approach that works for everyone. They like the approach that allows them to work on a problem and get to a solution with the minimum amount of theoretical work. But it doesn't work for everyone. Some need more guidance on how to think before they dive into doing a project. Also, picking a good project that is at the right level is hard. Most pick too challenging a project or can't figure out how to pick a project that interests them.Anyway, I appreciate your opinions!",

        "body": "In Python, `super()` and `Class.__init__()` are related to how inheritance works.In the first example where you use `super().__init__(side, side)`, `super()` is a special function that refers to the parent class in the method resolution order (MRO). When you call `super().__init__(side, side)`, it’s essentially telling Python to look up the inheritance chain and call the `__init__` method of the parent class (which in this case is `Rectangle`). This allows the `Square` class to inherit and use the initialization logic of the `Rectangle` class without explicitly referencing `Rectangle` by name. When `super().__init__(side, side)` is called, it sets the `height` and `width` attributes of the `Square` instance (which is `s`), because `super()` is calling `Rectangle.__init__` internally and passing the values to it.Now, in the second example, `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)` does something similar but directly. You’re calling the `__init__` method of the `Rectangle` class explicitly. Here, `Rectangle.__init__` sets the `height` and `width` attributes on the `Square` instance (`s`) in the same way, but this time, you’re directly referencing the parent class.In both cases, the key point is that calling `__init__` on a class (whether via `super()` or directly) will set up the attributes of the instance. When you do `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)`, it sets `self.height` and `self.width` on the `Square` instance, just as if the `Square` class was directly calling `Rectangle`'s `__init__` method.The reason this works, even though `Rectangle` is a class, is because `Rectangle.__init__` is a method that belongs to the class and can be called just like any other method. The instance (`self` in `Square`) is passed along, so it has access to the attributes defined within the method.",

All classes in python return objects when instanciated. `super()` returns what the documentation calls a \"proxy object\".https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#superProxy objects are special. They are bound to a type and an instance of a type. When any method is called on them, they search the [method-resolution-order (MRO)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) for this combination, and call that instead.The actual call signature of `super`:```super(type, object_or_type)```Takes these 2 arguments. Usually, `type` is a class, `object_or_type` is an instance of that class. When called without argument but directly followed by a method call, these arguments default to the enclosing class and the calling instance.Therefore, let's break down what happens in the case you described:> super is a class therefore super().__init__(side, side) should create instance of the class super1. `super()` returns a proxy object, bound to the type `` and the current instance of that class2. `.__init__` tells the proxy object: \"Search the MRO for this instance of this class 'upwards' for a method called `__init__`\"3. The search determines that the method to call is `Rectangle.__init__`4. `(side, side)` now calls `Rectangle.__init__` with `side` as the value for both arguments",

Learn C (great book: https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/C%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition%20(OCR).pdf) -- do practice problems, write a few programs to understand how programs are written and execute on your computer2. Learn some computer architecture -- helps you understand what your CPU is doing and the purpose of a GPU3. You should have spent A LOT of time on doing steps 1 and 2, so it depends what you want to do from here. The two most common applications: 3a. If you're interested in programming on a GPU for AI reasons, then study what kind of math operations are performed for most deep learning applications (e.g., matrix multiplication). 3b. If you want to do something related to graphics, start with something like OpenGL (https://learnopengl.com/)It's important to lay a solid understanding of programming and computer fundamentals before diving into parallel programming. Parallel programming APIs like OpenCL are a huge abstraction, and it assumes the user has a solid understanding of how they want to parallelize their workload and exactly how they're going to manipulate the GPU.If you have any questions, I'd be happy to chat for a bit!EDIT: Here's a good book for learning about computer architecture. If you're interested, it would be a good project to implement the ISA they talk about in C after you've gotten comfortable with the language: \"Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition\" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy",

        "body": "Well put it like this:in the first case, each method only does one thing. this is helpful. It also signals clearly what each method is doing, which is autodocumenting. in the second case you have to look a little closer. And while it can be convenient to use \"field\" as a variable that means people could call it like: GetEntry(someVariable, someValue);leaving you with no idea what is going on. (or whether someVariable actually exists). now imagine this call is being done in code outside of your reach. (a client library for instance). you wouldn't know what variables they are using. so if you ever change the database you won't have an automatic warning that the field they are selecting on exists. Except at runtime which is not ideal. If you make the same changes in the first example, (remove a findBy..... because the field is no longer offered), the client will get a compilation error when a developer updates to the latest version of your library. which they will be much happier about than an error in the rare situation a user sorts a table by pressing a UI element the developers never touch.I know what I write is slightly charged / exaggerated but I tried to sketch the use cases where you would know the difference.I think you are falling into a beginner trap where more code looks inefficient. And creating a godly one-liner that handles everything / runs the whole program looks good. But more verbose self-documenting code generally is code that will have less bugs later on. because you won't be the only programmer working on your code. You may not even be at the employer when someone tries to work on a function / replaces something. for instance in your case: it is easy to replace findById with findByIdOrSecondaryId because it'll be clear where you use it and you'll get a compiler error if you forget one since the original doesn't exist. But it is entirely possible you overlook GetObject( \"id\") (possibly because of whitespace differences and such.Think about cleanness of code in the sense that it should be straightforward to read. Don't shy away from extra functions. However what you can do is have findByName and findByEmail and findById all internally call GetEntry(string field, string value) if you wish. (to share error handling/recovery/etc). that way you present stable methods to the outside world and you can have more generic reusable functions for internal use.none of this is absolute truth of course, just advice",

For another customer (a university), we built a search form where students could search for and apply to different courses. The students were seldom users, had no knowledge of different parameters, so had just one free-form text input that we matched against a special database view where we merged all relevant data from different tables and columns into one against which we matched the query (the more words that matched in a resulting row, the higher the score the result got).A search index could be an alternative; again, much depends on the type of application you build and your requirements.",

I have to have some other information in order to actually use your method. Maybe you added the valid fields to the documentation for the function, and maybe that comes up as part of intellisense, but then I have to read through the description and I could still mistype one of the field names.With individual methods I hit . on your model and intellisense gives me a list of all the ways I can use it.

Some aspects of game programming are much harder than the usual fields of programming.I would say it's only good if they're already interested in programming and it focuses on the hard parts of game programming.If the course focuses on how to make a game, then they'll learn how to make a game, not programming. Almost no game design courses teach any amount of programming.If it's writing their own game engine or something, then it teaches a lot more.Also you can't say \"learn to program\" and \"JavaScript\" with a straight face. It's sad to see the focus entirely on WebDev. What is the goal: do you want them to learn programming or WebDev? GameDev is not a good way to learn WebDev.If you look at the CS50 course, you can see the order they go in: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/)They actually begin by having people make a game. But they basically learn no programming from it because it's using Scratch. I actually think that week could have been replaced with something better. Notice how they go all the way through an intro course and through Data Structures before they even start WebDev.I spent many years making games on Atari XE and graphing calculators. I went to a community college after that and learned basic programming. But a single Data Structures course was more impactful on my ability to program than all those years of experience combined.Also when I tutored math, people always said the same thing. They hated math until they learned it properly, then they loved it. They were so happy doing it. Teachers focus too much on making things \"fun\" instead of making things understandable.

Game dev is tricky for beginners, because you really need to have your fundamentals down, and then you need to add some other cocepts: oop, graphics, and some math. I teach standard cli python until midterm, and then switch to the engine for the second half. I ended up writing my own wrapper to pygame. It encapsulates all the math, and adds some nice features. I also wrote a version in javascript. In general, students find my section of the class is more difficult than some others, but they still enjoy it.All my stuff is open source, so DM me if you want links.",

        "body": "I have tried making some introductory programming curricula based on making games, as well as an advanced DSA course - not as \"game design courses\", but simply using games as the applications that the students had to build.I still think it is an excellent idea, and it works really well, especially because when writing a game, you naturally run the code over and over, and it is never exactly the same, so you constantly discover new issues, more things to learn. Whereas if you build a program to display a list of items from a database, the moment you got a list, you are done, and leave that part of the code. Also, when you make a game you feel like you've built something - and you are proud to show it to others, and let them play it. Whereas when you've made a form for entry into a database, well ... :)And I believe that you can learn any programming topic from writing games - there's almost no single algorithm, pattern or data structure that doesn't fit into some game or other.However, I've had some issues - mostly with students and especially other teachers not understanding what they actually learned, so I'll give you some of them as \"warnings\" - not warnings against doing it, but warnings about how it might be received.* Students have a really hard time transferring skills between writing different kinds of software - when they learned how to write games, they didn't understand how it could be used in database-applications, when they learned frontend coding, they didnt' understand how it could be used in backend, then they learned terminal-applications they didn't understand how it could be applied to web-applications, and so on. It is important to add other kinds of applications using the same patterns as they learned in the games - so they don't think that it is a \"games course\", but see how learning to code with games, is just learning to code.* Students are extremely scared of math - not just matrix-calculations, or trigonometry, but something as simple as ratios, converting a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 50 and 300 is almost impossible for them to grasp. And in games there's a lot of math. Don't be discouraged by it, just be prepared to spend A LOT of time explaining even the simplest calculations.* Some students actively dislike having to create or even obtain graphics and other assets. But on the other hand they don't like just being given assets and \"forced\" to use them - expect to spend quite a bit of time explaining how to prepare those as well :)* As games get a bit more complex, there is a lot of prep-work in building the level or setting up the code for input. I recommend re-using code throughout the course, and copying in earlier \"blocks\" from some games to re-use later, so the students don't feel like they spend all their time typing in \"platform code\".* A lot of programming students nowadays actually don't know that many \"simple\" games, so it might be necessary with a bit of games history as well, to teach them about top-down, platforms, scrollers, shooters, and so on. I was surprised at how few of my references my students actually recognized - even when it got to board games!But otherwise, I think that it is a really, really good idea - and don't listen to the \"haters\" talking about how games programming and JavaScript isn't \"real\" programming! Every kind of programming is programming, and if something can inspire students to build more on their own, it is even better!",

        "body": ">I haven't really built anything worth notingNobody's first projects are anything worth noting! You're still in the learning stage. That's fine - we all start at the same place.>I made a calculator that you can use your terminal but that's pretty much it.How does it work? Can I type in 5 \\* 6 + (3 - 4) / 8, and it will give me the right answer, or is it more restricted than that? Can it handle fractions? Can it handle exponentiation? Factorials? Basic polynomial algebra? If I give it an unusual expression like 3 - (-(-2)), does it handle it as expected? If I give it a syntactically illegal expression like \"5 + \\* 5\", or a mathematically illegal expression like \"3 / 0\", does it handle it gracefully without crashing?There's a **lot** that goes into building a calculator, and this kind of thing might be an interesting project. If you're not interested in calculators, don't think of it as a calculator: think of it as \"teaching the computer to understand commands\". This is a whole field in its own right - tokenising, lexing, parsing, building syntax trees, Backus-Naur, and all that - and this is a (small but significant) step towards building something like a compiler. (As a side benefit, it will also make you better at understanding and reading certain kinds of documentation.)Also: when you do this, you'll probably want to reuse your old calculator code, but you might find that extending your code to accept these new features is more trouble than it's worth, and you have to rewrite it from scratch. Don't be afraid of doing this, even multiple times if you have to - in fact, I think it's a really good thing in the learning stage. Implementing individual features is one thing, but learning how to structure large projects in a clean and modular way - so that you can swap out features, upgrade them, rewrite them without changing all the rest of your code - is a skill in its own right.>I saw a guy build a snake game that was cool.Why not try building that yourself? Or Pac-Man, or Tetris. It can be in the terminal if you want - just redraw the board as a grid of characters every second - it'll look ugly, but that's fine.That said, if you're feeling up to something a bit more of a challenge, then why not learn to use a library like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)? That's a simple way of getting graphics onto the screen. Fair warning: once you start using external libraries, the difficulty **does** spike a little, because you're suddenly having to learn a whole new feature set that you know nothing about, with all of the syntactic difficulties that come along with it. In practice, what that means is you will spend a lot of time learning how to read documentation efficiently, which is also a crucial skill for a programmer.>I don't exactly know the full capabilities of c++ so I'm open to suggestions.Literally anything a computer can do, you can do it in C++. Most operating systems are written in C, which you can think of as a very bare-bones version of C++. Most modern programming languages have compilers / interpreters written in C/C++. Most browsers and web servers are written in C/C++. The main barrier here is not the capability of C++: it's the fact that even very \"simple\" software can be tens of thousands of lines of code, and you need to work towards that. So don't be afraid to rewrite things that people have already written before: they will be very valuable learning tools.",

Yes, the way your program is currently implemented may need only one instance of a Configuration. But software changes over time and I've seen it plenty of times that something was introduced as a singleton when only one instance of the thing was required and later it turned out that (under certain conditions) you need multiples of that thing. Something as simple as a test that runs the code that depends on the singleton twice can become impossible to implement properly. And refactoring a singleton away can be a lot of work.Another general issues with singletons is that you can access them from anywhere (as there often is a global Singleton::GetInstance() function or similar). This means that (as opposed to using dependency injection) it is hard to tell what code depends on the existence of that singleton, making it hard to reason about the code. And then there are other issues like initialization/deinitialization and dependencies between multiple singletons, etc. That's the reason why the singleton pattern is considered an anti-pattern.That being said there are common cases where I see singletons used frequently (e.g. for a clock or a logger object) where it can be justified but even for those I've seen it cause problems that they are implemented as singletons.For your specific case, I would not implement a Configuration as a singleton. The example you provide (multiple instances of calculations using their own copy of a Configuration object) is reason enough to not make it a singleton.",

The print layout quality is not great (it looks like it was Ctrl+P'ed from web pages) but the material there is solid, it has good programming examples and exercises.After you know C a bit, the GLIBC manual is pretty good. It is pretty comprehensive and has lots of nice little examples sprinkled throughout:[The GNU C Library - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://sourceware.org/glibc/manual/)If using entirely free materials I would first read The C Book (and do the exercises) and/or Beej's Guide to C (unfortunately no exercises in Beej's) before reading the GLIBC manual. Also, when reading such a manual, you don't read \"in linear order\" but you should read \"a la carte\" i.e. choose the topics that are interesting/relevant for you.",

This is rendering logic vs business logic, and it’s going to be a fundamental concept to understand at a software engineering level - not just one domain or language. Separation of concerns.But, how do you put basic stuff together to start building is your question. Basically… you just start. For learning at least. And you start over… many times. It’s like life. Take the learnings and the lickings into each future endeavor.Keep in mind though - if you bought a house, you wouldn’t want them to start by just randomly putting stuff together.

With ***NODEJS*** you can use **node-cron**, and it looks like this:`cron.schedule('0 8 * * *', () => {``console.log('Running scraping task at 8:00 AM every day');`By the way, if you are using *Ubuntu*, you can check *Crontab* and take a look at it, cos it's pretty similar. Is the way *Ubuntu* schedule tasks for the *OS* (and you can schedule some scripts in Ubuntu's crontab, I did one for example to always commit something to Github once a day).It's been a long time since I \"scrap\" a website, but I still think I can give it a try again. If you need some examples with *Node*, just tell me and I'll link the ones on my *Github*.Hope it helps.",

So, a good solution would be a chrome extension that grabs the current tab's link that you want to send to someone and it automatically shortens it using the bitly API or however you want and you can save it or copy it or create a QR code with it, whatever.

So you are probably going to have to:1. Find the location of what you are interested in.2. Find a pointer that points to that location.3. Find a pointer that points to the pointer that points to the location.Repeat step 3 until you find a memory location that reliable doesn't change. To make matters more difficult you may need a pointer that points before the location and an then increment it by an offset.

However, to get Windows to load an unsigned driver, you have to use the boot menu to disable driver signature enforcement.The driver will expose an API (accessed through IOCTL calls) that will allow a user mode program to pass it a process ID. You will then write a user mode program that will find or get the process ID of the target application and pass it up to the driver.The driver can then use functions like MmProbeAndLockPages, and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache to build MDLs for the virtual memory regions that you are interested in in the target application, lock them into physical RAM, then map them back down into the virtual address space of your user mode program.Once you have done that, the user mode program will have a \"live view\" into the memory of the target application, and can write whatever values it wants to disk.That is assuming you have solved the problem of figuring out which virtual address you are interested in in the target application.Note that this is all quite difficult, and not something for a novice programmer to take on. I used to do this kind of stuff for work, when I was working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on it. It was infinitely easier for me because I wrote the code for both applications and the driver, plus my driver was signed.

For example, you can't really build your own list in Python because it would itself have to be made out of lists, since there is no data structure provided which is more primitive than that. It would be nonsense to try. If you want to learn data structures, I would highly recommend learning C. C++ and Java are possible choices too but those languages are quite a bit more complicated, whereas plain C is quite \"bare bones\". It's not only easier to learn as a langauge, but its primitives are truly primitive. In C you actually build real data structures - linked lists, array lists, hash tables, etc... rather than create silly simulations of them.",

Although its not directly relevant to my job, I am fascinated by it. And actually, it does improve the way I write TypeScript and stuff. In my opinion, you never lose out by getting the fundamentals, but its possible to do stuff without knowing anything about what is going on at a deeper level.",

The 2008 Financial Crisis caused a 2nd \"bubble burst\".Go into CS because you enjoy it, but don't forget that the reason we get paid well is because not too many of us enrolled in Computer Science because so many people thought the bubble was bursting.Computation isn't going anywhere. The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades. AI will not replace programmers any time soon (in fact, it's becoming clear that it enables more modalities for computation and we'll need more).It's silly to me that we jump right to the notion of AI replacing programmers and don't discuss all of the types of jobs that use a subset of the total skills required to be a good software engineer.Logically, before you see a programmer wholesale replaced you'd have to see Translators/Court Stenographers/Draftsmen/Accountants replaced. They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).There are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.It stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output? You need LLMs to produce code that works 99%+ of the time, out of the gate, to hope to replace us, and/or have an extremely robust system of feedback loops plumbed back into the LLM with 0% hallucination. We're nowhere near that.I love LLMs in my own workflows, but it takes my experience to get the LLM on the right track even on small workflows. Even with specificity, I'd estimate that the LLM gets it right way less than 30% of the time, and it's my ability to debug and suggest fixes is what gets me to working solution.",

Because the way this society is going, you're going to need a financial safety net larger than you're thinking right now. The societal safety nets are disappearing.If anything happens to you and your capacity to bring in money, you're going to wish you had enough money such that your *money* generates money -- i.e., investments so large that you can live off the interest alone. And you're not going to have the leftover funds to invest with an average salary if you're ever laid off, get sick, get into a car accident, etc.Most of those people whose jobs you're eying won't be able to financially recover from a bad diagnosis, let alone retire.Think back to when you were in college and money was tight. That's going to be your life without a good income. You just forgot what that's like.If you don't hear anything else I'm saying, just remember that you can always find ways to socialize and engage with your interests with a high salary. But a low salary is a limiting factor that puts hard a ceiling on every other aspect of your life. And I truly believe a person's earning power is the single hardest thing to change in life. So hard, in fact, that most people never do it.Only quit your current line of work at your current company if you just can't stand to do it anymore and it makes you absolutely miserable. I'm talking, you *dread* getting up in the morning and your evenings are spent agonizing about having to go back to work the next day. To the point where the dread consumes you and it becomes your whole life.Beyond that, consider yourself lucky to be able to do what you do, for the salary you do it at.**Edit:** If you really don't want to do that kind of work long term, the best thing you can do is look into FIRE-ing and retire early. You have the salary to do that and do it comfortably. But your friends with low salaries would have to live like literal paupers to do even half of that. I'm talking worse than you lived when money was tight in college.",

They were unlimited, but during an employee's first year they did accrued PTO. After I had started, the company decided to get rid of that policy and make everyone unlimited from day 1. In order to do that, they paid out all the accrued PTO we had all gained. It actually worked in my benefit, I still was able to take the same amount of vacation I otherwise would've, but I had already accrued a bunch which they had to buy out, so I got a nice fat bonus.Even if your husband's in a State that doesn't require a company to do that, they *might* still do it anyways to keep people happy.

        "body": "Go for it. IMO the toxicity of Meta is overstated on places like Blind, and Google's culture is worse than it used to be. It's true that Meta is overall more \"intense\" but what this really means is that people don't coast. Getting high ratings and raises is very doable, which is why everyone is trying to do it, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The E4 -> E5 promotion is probably easier to get at Meta.The biggest differences in my mind are:1. Meta is more customer metrics driven; a good project is a project that made the numbers go up. Whereas Google is more focused on alignment: if the senior engineers agreed your design was good, and your leadership thought it was a good idea, and you executed it well, then it was a good project regardless of what happens after. On the positive side, this means that at Google you can spend more of your time on risky, speculative things; at Meta you have to think about your time more like an investment portfolio, with some things you're pretty sure will pay off to \"fund\" your riskier ideas. On the negative side, as you advance in your career at Google you have to spend more of your time sucking up to leadership, because there is no objective way to determine whether your projects were good so it is more of a popularity contest.2. Google has better engineering practices, infrastructure, and documentation. This follows from Meta being an entertainment company; Instagram users will come back even if the app crashes sometimes, but Google Cloud customers wouldn't tolerate this. Things break pretty often at Meta. The downside of this is that you spend more time firefighting during oncall. The upside is that it's much easier to ship things. Code and design reviews are less nitpicky and there are fewer barriers to just doing things. It does mean that more knowledge at Meta is in people's heads rather than written down, so you have to build out a network of experts. There is more chatter and context switching as a result, although overall there are fewer meetings which is nice.If you were someone who disliked the bureaucracy at Google, Meta will be a good change of pace. They are both good companies to work at, it's all about what you value.",

Let's have Chad Jebity do it!The result was this very large codebase that essentially creates deployment stages for every workbook that gets added into the pipeline and it iterates through a list to populate the data. It literally takes 20-30 minutes for me to run the pipeline and validate a change that usually takes 1 click in the browser.I've been trying to explain to them that this won't scale and will eventually have to get replaced, but trying to get them to understand Big O notation was like drawing blood from a stone.

I find the CLI based agents really solid for querying my code base about something I might want to do, and when the task is small enough that the CLI can spin up something that I can read in a few seconds to determine if it's correct. But I found that \\_miromanaging\\_ the agent in Cursor is really just not how I want to develop with AI on a daily basis. It doesn't bring me joy, and if it doesn't bring me joy, my work is going to suffer and bugs will slip through. I'm not afraid of the vibe coding revolution tbh, the only thing I am sort of concerned about is that organizations might start demanding certain text editors as mandatory.",

Also OP. MD is tiny, people that like to shoot and have it as a BIG part of their identity would have moved to VA. Yes it can be more expensive and time consuming....but you have to pay to play when you move to the tristate area/NOVAAgain...something you should have factored in.

A little closer to home, think about Kubernetes and Docker - again, *absolutely world-shattering* for the industries it affects, a market of somewhere in the $200B range, that replaced entire teams of inefficient human labor... but it's just part of our tools today, and it had a net positive effect on jobs.I think it's not going to live up to its promise, my guess is we'll see a \"crash\" more like we saw with cloud tech 20-odd years ago. The 10% of useful tools will stick around, and the 90% of AI cash grabs / unsustainable businesses will die off.Also, most forms of gen AI are **currently** *wildly* unprofitable - the market is currently operating under the assumption that costs will fall dramatically, and/or benefits will continue to improve. I think that's going to be an interesting factor in whichever future ends up being true. There's fair evidence to support falling costs, and (so far) there's been a decent history of rising benefits. There's a lot of ground to cover though.",

Eventually people are going to be too unhappy, and stop wanting to throw money at subpar AI solutions. McDonalds investors aren't going to be happy after the Nth 3rd party fails to create a solution that gets AI to provide real returns, and I doubt McDonald's is seriously going to attempt to string together an AI system in-house to make something that actually can.As a small aside, I think Apple is actually making the smartest move in the room, and talking a big talk about AI to keep investors happy, but just waiting for all the hype to wash over before bailing out on their supposed \"AI efforts\" (which all seem to be marketing material, rather than anything that is hogging up engineering resources).",

There are a number of reasons why this could be justified: \\- another company or another division used the same tool that your company is using. They were just issued a significant fine or regulatory finding because its use was ineffective. (more on this below) Your CEO wants to avoid being tarred with the same brush. \\- the CEO thinks too many people were aware of the use of sapience. And therefore the investment wasn't paying off. CEO figures to cut the recurring maintenance cost of the third party product and your boss has said they can build an in-house tool that will be just as effective. On point 1 you should be aware that regulators regularly share findings with each other. So if company A gets a 'noted deficiency' the other auditors look for that in other companies. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_It's also possible that your SVP is being defensive. S/He's wary that if/when something goes wrong they will be the scapegoat. Possibly feels that the political winds are blowing the wrong way. S/He's setting this up so s/he has evidence if the feces hits the oscillating wind generator. Another way your SVP could be protecting themself is if they know there is some regulation or law that requires email retention or email monitoring. They are proactively avoiding a whole series of audit comments and/or regulatory comments. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_It would be interesting to know the dynamic between the Board of Directors and CEO. The Board should have a Board Member responsible for Compliance / Audit. If you can identify that person you could send an anonymous email cc'ing the Board Chair as well asking whether they were aware that email monitoring was being discontinued. Don't say anything about someone building a replacement. See what happens.",

        "body": "Before you entirely abandon this field, here are some things that might help.1,000 applications is intense. But applying online is also a saturated channel and an increasingly inefficient one. In the past 3 years, a bunch of recruiters got laid off, and according to our data, there are about 3X fewer recruiters working now than there were in the first half of 2022.At the same time, the number of (non-spam) applicants for eng jobs has 3X'ed since the first half of 2022. I don't have numbers for how many spam applications companies are getting, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's probably another 3-5X increase.So, recruiters are maybe 30-50X less productive than they were a couple of years ago. Which, for you, means that applying online isn't the best approach.Before you completely give up and switch to a field that takes over 10 years to start making money, try doing outreach instead. You can give yourself a deadline. Something like, \"If I can't get some responses by January 2026, I'm going to med school.\" And until then, I'd focus on trying to get in the door.So, what to do? I'm one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We have a whole chapter on how to do outreach that includes some templates, and it's free: [https://bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters) It's the first document, and just go to Chapter 7: Getting in the Door.When you do your outreach, in the part of the template where you should mention something unique about you, try writing about how you were able to automate your job. I bet it's a good story.Finally, if you post a link to your resume/LinkedIn in a response to this comment, I'd be happy to review and share some notes. That said, you (and others in your shoes) probably don't need to spend lots of time on your resumes because recruiters typically scan them for brands, and either you have them or you don't. Anyone who tells you to spend a lot of time polishing your resume is probably selling snake oil.",

But try to build up 6 months/1 year experience. Enough to hop on to a different job. I speak from personal experience. My first internship I made under 1000 a month for a company with like 5 people. I then switched to a bigger startup where I made about 25 an hour. After that I was able to land a Microsoft internship which was a big step. One of the things that helped me get that job is that I also did some side projects which made a good impression during the interview and buffed my resume. From there I went to work full time at Meta, and now I’m making over 400k a year. So ideally you build up over time, and try to constantly learn, get experience, and move up. Hopes this helps.",

There's a lot of talk about tech being a boom-and-bust industry, but even to an experienced tech exec nowadays they've seen three busts:1. Dot com2. Great Recession3. TodayThe difference with the first two is that tech (and especially web-based software + SaaS) has grown its talent pool significantly since 2008. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Once companies set in these Three Horsemen of the (Tech) Apocalypse (RTO, Offshoring, and Stack Ranking), those companies in the past would be seen as \"failing\" culturewise. However, in 2023-2025 the normal cycle of job changing was disrupted, so you have a lot of built-up dissatisfaction from people who want to change jobs, but can't find new opportunities. When opportunities arise at these companies with those qualities, the new folks may be arriving from something that was an even worse dumpster fire. A good example is GEICO. They fired swaths of their IT/SWE and have a 2.6 on Glassdoor. They are pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as large companies. However, if someone was working at Geico and transitioned into something like Amazon, they might find it a breath of fresh air.The real problem at the end of the day is an oversupply of engineers. Fix the problem at the source and reduce enrollments.",

This is really common with junior engineers - they start making progress and gain a little independence, think they're much more self sufficient than they actually are because they have no perspective on things, and then can't accept feedback because it means reassessing their view of their work as maybe not quite as perfect as they'd imagined. If you can learn to accept feedback and address the good stuff and let the incorrect stuff slide off your back without a strong reaction you'll be much better off.",

While in the best of days most people with talent and ambition are better off in the largest tech employers, bad times give a better talent pool to startups, and that better talent pool leads to higher chances of successful ones.Just go look at founding years of most unicorns: You can see that there's cadres with multiple huge successes, and others with absolutely nothing, and they all line up like this.",

I went to WGU and it was super affordable and I learned a lot. No matter what if you do pursue CS you need to do side projects and additional outside learning. Side projects are very important and it shows that you enjoy / are interested in CS. Speaking of, make sure before you go to school for CS I highly recommend doing some self learning and make something small. I know a lot of people who go to school for CS, spend the money and realize they don't like it mid-degree and switch OR even worse get their whole degree and not like to code. Make sure when selecting your major you aren't just picking something that \"makes a lot of money\" but also consider what you think is interesting. Then consider how you get there, and in many many cases you don't need a degree depending on what you decide. The last advice I'll give is that college is always there. I get the impression you're younger, and from experience I think going to college right after high-school is one of the worst things about society. In the past going to college and \"figuring things out\" wasn't a big deal because it was priced very very differently. Now due to the cost of most colleges I'd rather recommend a new high school grad to spend time working and looking into career fields they find interesting. Then reach out and find people doing those things and see if you can find someone who will help answer any questions about what its actually like doing those things and the day-to-day.",

Re- outsourcing Outsourcing or delegation of labor has been around for my entire career. Firms tend to dabble in an effort to think they cs save money and that staff are fungible. What’s not fungible is learning and understanding of vestigial projects. Where outsourcing works is when the team is seen as another dev group and can solve projects entirely on their own without constant supervision from home office because staff have relocated there and the firm is invested for the indefinite future. Otherwise it’s executives dabbling with consulting groups that fail because they need to call in more staff to do what is being asked or write better requirements. Re - AI Just another set of tools that really depend on where they are sourcing more than anything else. Think of moving from paper to a computer in the 70s to do bookkeeping. The general ledger was a legit book where inflows and outflows were recorded. I worked on wall street where funds would calculate their values and holdings at the end of day by hand. Think of a circular saw , if you don’t know how to cut 4x8 sheet of plywood well your just going to do it faster than a handsaw. Same deal with a car - it’s great you can drive it but if you don’t have a general clue of where you’re going you are going to go somewhere quickly.

Sure - after ten minutes of inactivity it would save changes and close. But, one of the managers totally screwed up their edits and those changes were saved.So I was asked if I could prompt user to see if they wanted changes saved or not, before auto-closing due to inactivity. I pointed out that that would defeat the entire purpose of automatically closing it because, you know, *they’d walked away from it*. So I was told to auto close it *without* saving - except next I was told that on the first business day of the month, some of the managers entered data and would sometimes have it opened but inactive for more than ten minutes while they were working on it, and one had just lost their desired changes. So could I have it auto-close after ten minutes of inactivity, without saving, unless it was the first business day of the month, in which case I should auto-close but save it first?An. Excel.

And this was at Target, not some tiny startup!But after that I got really interesting, researchy work, lots of space to learn (I was building a new supply chain optimization system, but I didn't have any operations research background starting out!) and a ton of flexibility, scope and autonomy. I know lots of teams that have much \"harder\" interviews but then the actual role turns into just doing dull, bite-sized tickets assigned by somebody else.So my only conclusion is that a team's hiring practices are, at most, a relatively weak signal about the team culture and the nature of the work.I would not try to draw any strong conclusions from your hiring experience. Instead, I'd try talking to the hiring manager, talking to somebody on the team and asking questions to understand the day-to-day experience as well as the broader context around the team and the work. This isn't full-proof—I just left a miserable role at a company despite talking to multiple past coworkers who seemed happy there—but, with social questions, *nothing* is fool-proof. So I just try to get the best impression I can, but also remember that all sorts of things can happen.",

After recognizing that, it's basic unwanted emotion management: Acknowledge the feeling and what it's telling you (this job is important to you), then let it go. I find once I'm in flow, I'm fine, so it's just getting over that initial hump that takes effort. You may have to try a few times to get past the feeling. It's ok if this is difficult at first. This is an important soft skill, and like all skills, it takes practice.In my experience, it's actually really rare to be fired for performance unless you do like, literally nothing for months. Usually it's some political game happening 3 levels above you that you have no control over, and performance is just the excuse they use to justify someone sacrificing their pawn to take a rook. I have seen so many amazing engineers get fired for \"performance\" who were certainly out performing me.The best way to protect yourself is to just be reliable, and get your work done. You can't hit your target if you're watching everyone else draw their bow.~ Sincerely, a FAANG worker that has survived 3 layoffs (and probably a fourth, soon :grimacing_face:)P.S.: there are two books that may help, though I've never read them.

All blind really tells you is that everyone you're talking to is guaranteed to be written by someone who has a valid company email for the company they claim to work in. That's really all. As a platform, it encourages extremely negative interactions, and the anonymity means there's no consequences of either being brutally honest but also of lying. And of course, the biggest issue: there's no way of verifying almost anything people say. I'm not saying that people always lie, there's a lot of frank and honest discussion that happens. I'm saying that you can't tell when people are lying, because you don't know who they are, can't really verify anything, and there are zero downsides to lying.I would also not call it representative. Blind users don't represent a majority of employees at most companies, and the site self-selects for the kind of people who _want_ to engage in the kind of negativity you get on that side. Because of all that, I'd take most things there with a grain of salt.",

I’ve long said that I think tech lead is the absolute worst job you can have and I think that that often falls right in line with this.The problem is that you’re still expected to contribute code like any other engineer, but you start taking on more project management responsibilities that require heavy context switching. You end up doing 70% of two jobs that require very different skill sets and I think the only way most people manage is to put in extra hours.Once you’re beyond that level, I think your WLB actually starts to get easier because you’re no longer expected to write as much code. The problems you focus on are harder, but you have the ability to make more time to think on and you’re able to step away from the day to day work more.So yeah, I guess my point is that I think to get to any level above senior, you likely have to push through a few years of shit WLB, but beyond the senior level it actually starts to get better and not worse.",

This is for multiple (usually two) teams concurrently. I am there to spot opportunities for collaboration and leverage, find different solutions to problems, to nudge people to think about different approaches. Sometimes I fill in most of the duties of a tech lead if someone is out.Part of the reason I do a bit of everything is that I have been promoted three times in seat. I am sure it would feel different joining a team as above-senior rather than previously having been in the lower roles on the same team. It's not like I'm going to refuse to do the things I did before, if there is an urgent need. It's just that normally there are other people to delegate to.Because I don't really hold any primary accountability for anything and have had managers largely leave me to do as I see fit, it doesn't come with much stress.

And I did get a lot done. But the key thing is that my day-to-day was flexible, so I could adjust what I was doing and how hard I was working based on circumstances or even just based on how I was feeling. I got a lot done by doing high-leverage work and figuring out more effective ways to achieve my high-level aims rather than working long hours.But that only worked because my manager was willing to trust me to make real decisions not just about how I was working day-to-day but also about what I was doing. I could go out, talk to people, understand their actual constraints and the interaction points between my system and other teams, then scope my work based on that rather than aiming for arbitrary deadlines or roadmaps. When you have the ability to just solve real problems rather than chasing output for the sake of output—and when nobody is trying to optimize your \"capacity\"—you can get a lot done without working crazy hours or burning out.On the other hand, there are lots of teams and managers that do not operate like that. I've seen company planning processes that were clearly designed to put lots of artificial pressure on people and in those situations, yeah, a higher level role might be more stressful than a lower-level role. But even at those companies, at some point, you'll only be able to perform at a given level by doing high-leverage work rather than just working harder, so, if you don't burn out along the way, you'll learn how to have a large impact with reasonable(ish) effort.",

That makes me less visible during big events so it slows down my progress but I’ve done enough of the “hero” thing in the past that I don’t care to do it again regularly but can of needed. I’ve also switched into management which required a lot more after hours work than when I was in hero mode, and it was less fun, so I switched back.So no it doesn’t require more time investment while being above senior level but you need to pace yourself to find the correct balance to get there.",

Is working a LITTLE MORE than 40 \"killing yourself?\"I'm not software but I am a senior engineer of a different discipline in a different industry (chemical engineer, at EPC), and if someone was only ever \"working\" 9 to 5, we'd be suspicious that they were working sub 40 hours a week, 35-40 ish. Given we \"bill\" every hour because we have to invoice and get paid for our designs by clients who want them, 40 hours on your time sheet means 40 hours of work. Not... 35 + paid lunch. You can and will get fired for that. You're free to report 35 + 5 hours OH, but people would ask why this is the case. I am positive I will be techsplained how software is different (yes I am aware, this isn't the point here).Not to get all Office Space Stan on people, but doing the bare minimum with respect to anything generally does not get you ahead. 9 to 5 and anything more being \"killing myself\" really sounds like 15 pieces of flare and no more. This isn't going to be rewarded, and it can be difficult to make a lasting impact if the bare minimum is all you're willing to do.It might be different in software, but senior around my parts implies a willingness to put in the work / time / hours when it is necessary. Projects succeed or fail on the willingness of the senior leadership corps to do what is necessary. Seniors are the critical force that holds the project together, that is their impact. After that, whether or not you experienced WLB during this time frame will be by how well a project is run, project schedule, how well defined a project is... all of which conspire to define how crazy a project is.For your case, it REALLY sounds like if you want that high TC, senior title, with ability to make impact, you're GOING to need to make peace with high pressure and hectic environments, and then critically, be willing to put in the time when it is necessary. So if your current work DOESN'T require this extra time and extra availability, then you're likely golden. Keep on going on. However, are your coworkers experiencing stress, working early, working late, to get things done while you're over here working 9 to 5? Are you complaining openly any time work requires deviation from this (don't do this if you are)? If you're working 9 to 5 while everyone else is working 7 - 6 and drowning... then you're NOT going to get senior there. You're NOT in the trenches with your team. You'll have to quit and get hired as senior somewhere else (good luck with that in this environment).For reference here... \"Projects\" I work on are 1.5 to 2 year affairs, the larger of which can easily be 1000-1250 FTE for factories/sites that can run 20-25 billion once tools are put in, with base infrastructure being between ~5-8 billion. Error bars on these projects exceed the total cost of other megaprojects. So these are huge... long affairs, involving many people. My point is, that for the longer durations on this, they look and feel a lot more like traditional work. People will remember if you put the bare minimum in or not and if the project suffered because people didn't go above and beyond.For context, I am currently on a mega project, we can't add anymore staff because we don't have any, and the project would benefit GREATLY from 45-50 hour weeks out of our junior engineering core for a month or three to get caught up. A few are doing this, and their scope situation is improving, but several others are not, and they're behind. Whether or not this is recoverable, is an interesting question. I'm not lead here... thankfully. So we have this weird situation where everyone is drowning short term, and the group is splitting into people who make an effort, and people who do the bare minimum. The career consequences of which won't be felt for years. For what it is worth, engineering staff gets straight time OT on billed work, so 60 hours means a 50% increase. It's our bonus structure to reward additional work.",

Interviewing is a task where working engineers are incentivized to minimize their time on it. This means that they want interviews that take them zero time to prep and “objective” evaluation criteria. Twenty years ago Google made headlines by asking brain teasers in interviews like “how many ping pong balls would fit in a jumbo jet?” This led to the rise of cargo-cult interview processes where you just grab two leetcode medium questions to ask in a 60 minute interview. If we run seven rounds like that then we can claim that we only hire the smartest 0.1% of all engineers. (Approximately none of that is true, btw.)In other words, it’s popular because interviewers are lazy and there’s a huge population seeking jobs.Here’s my advice: give yourself a time limit to practice this stuff, but take s many real interviews as you can—even just for practice (and even if you fail). If you find a role that *doesn’t* do these kind of lazy interviews *go there* — the culture you see in the interview process is the culture you will see at the company.",

        "body": "Quick caveat that if you're in India, I have no idea if this applies to you.In my experience, which admittedly is only about 6 years so maybe a grey beard can correct me, is that the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that a technical interview is like a test at school. Most of the time they are not, and if you come across a company that does treat interviews that way, you don't want to work there anyway.A technical interview that's administered well and evaluated fairly is an evaluation of your problem solving process and your understanding of the technology you're working with. Here are my tips, many of which I've gotten from FAANG recruiters so I assume they're good for most of the industry:- Do not start coding right away. Collecting requirements is a good thing, and something that good interviewers will appreciate.- Always think out loud. You're better off talking through a problem than keeping your entire process internal. It allows the interviewer to hear how you arrive at a solution, what you're taking into consideration, and even allows them to interject if they have a suggestion or you've misunderstood the problem.- As you're outlining and then coding your solution, talk through what you're doing and mention trade offs. Stuff like \"I'm going to use DFS here instead of BFS because....\" will demonstrate to the interviewer that you're not just reciting a memorized solution and you understand the options before you.- Do not get nervous if you get stuck. I'm naturally a bit nervous, and my first reaction is to get very sweaty if I'm not sure what to do next and it's cost me positions before. When you get stuck, just stay calm and talk it through with the interviewer. Most of the time they're happy to provide a hint or two, and as long as you don't come across as entirely clueless, it won't count against you. I would even go so far as to say it might help you a little, since someone who gets stuck isn't using an AI cheat tool. At least they know they're not being lied to. In summary, the technical interview isn't a test of whether or not you can invert a binary tree from memory. It's an opportunity to see how you solve problems, and the more junior the position, the more important coachability becomes, so taking hints and implementing them is not only ok, it's a good thing. Best of luck in your interviews. Just relax and work your way through the problem and you'll be fine.",

That said, a good interviewer should be nudging with \"You can probably start coding now\" or similar, when you've caught all the cases they expect you to.Also; I give a strong hint that I'm really only interested in the core algorithm, not the data classes, or really even method signatures.

You're collecting all the requirements upfront, which takes a large amount of time, and you only start once everything's extremely well defined.Instead, maybe start approaching interviews with an agile approach. Sure ask your questions, but at the same time aim to get *something* on paper as quickly as possible. Get something going, and then ask clarifying questions as new things pop up while you're implementing. You don't need to spend 15 minutes asking questions before you're able to at least *start* coding, right? The questions aren't *that* vague. You don't need to be \"fast\", I think they're expecting you to be \"agile\" and take an incremental approach. Just like they don't expect you to arrive at the optimal solution the first time, they expect you to arrive at the brute force solution which you then iterate on to improve.I'm just hypothesizing here, maybe I'm way off base. I'm not the greatest interviewer, but my interviews are very much agile. I'm extremely communicative throughout, but I jump into running through examples ASAP, and get what code I can written ASAP. I can work out ambiguities and questions as I go.All that said, in the current job market, you don't need to be \"perfect\". I job hopped in 2024, which was also a very bad market, and for my current job I completely flopped one of the interviews. I did great at the backend oriented question, handled all the system design questions with ease, and then they hit me with some frontend stuff which is not my forte.

I’ve worked at 3 different startups and “guy pivoting careers from physics to programming” or “guy coming back to work after a 2 year parental leave” weren’t uncommon archetypes, they only care about you moving quickly and getting shit done. Once you do a year or so at a startup doing some generalist work, you can go back to whatever role or company that appeals best to you without worrying about the gap. I do have some doubts on whether grad school is the move though, you’ll be burning way too much money in tuition + it’ll keep you occupied and away from full time work (on top of your 2-3 year gap) = all for very little marginal gains.Also, take most of the advice from this subreddit with a grain of salt, it mostly self-selects for unemployed new grads who complain about how the job market is impossible (yes it is definitely harder but not remotely “give up and find a different career” hard, if you’ve some experience under the belt)",

The most valued people, in my opinion, are those that can be thrown a problem and can just “figure it out.” That means dealing with not well-defined problems, giving things a few solid attempts before asking help from others (this can be a balance, especially when you’re just starting out), and being as autonomous as possible. Also I’m glad that chat GPT wasn’t around when I first started. Try not to let it do too much, treat it like a better google and use it to understand why things work",

You've got the problem solving skills down which honestly matters more than most people think :DFew things that'll serve you well though:First day, don't overthink it. Be curious, ask questions about the codebase, understand the product you're building. Most people forget new devs need context on why they're building something, not just what.The \"work your ass off\" mentality is good but be smart about it. Focus on delivering quality over quantity. I'd rather have someone ship one solid feature than rush through three buggy ones. Oof, and the biggest pitfall? Not asking for help when you're stuck. Senior devs expect you to get stuck, they just want to see you've tried to figure it out first. Give yourself 30-45 mins on a problem, then ask.Also, document everything you learn about their systems. You'll thank yourself later and it shows you're thinking beyond just your immediate tasks.Research background is actually an advantage in startups. You know how to dig deep into problems and you're used to figuring things out independently. That's valuable.One last thing. build relationships with your teammates. Grab coffee, understand what they're working on. Technical skills get you hired but relationships help you grow.You got this :)",

I have an informal \"30 minute\" rule for our interns. If you're stuck on something, spend 30 minutes trying to figure it out on your own. If you solve one problem that leads to a new one, reset the clock. If you've made zero progress for 30 minutes then you can ask for help. This has two benefits:1. it forces you to be self-reliant and sharpen your \"figure it out\" skills which are incredibly important in this industry2. it prevents you from wasting an entire day on a problem someone knows the answer to in 30 secondsStart there.",

Also, try to network. UCSD has a lot of students that will be going to big firms come this summer, and many of them will get full time offers. Being friends with those people will help a ton.Finally, you do have an internship. That research internship is something you can present as evidence that you are employable.Finally, I would wonder why you haven't taken any courses on things like OS, compilers, databases, etc. You know, core CS stuff. That might be something an employer might wonder too, why all your coursework is solely focused on Ai and ML. As for the job search, I'm left wondering how exactly you went about that. Like, did you spend a lot of your time on LinkedIn? Handshake? In person recruiting events? Direct company applications? Indeed? There is some statistical evidence suggesting that some of these lead to jobs at higher rates than others(LinkedIn sucks for this, while Handshake and in person are a lot better).",

You don't always need to be working on stuff, sometimes it's good to talk with others and better understand what others are doing and how the business works. I regularly reach out to people, even people I have never met in person. It has worked out well and management really likes it as well since it gives their projects more visibility.**Short answer to your original question**: a recruiter reached out for a job below my skillset which accidentally lead me to getting an internal promotion to a software engineer, which wasn't my initial intended career path, but I am so glad I kept an open mind when taking the initial job",

Networking remotely isn't that different from networking face to face, you're really just building relationships with folks. Its sure easier to build relationships in person though, so there's that aspect working against you if you're 100% remote.",

I would go 2-3 per position, and really focus on the main accomplishments. Also, don't exceed two lines per point.Second, try to be a bit more specific. For example, describe what the ETL pipeline did and what your contributions to it were. Focus on the impact you made and how you made it, rather than just listing technologies or describing the task.Third, I would also chill out a bit on the keyword stuffing. While you do have to massage a couple keywords into your bullet points, it should feel natural and not excessive. The skills sections is usually the better place for keyword stuffing technologies, whereas the bullet points are better for keyword stuffing higher-level concepts. Excessive keyword stuffing might get you through ATS more often, but it also will turn off humans. Try to strike a balance.Lastly, I skilled a summary altogether. I hear mixed things about them online, but I've found that dropping it improves the focus of my resume.My current resume is <400 words. In my opinion, with such high application volume, it's critical for a resume to be short and to the point. Taking away unnecessary wordiness and corporate speak makes your resume more concise and more authentic.",

Highlight relevant metrics early — if you improved uptime, reduced latency, fixed X bugs, share that up front in your summary/experience to catch attention.2. Focus on SRE/Full‑Stack wins — if you automated builds, improved CI/CD, or built backend services, list those first with details like languages, tools, outcomes.3. Tailor per location or industry — Austin vs. Raleigh vs. non-tech differs. Add a one-liner like “open to on-site roles in Austin or Raleigh” — helps with local filters.4. Consider adding a short “SRE/DevOps projects” section — even if small or self-led, that shows recent hands-on work and keeps ATS engaged.5. Update your summary to show recent progress: *“2 yrs backend/SRE experience; laid off recently but now focusing full-time on improving resilience through independent automation projects.”*You’re close — your core experience is solid. Want help tightening your summary or building a quick skim‑ready project entry? Feel free to DM — happy to help polish it for those market spots.",

They all would fly in Sunday night or Monday morning, then back on Thursday night, WFH on Friday. They each had a cheap place to stay by renting a friend's guest room/couch, or rented out a micro apartment.Still, it was very rough on them and their families. It's not so much about the monetary cost. You can maybe even save money in many cases, even after all the flight costs. It mainly comes at the cost of your time and time with your family.",

If the subject is making you go 'meh' in the first year, then it's hard to say what'll make you go from meh to 'wow yes' in future years.When I took CS, I was super engrossed and enamored by my classes. While not every student will be quite like it, you probably need more than \"I've grown disinterested\". My guess is your use of the online tools let you squeek by without understanding the material, which has done you a massive disservice.This degree isn't for everyone.

Regardless of what path you go down, I feel like I should also add that a Political Science degree isn’t worth much if you don’t plan on going to law school. You can absolutely find work with it or a History degree, but it’s not gonna pay as well as CS related jobs would.

Have you escalated to your manager about the lack of access needed to do your job? Have you escalated about the unacceptable behavior that your lead did when they got back along with the failure of you potentially not have full access to dashboards and other information you should have access too?this is not a hard-skill issue it is a workplace management issue that needs to be addressed by your management.In terms of skills there are too many to list, I will also note many of the things that are classic DevOps are being automated or will be mostly automated so you will need to upgrade your skillsets to take advantage of the technology evolution that is occurring so you will be most marketable.The enhancement of your hands-on skills are great, but mainly only useful if you are still physically hands on with servers, switches, etc. if you like doing that do not let your hands on skills degrade due to non-use. For your virtual/physical setups be sure you still have a good foundation on Linux, Windows, and MacOS to be most marketable globally.Learn of all the different cloud providers capabilities pros/cons for AWS, Azure, GCP and start building in the cloud to include dashboards, building metrics, building automated workflows, etc. and see if you can upgrade your skills to the point to where you can move on to a new job. Make sure you are also continuing to train using official and non-official high quality sources to keep your hard skills sharp. If you are not networking outside of people you know at work you are doing a disservice, get out there and expand your network. That way you can reach out to people you actually know to land opportunities.",

        "body": "I really appreciate you taking the time.Regarding the team dynamics, I’ll just say it reflects a common cultural issue in environments like mine. Knowledge tends to be closely guarded rather than shared, and that limits opportunities for others to grow. I’ve tried to stay respectful and focus on what I can control. When I escalated, I was promised more structured handovers and collaboration, but so far that hasn’t materialized. I continue to show up, do my part, and document everything when needed. The meeting is scheduled on my calendar and nobody shows up. My predecessor told me that this guy is the nephew of ceo and hard to work with. OTOH my project manager and Dev Lead are helpful. I’m grateful for that. I’ve been learning independently and had only a 10-day KT session with my predecessor. Since then, I’ve been handling responsibilities without ongoing guidance. While it’s not ideal, I’ve accepted the reality and adjusted my expectations. I’m committed to growth, and that’s where I’m placing my energy.Right now, my first priority is delivering on my current job responsibilities. After that, I’m preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. I’ve also started work on a side project that combines AWS with SageMaker, with a focus on practical applications of agentic AI. Progress has been slower than I’d like, partly because I’m doing it solo and don’t have a mentor to bounce ideas off. Still, it’s helping me apply what I’m learning in a more real-world context.As for networking, I’ve been reaching out on LinkedIn and other platforms, but I’ve found that 9 out of 10 people simply don’t respond. I’ve also been trying to attend virtual and local seminars via Meetup.com. Unfortunately, events are quite limited in my country, but I don’t see that as a blocker. I’m not giving up. I know someone out there is looking for someone with drive and a willingness to learn. I just need to be in the right place at the right time.Your advice on staying sharp with hands-on skills, understanding cloud deeply, and constantly training through official and high-quality sources is spot-on. I’m applying it as best as I can and will continue pushing forward.Thanks again for your guidance. If you have any suggestions on communities that are actually responsive or mentorship opportunities worth exploring, I’d be grateful to hear them.",

If you’re ok with that go for it, but fully understand that this is a Product/Business role, not an R&D one and that’s what you’re slotting yourself as for good.OP- it is painfully obvious from these comments none of these people know what a BA is. BA-SWE is not a traditional path and you are never making a jump like that anywhere outside of a very small company.

I did keep applying to dev jobs in the meantime, but those applications continued to go nowhere, and I eventually got hired in one of the non-dev, non-IT, non-anything-tech-related jobs.This is compared to mid-2022, when I got offers from multiple companies, with zero experience other than a bootcamp and some web projects, including one offer for an *Intermediate* dev role because the bar was so low and they were so desperate to find devs to hire.So, I didn't give up on getting a non-retail role, I just accepted the first white-collar role that actually, finally, made me an offer again, and it happened not to be a dev job.",

I have metrics to back up most of my claims, and I write around 3 paragraphs for each section pointing to concrete details backing up my justification for the scores I've given myself.Every year my boss has agreed with my scores for each category or rated me higher than I rated myself.You need to make it easy for the person doing your review to justify giving you the score. The less they need to critically think about the grading criteria the better in my opinion. You need to advocate for yourself, in all facets of life, because it is very unlikely that others will do it for you.If you haven't done so, start keeping track of accomplishments throughout the year which you can point to as justifications for your rating. Even if they're small.I've even at times flat out said in my comments that I perhaps don't fully deserve the rating of 5, but since I felt I was on the cusp, I gave myself the nod because I need to advocate for myself. Be assertive but fair.Not all of this may apply to you if you truly feel that you are just middle of the road average, but you should still be your own best advocate.",

It doesn't mean that if you force yourself to present, one day all your anxiety and stage fright magically goes away and suddenly you're a pro presenter.It means that the more you do it, the easier that anxiety becomes to manage, and the less it impacts your ability to present. The anxiety's still there. It'll probably *always* be there. You're not going to \"get over\" it. But you will absolutely become better at managing it.I also hate presenting. I've always been uncomfortable with it. In college, and early in my career, the anxiety would really get to me. The anxiety would hit me so hard I can feel my voice straight up changing, dry mouth, stuttering, stumbling over my words, rushing, I start sweating, if it's bad enough I'll be shaking like a leaf.With years and years of on-the-job practice in the *professional* world, that anxiety slowly became more and more manageable. I think maybe 4 or 5 years into my career is when it became so manageable I started considering myself a *good* presenter.For example, not long after I started at my current job, I got the chance to present a demo of a new feature to all of our stakeholders. It was a very not-casual call with 50+ people on it. I crushed it, I spoke slowly and clearly, I communicated my points well, it went great. I got multiple comments, and even a formal email to my manager, mentioning how great of a demo was, specifically calling out how well I presented it.The anxiety was absolutely still there. Tons of it. Leading up to, during, and afterwards. But, at this point in my career, I can manage it to a point where it doesn't impact my ability to do an amazing presentation, it's not showing through my voice, or stuttering, or shaking anymore. I'm able to keep it mostly internal. Everything that goes into presentations today are very much leaned behaviors that come from practice.Presenting is going to be a very important part of your career. It gets even more important as you gain seniority, you're not going to be able to pawn that responsibility off for your whole career. Do the presentation. Keep doing them. It will get better.

Mid-demo the box froze. Without missing a beat, the demo guy, a 5.5 ft tall Indian version of Tom Cruise with similar steel nerves, pulls out the USB drive, inserts to the box debug port as the unit is rebooting, reprograms the unit in front of the CEO all while explaining that the unit is field upgradeable via USB. Unit reboots as expected and demo is great. The guy is now VP engineering for a major tech firm. You don't need to be able to do that but an internal demo should be easy enough to start.",

Limiting your job search to a single area, especially in a bad market, makes the search significantly more difficult and time consuming.What's your plan if you can't line anything up for several months, or even a year? What if the only jobs you can find are ones that would require you to relocate a 2nd time to somewhere like Austin, or Detroit?If I were you, and I wanted to relocate to the Bay Area, I'd line up a job there *first*, and then move once I have one lined up. That's exactly what I did in my current city actually. My new grad job was in the Midwest, which was fine, but I always wanted to move back to the east coast. So once I had a few years experience under my belt, I started job searching in the city I wanted to move in, and then when I had something lined up, I relocated. I can't imagine quitting my job and moving to a very expensive city unemployed. In fact I probably wouldn't have even been approved for my apartment if I didn't have a job, they asked for my offer letter as proof of income.That said, what's your goal behind relocating? Do you *want* to live in the Bay Area? Or are you just looking for a hybrid/on-site job? If the latter, you can find those all over the US, there's a lot more places than just the Bay Area. You should be searching country-wide if that's the case, your job search will be way easier if you can lift the geographic restriction.",

If you think you will struggle to become motivated to succeed in school after the gap, then maybe it isn't a good idea.> I got pretty deep into math and cs competitions, and I feel like I would forgot most of what I’ve learned after the gap yearI was once told by a professor of mine that learning something is not about retaining that knowledge, but how quickly you can *re-learn* it. Everybody forgets over time, but if you know something, it will come back to you quickly after being exposed to it again. That rings true, in my experience. If you feel confident now, you'll be fine later. You'll be taking university classes, not doing calculations for the moon landing. There is plenty of time to ramp back up in first-year courses.> I’m kind of afraid that this would ruin my careerIt absolutely, and I cannot stress this enough, *will not*. I know more kids who burned out after college from the endless grind throughout their whole student life than I do those who \"ruined their career\" before it even began. I actually don't know any of the latter, but a lot of the former.> Some people also told me that I can take a gap year anytime, so I should spend my most meaningful years at school with friends.I can get behind the friends part, but both a gap year and going to school with your friends are very valuable things to spend your \"meaningful years\" on, though I disagree that meaningful years as as limited as that sentiment implies. Also, you'll make a ton of new friends at university, and being a year older won't change much there. 5-10 years, maybe, but you're still a peer to everybody after only 1 year away. That opportunity won't change.Taking your gap year *after* university is way more likely to effect your career, however. You'll hopefully make some connections at school, and having those connections be fresh as you look for jobs is a big deal. Applying to jobs or grad school while you're in your last year is much easier, especially if you're interning somewhere that may want to hire you.This is absolutely the *best* time to take a gap year, but if you do take it you should know what you want from it, even if that is just time away from the stress of the student grind.",

Funny enough, I could not remember the keyword name at that moment but knew there was functionality for it. The OFFSET keyword. (While also using LIMIT)I chose these keywords because for the most part we rely heavily on the Django ORM at my company, and so when I’m writing queries it’s mostly to find data to try and replicate issues. These keywords were the ones I found myself using most frequently.Moving forward I plan on showing them queries with these keywords in them and asking them to explain to me what it’s doing, since the ability to understand an SQL query is a lot more valuable than rote memorization of keywords.",

They went through my gh and asked me technical details about my portfolio app (django psql tailwind docker etc.) I think I have answered their questions flawlessly allthough these questions were simple for example;Q: Where and how did you deploy the app, did you have to deploy db and the app separately?A: I deployed on render, took great care to use as many environmental variables in settings.py, exported them to the cloud service, then i set up another service for postgre db, connected them together and deployed with gunicorn, allthough it was about 3 weeks ago, right now I would automate the process using a docker-compose.yml file, by setting up two services web and db and configuring the environmental variables there.There were some other basic questions, they didnt really follow up that much, also gave me a lot of time to speak and later on ask questions about the company, we scheduled a 30 minute screening and it took about 45-50, so to me it seems like I did decently, I dont think they would let me spend like 20 minutes asking them questions about the company if they didnt consider me as a potential candidate",

There is a very strong chance that the exact role has not been open for eight months and that the company has simply been hiring engineers with a similar profile for an extended period of time. In recruiting this is often referred to as a \"pipeline\" posting or approach. I've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \\----**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:** Regarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. **Interview Process:** Having an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. **Recommended Approach:**Rather than trying to frame things as \"this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me\" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",

Also, moving away from friends and family is hard but the great thing about your hometown is that it will always be there. Go have a new experience in a cool city, learn and if you hate it, look for a remote job in 2 years and move back. as you get older, it gets much much harder to move away so doing it while you’re young and unattached from major responsibility is the perfect time.",

Be kinder to yourself. Also at your experience level you will start to notice a lot of ageism where companies prefer fresh graduates than you, and those fresh graduates prefer working with other fresh graduates than you, even though it makes no sense on any level given your skills and experience. Often it is actually down to the age of the person managing you and whether they feel intimidated by you or not.Offshoring is the main threat though, plus the amount of competition with all the overqualified laid off people looking for work.FYI: I am in the process of transitioning to Cyber Security - hoping to land security reseacher/appsec/security engineer roles after 20 years in SDE/SDET/Devops roles.",

I'm also in a medium COL city, so $220k goes a very, very long way here.For me, with that starting point... a $20k cut isn't that big of a deal. And in terms of resume, those 16 years will be big on your resume still for a while. It's still technical work. Take the job.From a career point of view, I don't know what's best from some logical sense - say, in terms of maximizing lifetime earnings. That's impossible to say. But, you're saying it's a switch you want to make. And frankly, when I was last searching for a SWE gig, positions with budgets over $200k were few and far between - especially for someone newer to the role.",

If you have bandwidth for more work, you just need to communicate that.Even if you're on one of those teams that's hyper-focused on keeping sprints set in stone where they refuse to pull in work from the backlog in the middle of the sprint, or if your teams tickets are support-based, you can pivot the conversation with your manager into asking exactly what you're asking us. \"How should I best use my downtime?\".There could be POC's your manager thinks you should experiment with, maybe moonlight on another team and help them out for a portion of your time, maybe help take the load off your fellow devs, maybe experiment and dabble in tangential roles, maybe a million other things.If your manager actually responds to this conversation with \"Sit and twiddle your thumbs\", or \"I don't know, do whatever you want\", that's a bad manager.

AI will definitely change things long-term, but perhaps less so that some enthusiasts think.Personally, I think that software engineering is one of the most difficult white-collar jobs to rationalize away. Many of the layoffs we've seen over the last years are better explained as a correction for pandemic-era overhiring and as adjustment to turbulent markets – but saying you're doubling down on AI productivity sounds better for investors. I see strong parallels to ideas like offshoring.Whatever happens, human problem solving skills will remain valuable. Human software engineering skills will remain valuable, though the bar of what is hireable might become higher (and note that these skills cannot be acquired via vibe-coding). If AI coding agents turn out to be useful in the long-term, then security, QA, code review, and refactoring skills will become increasingly important.",

The issue is, that women/whatever you’re into really don’t look for that, it’s actually more of a turn on to just be financially stable and emotionally available. So your choice is :1) Cokehead banging hookers who don’t care about you, and having everyone you love look at you as a cokehead. Work at a FAANG and develop an anxiety disorder, and then die early and stressed.2) Live within your means, be stable, be a good and relaxing person to be around, bang a hot chick who loves you, have people in general love you.

We also don't have many hard deadlines unless we need to meet new legal standards. This means there's no pressure when it comes to using our (rather generous) PTO and that time actually gets deducted from our expected work output. I literally never work more than 40hrs per week unless I choose to crunch something for my own peace of mind. I only go to the office two days a week.If you're willing to take a pay cut, I'd look for smaller companies like this. The salary isn't super competitive, but the rest of our benefits are great, the culture is super relaxed, and the WLB is on point.Granted, this is only my second job, and it's my first job in tech.

Some of those 13 YoE might be very good at politics but they seem awfully unprepared to work at tech firms (there was a 24 YoE from banking who didn't even know what LRU cache was. It's that bad).Let alone most traditional firms ... don't really have scale problems. It's really just basic CRUD on a relational database like postgres. I guess some use mongodb because there was a 'mongodb' hype at one point but .... the usage most of times is just completely inappropriate (and was mostly done because engineers wanted to 'use the latest fad').Think about it. Say you worked for 25 years at Berkshire Hathaway as some technical person. Well... this is the webpage today: [https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/)I would guess juniors at tech firms would be far more up to date in technical skills.

Limited learning, backto back layoffs, product that isn't viable... even with job security till Q1/Q2 2026, that's not exactly inspiring. Plus being siloed into just applied AI work when you could be learning MLOps and data engineering, that's valuable stuff.The founding ML engineer role sounds legit too. CEO with previous founder experience, both him and CTO are seasoned with relevant background. That matters way more than people think.Also can you negotiate the equity up to 1% ? At pre seed that's not unreasonable for a founding engineerHonestly the fact that you're even considering it tells me you're probably already leaning towards the startup. Your gut is usually right about these things.One thing tho. Make sure you understand the vesting schedule and what happens to your equity if they don't raise that seed round.

Honestly, I have no preference. I'm just looking to get any big name on my resume to open doors and compensate for my no-name college.
