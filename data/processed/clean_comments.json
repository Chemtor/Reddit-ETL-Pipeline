While that’s certainly true at many large companies like Meta or Amazon where you’re basically slinging SQL and little else, it’s most certainly not true at companies like Capital One or Airbnb or Netflix; there, your job is practically 1:1 with software engineering. That being said, a great percentage of DE’s need to study DSA, time/memory complexity, and CS fundamentals, instead of memorizing frameworks and assuming everything’s Gucci. It’s the fundamentals that evidently are the “hard stuff”.To provide an actual metric that illustrates what I mean: at a company I will not name, I encountered a legacy process that took 55 hours but was reduced to 6.5 seconds, as well as ~5x less memory allocation, simply by using Aho-Corasick instead of regex, parallelization instead of serialization, and basic optimizations using concepts like “tidy data” and sets. That’s the difference between throwing SQL at everything and knowing when certain tools and techniques apply best or worst.",

You often need to ensure your pipelines will work (or at least fail gracefully) with bad data and not hang with huge amounts of data.You also have to deal with external APIs or flat file transfers where your assumptions will be based on the documentation the external party provides. You quickly come to realise this documentation is often old or just plain incorrect so building a test suite on it is a lesson on futility.This is obviously much harder to do than writing unit tests of your own code and when the pressures mount of delivering integrations and new data products to the business mount, testing can often fall by the wayside with data engineers falling back on \"we'll test it in live!\".This, compounded by the fact that setting up a testing environment that truly represents your production database/data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming all combine to mean tests are a much less rigourously followed discipline in data engineering.Does that mean you should skip them altogether? Absolutely not, but ensuring you have 100% unit test code coverage is not nearly as valuable as ensuring a complex pipeline has a decent set of integration and stress tests for, say, 75% of its functionality.The reality is that most data engineers will be lucky to get anywhere near that, which is almost certainly why they were impressed you wrote tests at all. It should mean that you approach the challenges above with the right mindset, rather than just avoiding them because testing is hard on data engineering.",

Source database keep changing their entities and fields, so that we ```SELECT``` from the wrong columns,2. Data that we expect… are more mendacious than we anticipated.3. Sometimes, data is forbidden from us because these data are personally-identifiable information and we have to first deploy our ETL pipelines first, so that our business users/customers verify that our SQL statements are correct and generate the right output.Unit tests are largely useful if you want to enforce a culture of \"make sure you cover your asses first.\" In a large corporate or public sector environment, however, we exploit gaps in either technical or structural (i.e. \"the data is not cleansed properly\") situations to push back effort.Is this bad? Absolutely. Companies and public sectors, however, care not about holistic software development (remember how **hard** it is to employ *zero trust model* as a way to develop our software, let alone ETL pipelines?).",

Simple enough. He couldn’t get it to work. Found out he used Gemini to generate the code…which was riddled with errors. The intern showed a poor understanding of the assignment and an absolute reliance on AI.Another example: we get CSV dumps from financial organizations daily. One of the orgs had changed their CSV specs without informing us. It broke our pipeline, which led to garbage data being loaded, which led to dashboards being broken. Fixing this problem required long conversations with that org, their techs, our DBA, our DevOps. We had to manually reload the files before the breakage, update our ETL code, update our Snowflake table and our dashboards. How would AI have helped here?IMO AI shows potential in software development itself. But the tools themselves (GH’s copilot, Google Gemini, ChatGPT) are still in their infancy.",

There's not really a ton of time saved with actual code generation for me, since most of the time spent is spent on actually understanding the data and business needs. Writing code that does what I want is usually the easy part, the hard part is knowing if what I want is what I need.All that said, we are investigating many different models for various content generation/fact checking/data quality checking purposes and it seems relatively promising.

Ideally you also have tests that can be run before you deploy into a test/integration environment, and more tests that you can run before you merge your code to the main branch.Tests should be done as early as is reasonably possible, to detect errors and issues as soon as possible, so that people waste as little time as possible creating and then hunting down and fixing defects.These tests are built on certain assumptions, positive or negative, then 'Given [x] When [y] Then [z]'. DQ checks are there to catch when your assumptions on 'given' and 'when' don't hold -- something gave you nulls when it shouldn't, or some new code value came in for a column that didn't exist before, or some formatted number had a format change. You can't check the output for various features to detect if something went horribly wrong, and you can halt the process or quarantine some data so that it doesn't corrupt everything.But those DQ processes should themselves be tested. Do they correctly identify certain scenarios and actually halt the process (or do whatever other mitigating action you specify). Otherwise, where's the confidence that they actually work?",

        "body": "I feel like I’m being called to respond here. I remember you commenting something similar under one of my posts. I was planning to write a separate post to address it, but since you brought it up here first, here I am :)We really should make a clear distinction between testing **imperative code** (like Python, Java, etc.) and **declarative code** (like SQL). There are some similarities, sure, but the overall intuition is quite different.Procedural code is much more detailed — it’s built to operate on small units of data or small transactions. You can stop execution at any point, inspect variables, and debug step by step. You have full control over dependencies, can inject mocks, and create true unit tests (It is all very well described by many books and authors).That’s basically impossible in SQL-driven projects (which is what I’m talking about in my posts). Here tests are essentially black-box tests you're testing the outcome of a whole query or pipeline as it runs through the SQL engine. There’s no pausing mid-query or stepping through line by line.Here’s how I see the distinction in SQL-driven projects:* **Data tests** — I treat these as part of the models itself. Like you said, they run at runtime. I think of them as *assertions* that validate whether the model can handle certain inputs.In imperative code, it would look something like this: def foo(request): if request is None: raise Exception(\"Request cannot be null\") if not is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request): raise Exception(\"Request is not valid in this context because of X, Y, Z\") do_actual_processing(request)The actual processing code is only meant to work with data that’s already been validated. If the data doesn’t meet the criteria, we terminate early and skip that specific request.In SQL-based projects, I see data tests playing the same role. The simple, built-in tests are kind of like basic assertions like `request is None`. More specific, custom tests are closer to the business logic checks, like `is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request)`.The difference is that we place the test on a previous model in relation to the one we're currently building, and we run it against the entire dataset — not just a single piece of data. Unfortunately, if it fails, it can bring down the whole build, unlike in transactional systems where only one transaction would fail.* **Unit tests** \\- These focus on verifying logic rather than the data itself. The goal is to ensure that a specific block of logic behaves as expected. Support for writing this kind of test is limited (it’s available in dbt, but I don’t find it particularly easy to use). Still, it can be useful for checking that complex conditional logic works correctly or that your regex patterns aren’t doing anything weird.* **Diff tests** – These run the whole pipeline with your new changes and compare how the exposures or main models differ between the old and new versions of the code. It’s kind of like an integration test. It’s especially useful for explaining to data consumers what changed and why those changes happened.These are all the automated tests I use in analytical projects, and so far, this testing setup has been sufficient for all my needs.So, in summary, I agree with the distinction you made. I think about data test in specific way, I am aware that this is a run time concept and use it there.",

It could be directly from a source system, from a curated lake are, data model, or a cleansed area. The idea is to drive a feedback loop to upstream and downstream systems by engaging data stewards to enact process, behaviour or policy change to drive long term improvements in quality. Sometimes it may be possible to directly integrate with these systems to automatically enact change/fixes, but this should always be done with a person to approve. The point is, what you describe are two different concepts entirely, and are not comparable in any way. There is absolutely zero overlap and it is not something based against data flowing, it is most likely never to interact with the layers an engineer will likely touch.",

My team DE's use DBT heavily for the data pipeline work, without data models, they cannot build proper structured pipelines. Data Models are the foundations for any OLTP and OLAP systems, they are systems, tools and applications agnostics. Few tweaks here and there but for most part, a strong base model can be plugged into any application. Data Vault has got more popularity in Europe than in North America, but it'll take sometime for companies to adopt it. I sometimes feel that the art of data modeling is a long forgotten skill. My team tech lead comes from traditional ETL background and has done lot of modeling in his past. I still spend lot of time on the model naming conventions and establishing proper standards. Every field when read the first time should for most part convey a business meaning, inform users of what type of data it might be storing rather than guessing games.",

Data engineers often work within a data platorm or framework, so I am not sure what is being built where an integration test would be useful beyond valdiating results in a Dev and/or UAT environment.

Then you have to figure out how you’re going to get your test cases hooked up in there. Tools like dbt and sqlmesh don’t feel like they scale all that well imo, and it’s odd to store database tables to test as yaml.Plus some more head scratchers about how you’re going to make ephemeral and idempotent tests, and separate environments.

In my experience (mostly feeding business/analytics reports) having good tests for business logic is more useful than technical testing (like is this column nullable or unique, etc) because I'm trying to minimize scenarios where the data pipelines succeed but the numbers make no sense to business people and then the business complains or stops trusting the numbers. And I find a decent amount of issues with technical data quality will be noticeable immediately, like if you try to upsert with a duplicate PK, the pipeline will fail and you'll get a notification. It seems like you have the perspective of a DE working in a tech minded company where tech/software is the product, so it makes sense to have the highest possible software quality. This is not the case for all non software companies, where having old and shitty software is the norm and asking for budget increases gets you laughed out of the room. This culture filters down into who gets hired and what tools get used, so the business ends up with worse quality engineering talent all else equal. Sometimes that blows up in the business's face, other times nothing bad happens for years. Those DEs probably aren't going to write tests because they don't see the benefits, are too lazy, are overworked, or don't have the budget (or some other excuse). idk if that answers your question but i think it describes reality a bit better than the strawman arguments the earlier commenters provided",

        "body": "I've been working on (and failing at, honestly) getting data engineers to adopt proper testing practices for ten years. Here's what I've observed:1.     **Legacy Systems and Technical Debt** Many organizations are stuck with legacy data architectures - monolithic data warehouses, batch ETL processes built years ago - that are incredibly difficult to modernize. The technical debt from years of ad hoc development makes implementing proper testing and observability feel like trying to retrofit a Formula 1 engine into a horse-drawn carriage. Migrating to modern cloud-native stacks requires significant investment that many companies aren't willing to make.2.     **Lack of Data Engineering Maturity** This is the big one. Most companies still treat data engineering as a back-office function rather than a core engineering discipline. You end up with a mess of one-off scripts, undocumented workflows, and manual interventions everywhere. Very few data teams practice basic software engineering principles like CI/CD, proper testing, or version control for their pipelines.3.     **Resistance to Cultural Change** Data teams have historically worked in silos - engineers, analysts, scientists, and business teams all doing their own thing. DataOps requires breaking down these silos and adopting agile methodologies, which is genuinely disruptive to existing workflows. Leadership has to drive this cultural shift, but most executives don't understand data engineering well enough to know what needs to change.  You need to test at every point on the data joureny4.     **Tooling Complexity & Vendor Overload** The data tooling landscape is overwhelming. Every vendor promises to solve all your problems, but integrating everything into a coherent, testable system is a nightmare.5.     **Lack of Automated Testing & Observability** This is where we really fail compared to software engineering. Data teams still rely on manual SQL checks instead of automated data quality pipelines. We have open source tools now - Great Expectations, , dbt tests, and my company's DataOps Data Quality TestGen - but adoption is still painfully slow.6.     **The Meaning of \"Testing\" is Confusing** This one drives me crazy. When software engineers talk about testing, they mean unit tests, integration tests, etc. that run during development and deployment. But in data engineering, \"testing\" could mean: Testing your code logic during development (like software engineers do), Testing data quality when new data arrives in production, Testing data at various points in the produict process.7.     **Do you test in development when code changes, or in production when data changes? The answer is YES to both**, but most teams don't distinguish between these different types of testing. This confusion leads to either over-engineering development tests or completely ignoring runtime data quality checks. We need both static code testing AND dynamic data testing, but the industry hasn't standardized the terminology or tooling around this distinction.8.     **Regulatory & Compliance Challenges** Compliance requirements often prioritize audit trails over engineering best practices, creating friction around automation.9.     **Lack of Executive Buy-In & ROI Justification** It's hard to quantify the ROI of \"preventing data disasters that haven't happened yet.\" Executives see testing as overhead rather than insurance.The frustrating part is that we know how to solve these problems - the tools and methodologies exist. But changing organizational culture and overcoming years of technical debt is incredibly difficult. It's like trying to rebuild a plane while it's flying.",

People like the lake houses approach because they want all their data in one place instead of tabular in datamart and PDFs in lake because then it’s easier to combine them.The exception to all this is when you have HUGE tabular data. A datamart will be too slow because it’s not partitioned. Indexing helps but eventually it’s not enough.

Many of the systems that are older, but still very functional, are also very brittle. You don't change the file format just because you want to use a different format. You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these \"coming technologies\" is marketing BS. Know what huge financial institutions, like BoA, and huge retail, like Walmart, use? They are still using EDI. Yep, technologies from the 70s and 80s. Why? Because it works and they all trust it.

        "body": "I think the question is confusing a little unstructured data (image, video, etc.) and unprocessed structured data (raw JSON, raw CSV, etc.). My experience is on structured data, so I will be answering about this.In my understanding, the value proposition of the \"lake house\" as opposed to \"data lake + data warehouse\", is to reduce the amount of tools and data pipelines required to get your data from a raw state to a state that your end user can analyze.1. data lake + data warehouse (from Hadoop ~ 2007 then cloud ~ 2015): 1. ETL 1: Raw data is extracted/transformed/loaded (ETLed, or just dumped) into the data lake. 2. Storage 1: A data lake is optimized for massive low-cost storage (S3, GCS, Azure blob, MinIO). 3. ETL 2: Data lake data is cleaned, joined, aggregated etc. into a query-able state loaded in the data warehouse. 4. Storage 2: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical-oriented queries OLAP. It is generally an expensive independent black-box service with its own internal file storage so it requires additional data transfer (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift etc.).2. lake house (from Delta Lake ~ 2019): 1. ETL 1: Same as above. 2. Storage 1: Same as above. 3. ETL 2: Same as above, but you're not loading into a separate OLAP service, you stay in your object storage and just store in a different format, a lake house format. 4. Storage 2: A lake house (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Duck Lake) is optimized for OLAP queries, but it can be created in the same massive low-cost storage as Storage 1. It relies on additional table metadata that allows replicating some of the features and optimizations that make the previous OLAP services more performant than querying a basic partitioned Parquet table. For example, compared to Parquet only, it allows: 1. transactional changes (either successful or not at all), 1. schema evolution (adding new columns without rewriting the whole table), 1. time travel to previous versions, 1. upsert/delete/merge at the file level instead of the partition level, 1. and related read/write optimizations.> 1 - One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?So the key with Lake House tech is you can keep using your massive low-cost object storage for your OLAP layer as opposed to loading into an expensive OLAP black box. I have not detailed the generation before \"data lake + data warehouse\" (before Hadoop), which is mostly \"OLTP + data warehouse\", as you didn't ask about it.You can find more details in this article from Databricks who makes Delta Lake: https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf> 3 - Will these technologies become the de facto standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?Given their killer features above, I think so. But it can be a progressive evolution of your existing data lake, you don't have to trash it. Now, \"lake house\" warehouses are still distributed \"big data\" warehouses, which means they shine in processing huge amounts of data in a reasonable time and cost, and they do that better than partitioned Parquet tables. But this is still not as performant as PostgreSQL on average data, highly specialized OLAP databases like Click House or expensive black box OLAP like Snowflake. Although, Duck Lake may be bridging the gap for average data, with its metadata stored in OLTP instead of file, and its highly performant single process C++ engine.",

If everyone had well thought out plans, competent data governance, expert engineers in every tool under the sun, clear ownership, and clean data then most of us wouldn't have a job. I'd bet good money that you could take any given person that says they don't have what you're describing at their job, go to their workplace, and you'd find a bunch of random garbage in spreadsheets in the finance department, random junk getting imported into tables with \"tmp\" or \"stage\" in the name that have wormed their way into production processes, broken processes, and multiple people within the org using totally different definitions of the same thing but reporting the results to stakeholders. Anyone pretending otherwise is lying or too ignorant to know they're lying.",

If you've already got some hardware that you can use, you can do an extended test without putting down a credit card.* As you're pointing out, testing/CI/automation/etc. for existing Firebolt customers.* We're genuinely hoping to see people use this for real business use cases.

This means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. But achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. But, the myth of \"we will fix it in post\" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. Most analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the \"people pipeline\", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. But, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints. Bonus shortcut, just exclude all records that fail the test and magically your pipeline never fails. Business will think you're a rockstar! I strongly encourage KYD.",

Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong. **Regression testing** could be the most rewarding. The idea is simple: produce two versions of a table, before and after applying the changes. Then compare them record by record, see what doesn't match, and try to understand why.These two require the least investment from you yet bring immediate value.",

Unless your datasets are very deterministic or doesn’t change a lot I wouldn’t go there. Unless there’s an action do to on your end if you receive a new value.You can test for data continuity (try to find holes). That help a lot. Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common. For example at the moment you rely on s3 events, you’ve just lost your ordering. Can be interesting to build things in order but also to find missing data.And like you said, build test right (closer to your business domain tables), then shift left (closer to the source of data) anytime it’s possible. It’s usually easier to build a test that apply to a specific domain use case because you know what you want and expect. And it’s always better to test closer to the source.",

This means that you *should* still still write unit tests for the transformation layer.Comparison: a good Java developer *will* test (with a unit test) that a function called \"compute_total_price()\" will properly sum up all products currently in the basket - a good DE should do the same. This is not equal to \"testing SQL\", but ensures that the implementation really implements the contract.I see the \"no need to test your transformations as a DE\" argument very often and never understood it. Using unit tests for transformations makes any software engineer's work much easier, including us DEs.",

You are doing ELT by the sound of things: your python script extracts and loads the data, then your MySQL views transform it. Your MySQL DB is your data warehouse, by the sound of things. A simple one in relative terms, but simple is good so long as it meets your needs. Some orgs need a much more complex data warehouse.Apache Spark is probably what you're thinking of for Apache: it's a software system for using multiple computers to do a computational task, instead of being restricted to the hardware of just one computer. Many lower-spec computers can outperform and outprice one big one, for some workloads.BigQuery is one of Google's data tools - I think roughly like spark but I'm not super familiar with it.Data Factory probably refers to Microsoft's data tools: Azure Data Factory and its spiritual successor, Fabric Data Factory. These are components of wider data architecture in the Microsoft/Azure/Fabric ecosystem, for creating 'pipelines', which are just conceptual sequences of different tasks depending on one another. Pipelines typically have a code representation but are often also able to be visualised and edited via a GUI.ETA: I don't think you are at all new to data engineering, you just didn't realise you were doing it :slightly_smiling_face:",

The 3rd edition is the most recent, possibly the last (Kimball is firmly retired now IIRC), definitely the version to buy (substantial additions over 2nd edition) and still as relevant as 1996.

Of course you can do a lot of smart stuff; partitioning the data per day and such.

For one, and before AI generating code, they were mainly implemented to solve scalability problems that not every company will have. Why put everything in code? Why version control? Why CI/CD? Why SSoT for metrics / semantic layer? Etc etc. These are super hard to explain until you can demonstrate the consequences of not doing them. So naturally, people will lump them into the same boat as shiny new features designed to churn profit. Good thing is, with AI everyone is suddenly open to change if it helps them implement AI. Bad news is, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors (like reselling chatgpt or throwing AI at bad data) that will make it harder to convince people of change if/when it crashes.",

With 100k+ requests, you're probably looking for sub-second response times. However, even with lots of optimization, this isn't what Snowflake excels at.Regarding pricing: As you pay mainly for storage and warehouse uptime, there are no specific caveats. Regarding scaling, it would possibly make more sense to scale-out (more XS warehouses to serve requests in parallel). What we did is performing the transformations in Snowflake and export a denormalized table, and imported it into a Postgres. Which achieves <100 ms response times for 50+ attributes per record paginated with 100 records out of 1.5b records even on a very small configuration. However, within the last 12 months, a couple of things changed:1. Introduction of hybrid tables allowing Snowflake to perform better on OLTP tasks - we haven't tried this out yet as we are on Azure, and hybrid tables are on GA only on AWS2. Snowflake's recent aquisition of Crunchy Data and the announcement of Snowflake Postgres - we are waiting for news hereEDIT: Spelling & grammarEDIT 2: corrected Crunchy Data",

But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. Working outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. Don’t be too hard on yourself, brother. On the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. It might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. For example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. Another thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different. On the issue of passive-aggressiveness. I might be wrong on this one but have you spoken to your boss lately? Have you communicated your concerns? One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.In startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. Lastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do. If everything still fails, even if have communicated everything, then it might be the time to loom for another company, specially if it affects your mental health.",

Are there things not getting done or are they running a tight ship and get done by 3?It could also be asked if you take a lunch, or if you are only working 7 hours of the 8 you are in office.I'm not sure if I am reading your tone right, but I've seen more than one intern show up with some preconceived notions. As an intern, I'll let you know a few things for your career:1. You don't always see the effort others put in, and people who go down the road of attacking their superiors are almost always wrong, and usually get blacklisted or fired, so keep your head down and focus on your own work. Again, not sure if this is your tone, but the advice stands in case it's ever relevant.2. Get the idea of \"X hours worked\" out of your head now while you're hourly (Even though that is your whole world as an intern). You are all there to perform a service -- if that service is performed in 30 hours per week, then 10 hours is spent doing useless busywork to appear productive. But you'll have plenty of times when there's an emergency deadline and you're pulling 60 hours, that's what \"exempt\" (salary) means. You say you see them leave early, but did you see them crash on the couch in the lobby during the audit last year?3. There are no gold stars, rewards, raises, or bonuses for working harder/longer than contractually obligated. Especially at a company of 3,700 employees. And even more especially as a DE, your contributions will go with little more than a \"Thanks!\" if not completely unnoticed. The only time you will be \"seen\" is when something goes *wrong*, like a plumber or electrician.TLDR: Keep your head down, do your job, and hope that your future in DE is as \"relaxed\" as you seem to think it might be.",

You can use a mapping table as well for certain keywords/abbreviations (e.g. M.Sc/Mstrs/MA => Master's Degree) before running the fuzzy matching algorithm.",

Keep in mind you may need to split each word in to its own line, keeping track of the original string it came from with an id, then join it back up so the spelling corrector is applied on each word. You can also split each word in the degree in your master table out so you can keep joining based on relevant columns. Hope this helps",

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes. \\- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.The setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.The crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.If you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.The more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.Lastly, a few questions to keep in mind: \\- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system? \\- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues? \\- What is your tolerance level for false positives? \\- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?None of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else. But they are expensive, and there are mostly false positives.",

Assist or own data pipelines that prep data for dashboards using sql and or python.A Data engineer in general will do some of the following:Operate as a database administrator for a “data warehouse” to ensure the warehouse data is secure and queries are executing efficiently. Build data pipelines from data sources into the data warehouse. Be responsible for scheduling and deployment architecture for DAs pipelines. Productionalize pipelines that run against the data warehouse. This may be a dashboard pipeline, or could be a pipeline to generate an ML model, or a pipeline that translates data into a whole different data model that makes more sense for a group inside the company.",

But of course, you might have your reasons. Also, dbt only had community supporter SQL Server connectors, which can be fine, but if the community stops supporting it, you might fall behind on versions quickly (this happened for a while around the second half of 2023). Nothing of immediate concern, but something you may want to keep in mind.A while ago I had similar requirements but used Dagster on a VM for orchestration and hosting dbt (also storing data in blob storage), so I avoided Azure Data Factory and Azure Functions. I don't think this is a better or worse approach, but it's an alternative to reach a similar goal. I'm curious what people would recommend instead, but keep in mind my first sentences: if it's working, secure and cost acceptable, it's not shit.",

        "body": "Your architecture has a solid foundation, leveraging Azure's capabilities effectively. Using Azure Functions to handle different API endpoints is beneficial for scalability, while Azure Blob Storage serves as a flexible intermediary. However, consider integrating Azure Data Lake for more efficient data storage and retrieval, especially if data volume grows. Using dbt to manage transformations is great, as it provides modularity and enhanced version control, but ensure proper testing and documentation of SQL procedures to avoid potential pitfalls. Automating more aspects of your pipeline, like error handling and monitoring through Azure Monitor, could also improve robustness.Your pipeline design appears efficient, but here are some areas for improvement. Directly loading JSON into staging tables is fine, but you might want to explore the use of [Delta Lake](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/how-to-create-delta-live-tables-in-azure-databricks?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit) for its ACID transactional integrity and improved efficiency in handling large datasets. Additionally, you can enhance the scalability of your Azure Functions by moving them to Azure Kubernetes Service if your function apps face heavy workloads. Incorporating better data validation mechanisms before data transformation can save time troubleshooting downstream inaccuracies. Finally, enhancing your logging and monitoring setup, possibly integrating [Azure Log Analytics](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/building-data-pipelines-with-azure-synapse-analytics?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit), will provide better insights and faster response times to issues that may arise.",

When a schema change for column addition is needed, we make sure they're ok for us to add columns without changes on their end, and do so. Once that data is ready, they can make changes on their end to bring in the new column(s). Avoiding coordinated change windows is the key, because it causes immense difficulty when working across teams.If a column is being removed, we essentially do the reverse. Downstream removes their dependency on it, then we remove it. If this ever has to be inverted, then the new first-moving team needs to set up a view or some other 'dummy' mechanism to spoof the presence of the data, so that they can make their change now and let the other team catch up later.For ingestion we make use of lake storage -- we capture raw data and raw files, exactly as upstream provides them. We read the data as long as it is compatible, it does not have to be identical, but we do flag for changes in schema as they will need to be addressed. After read, we write to conformed tables that use a schema we set, so we can add in dummy data or drop columns as needed. Ideally upstream works with us and provides two copies when a change is happening, one in the old schema and another in the new, then we can switch over at any point (ie they are first mover in this scenario).",

A few common techniques I've seen work well across teams:\\- **Column add detection**: Regularly diffing source schemas against warehouse schemas and generating DDLs to add new columns automatically (or semi-automatically via approval workflows). \\- **Soft typing**: Especially for NoSQL sources, coercing all incoming values into strings or JSON blobs to prevent type errors when a field starts varying in type across records. \\- **Schema registry-backed ingestion:** For streaming systems like Kafka, using Avro or Protobuf with a schema registry to enforce compatibility at the producer level. \\- **Shadow tables for testing**: Syncing to a shadow dataset before applying schema changes to prod, so you can monitor how ingestion and downstream transforms behave.A lot of it comes down to how much control you have over upstream sources and how comfortable you are automating schema enforcement downstream.I work at [Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit), and one thing we do is automatically handle schema evolution in-flight—even inferring types for NoSQL sources and alerting teams when schema changes are detected. It's been interesting to see how much pain this saves folks once things scale.",

Such that for varchar columns, we have setup a column length if a column is varchar or if it’s a number, etc… This made development and data validation easier. In your case, you can go with the macro approach.Additonal approach is you can add a logic to the macro and will check if what is the average column lengths on all tables and have some margin, say 10%. Or… create a macro with 3 levels of lengths like short, medium, long. Each have equivalent lengths. What I could suggest, before doing any dev work, do some data profiling.In my previous project, we always do data profiling on the sources to check different metadata. One of those is the max length of columns of the source table. From there we set the desired length.",

This wasn’t a huge problem if the table was not joined, but it became a really big deal when trying to run joins and if there was redistribution across all nodes. They would totally gum up speed transferring data across the network, and you really felt it when you were handling millions of rows.It’s possible Amazon fixed this, but I doubt it. When I was there the most senior eng on that team did not understand why CTE’s at times took longer than temp tables.You should test this yourself with runtimes (turn off caching before doing so).",

You can pick optimization and DB internals along the road -- you don't get to read the source code of modern DWH plus you probably won't be able to read them anyway, and most of the optimization guides are just a few web pages so you only need to memorize and understand those. And since you are just ingesting data into DWH, most likely you don't need to write raw ingestion code -- and even if you do, it is going to be way smaller scale than Netflix.Basically the task falls into two parts:\\- Gathering requirements from stakeholders and make sure you clarify every question before moving into implementation stage. It's difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on the quality of the stakeholders, most of whom don't know what they want anyway.\\- Put up tests, alerts and monitoring into each pipeline.That's pretty much it. Apparently the people part is way more important and difficult than the technical part. It's essentially sort of BI analyst job.Oh and good luck on Fabric.",

SQL Server DBA here so I know exactly what you’re talking about :smirking_face: Well, not the DuckLake parts but the rest of it :smirking_face: Like where’s the equivalent of an SSDT project here?!Take a look at SQLMesh. It supports and/or replaces dbt. It has column type tracking / lineage between all of those databases and a few more!To summarise, you define a SQL model in SQLMesh (just a file with a select statement… model (name xxx); select blah from y), it works out what the source tables are by querying the source database, and caches them in a yaml file (it’s also a one command line to regenerate this at any time, so it’s no big deal at all, you can also easily parse it by hand or script because it’s so basic, literally just the table name column name and data type). Now for any more references to those tables or that model or other models and nested models etc it tracks the lineage downwards. If you have it materialize the views it calculates all the data types of the tables to create, or you can also manually define and override them, or keep the whole thing as just views.It has a VS Code extension that shows you all of the column types in your models while you’re coding, too. It has an API (of sorts) you can call to scrape it into other applications as well (but that part is a bit funny; because you need to run it in UI mode which opens a local 8080 port, and you query that… easier than it sounds).Anyway have a look just to see if it does what you want. One last thing though. F MAX column types in SQL Server :grinning_face_with_sweat: Those are LOB types so every single row query will cause an additional lookup for every LOB column in it. That quickly *kills* performance even in a data warehouse :grinning_face_with_sweat: Oh it’s okay for CSV files and stuff where you can’t be sure what the limits are… I get that part… but in general it’s a big no :grinning_face_with_sweat:",

The inability in dbt contracts of being able to do varchar(n) max length type checks - I come from a MS SQL server backgorund and am used to defining max field lengths for most text columns. This one is interesting though - I'm going to be using postgres for the database for the first time and I have just realised the strict varchar(n) types I'm useed to aren't really needed for the majority of columns because text / varchar data types will suffice - so it's less of a concern now. 2. I saw it as likely being a better debugging experience to pick up schema errors by tests (rather than using contracts which prevent the models from creating - although I get it that's what you'd want to happen). I'll also be creating other tests for expected values etc, so having all tests implemented the same way I saw as a cleaner apprach3. I just don't like the amount of yaml that gets created to implement schema checks via contracts (I think this is actually my biggest gripe). My first ingest pipeline has 30 files and some of them have 60+ columns - that is a lot of yaml needed not to mention dbt best practsies suggest putting it all in a single schema.yml file! That sounds a PITA for developers to maintain. Diffing metadata .schema changes in a small seed file is easy.",

Once you get in the later rounds you’ll need to know useful metrics and etl patterns but those come more naturally (at least they did for me). In almost all interviews you’ll need to write SQL and in many you’ll need to write python to solve small contained problems",

I chain the different calls as separate but dependent tasks in a single job in databricks, as the list of locations is input for the device list and the device list is input for the timeseries. I save the data from each task as files to blob storage and then ingest the data from these files to delta tables. If the calls were independent of each other I would let them run in parallel, depending on the compute resources I have access to. I would not use one script to loop through the api calls, it's more flexible to use the task/job orchestration and you get info about execution times, get notification about failures, etc. Hope this helps a bit",

That’s how I made the transition work pretty seamlessly. Obviously I spent lots of time outside of work learning on the side but here was the career path I took:Manufacturing engineer: I had a few roles before this that were more design focused and even though I hated manufacturing it was vital experience to get my foot in the door for the next step.Automation Engineer: worked and learned alongside controls engineers and IT networking experts to bring data from machines to databases for various use cases. Learned some PLC programming (don’t really use it now), a lot about networking and various data transfer protocols, and a lot of data modeling/reporting. I also got the chance to use some of my own data that I collected to mess around and try to build machine learning predictive maintenance models. The models didn’t perform well (for reasons outside my own control), but I learned a lot. I got much better at both SQL and Python and general problem solving.Data/Analytics Engineer: with all the experience I gained from my previous role I was able to make my way into a junior data role by taking a pay cut and just speaking really passionately about data (which I genuinely am). Since then I’ve learned a shit ton about good programming principles/procedures, working in a platform like Databricks, and how to communicate with business partners about data projects.I’ve since been promoted in this role and absolutely love the work that I do. I find it engaging and I continue to learn every day. If you have additional questions let me know but I hope this helps a bit.",

I would say their program is pretty good for introduction to DE, I respect their contribution to the community. However, there are so many details or problems you need to consider when you are working a real-life project, and some of them are extremely critical for interviews. The lack of depth in their course design (because it's only three months) means you need to take the initiatives to explore way more than they provide to you within the curriculum, which also stands if you enrolled an expensive bootcamp. I was asked a system design question during an interview to design a real-time pipeline, so get prepared for a decent resume, different problems or challenges you might encounter during a project, lots of SQL questions, Python programming questions (maybe not Leetcode style), and system design questions. P.S, in my opinion, sometimes I tend to ignore some people's advice like getting a CS degree or get a job in the data field first. I am not saying they're wrong, but their suggestions are based on their background and experience. It stands 10 years or 5 years ago, but nowadays even CS new grads are also struggling to get a job, some people became a DE because there were so many opportunities. I might offend many DE but this is my point view.",

        "body": "For most data teams, those analytically oriented, I think the high-level business expectations are for us to answer these questions:1. What happened?2. Why did it happen?3. What's going to happen next?4. What do we do about it?Luckily, those things build on each other and can help you prioritize your work. For example, first standing up simple reporting and over time growing that into predictions and recommendations. That last part is where a data team really shows its value.You can extend, or alternatively, start this thinking by considering who your data team's end users or customers are now and, just as important, who they'll be in the future. These are usually:1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?Once you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):1. What is the volume of the data?2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?For example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.If, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this. You can use this framework to anticipate the data you'll need to surface and to inform your understanding of how to organize it so that all the data relevant to a particular domain or user responsible for that data is co-located for their use.In the end, it all comes down to your unique needs, but those various points are some of the things I consider when building out a vision for what the data team should be building, how they should build it, and when.",

How are you going to model your data, how does that decision align with your self service ambitions. What does data governance look like, if it exists formally at all. What are you hiring? What skillsets are you looking to develop, how are you looking to code all of this? Maybe you're small and advanced so you can tackle python and spark as the workhorse for all of your work, or maybe you want to make things accessible to as many people as possible with a low entry point to contribution, and you choose SQL or a low-cost/graphical workflow.This is really just a few things to consider, and really a lot of it is bumping up against a tactical approach more than strategy, but hopefully it illustrates how a strategy of \"making data easily accessible to the organization\" has many different tendrils into various parts of the organization.",

When something goes wrong, it's challenging right now to even answer what this table looked like yesterday. I'm thinking right now of an observer service and an anomaly service at least and have it extensible for different source types (Snowflake, S3) and table types (raw source, transformed source, transformed model). Checks happen on a cron-friendly cadence but at least once a day. Maybe even configurable indepdently by source, path, table or check type. Is it opt-in or opt-out?Would love to hear more about how you are thinking about it! I'm just starting to formulate my thoughts about it. And before any vendors come at me, don't bother, you're barking up the wrong tree :).Edit: I should amend this to say that we have a LOT of dbt tests and we are very good about defining a unique key and testing on it (not null and unique) so we generally know about fan-out problems but I'm more thinking the silent failures. Something is null all of sudden or data volume drops off a cliff or there is a significant skew in the most frequent values in recent data, amounts skyrocketing due to math errors, etc. Logic has changed somewhere so how can you be very certain that the downstreams aren't silently negatively affected.",

One simple way to \"sync\" the two is to just make dev tables views pointing to prd tables.If you are doing streaming, Databricks has a few articles about that too.",

It helped because what would otherwise have been an individual topic only had a small trickle of records with occasional bursts -- not enough to justify running a separate streaming ingestion job for each, nor to handle the overhead of parquet+deltalake over individual row writes.So we bundled everything into one big stream with a wrapper around each event to indicate which type it was, which just helped with later processing.The advantage for us is we could run each downstream job on any schedule we wanted, all the data was there in the big ingestion table. Technically there is overhead with reading all the other data, but compared to reading directly off of kafka (or similar) it was still much faster to pull off lake storage.Another advantage was the sharing of overhead on the streaming size. Basically all the topics combined shared the same overhead or cluster oversizing, so while an individual 'topic' might burst to 10x traffic, since it only makes up 10% of the overall bandwidth, it would not shift performance demands too much. It kept usage reasonably predictable.Low latency use cases still ran off the original topics. The combined one was just for long term storage and batch processes.",

Then you avoid the overwrite and get tracking of adjustments that will support you if you ever want to make the case for fixing the problem at the source.

This is the Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Flink, Druid, NoSQL world. You would use these tools to complete projects such as real time data streaming, distributed computing, and moving petabytes of data around.Companies with a need to move massive amounts of data have use for this kind of data engineering: FAANG, Airbnb, Uber, and other companies that have serious needs to move petabytes of real time data and shit like that.The other side is BI and Analytics. This kind of data engineering can feature some code through use of APIs but nothing like the distributed computing Spark jobs and Kafka. Getting data for analytics is a lot more chill. Data doesn't have to be real time, maybe once a day or a week suffices. Stored procedures can reliably move large sets of data around. The skill set here is about analytics and SQL. No python, no system design, no fancy algorithm. It becomes more so a practice in how good you are at understanding the business, using that knowledge to analyze the data, and finally reporting on those connected dots with services like SSRS, Tableua, and Sigma, etc.Now, the HTML/CSS and Flask stuff is more like a back-end/full-stack Python engineering skill set. Throw in ReactJS for that front end your working and that's pretty much full-stack software development. I would try and figure out what you want to do first. Just remember: BI and Analytics data engineering is way different from the software engineering-esque data jobs.",

You'll eventually start seeing more calls and even offers then. Don't think this downwards trend will last that long. but it won't be over in a few months so reassess and do course correction accordingly.I also left my job as a ux designer to pivot into data because that field is more niche and many other reasons, now I'm just upskilling and planning to get certs then start applying, I expect a lot of the same experience as you are getting but no point worrying about what the future holds, keep doing what you're doing and find something else to sustain yourself in the meanwhile. I take freelance design projects to keep food on the table.More power to you bro",

The brutal truth is that after 5+ years of experience, companies expect you to not just solve problems but to think strategically about data architecture, communicate trade-offs clearly, and demonstrate leadership potential. You might be nailing the coding challenges but struggling with system design discussions or not articulating your thought process in a way that shows senior-level thinking. The gap since March isn't helping, but it's not insurmountable if you can identify what's happening in those final interviews.The good news is that reaching final rounds repeatedly means you're close, not failing. Companies are investing significant time in you, which signals genuine interest. Try getting feedback from those rejections, even if it's just a brief call with the recruiter. Practice explaining your architectural decisions out loud, prepare stories that showcase your impact beyond just technical execution, and consider doing mock interviews with other senior engineers who can spot what you might be missing. The market is competitive, but your background is strong enough to break through.I actually work on [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), which helps people navigate those tricky final-round questions where the stakes are highest and the answers need to demonstrate real depth of thinking.",

A tight scope (e.g., ingest Stripe to Snowflake, build dbt model, hand off docs) shows value fast and opens retainer work for monitoring and cost tuning. Keep a public repo with Terraform + CI that spins up Glue, dbt Cloud, and a cheap BI demo so prospects can click instead of imagine. Upwork and Toptal help fill gaps, but your outbound brings higher rates-start at 1.5× your last salaried hourly. Full-time remote roles exist too, mostly at cloud-born SaaS firms; filter on “US only” to avoid time-zone pain and pitch your infra-as-code chops. I bounced between Airbyte and Supabase, but DreamFactory is what I ended up adopting because it lets me wrap any legacy DB in a locked-down REST API without babysitting.

It's very hard to find entry level roles as a data engineer so it's usually better to start somewhere else and work your way in. Technical roles are probably still a better way than, say, your average data engineer who fell into analysis via finance and learned to be better at the technical stuff. Once you get there it's still one of the highest paid jobs in tech here, if you're good. There are a lot of people who have the title that aren't really data engineers. I regularly interview people who can't write `select * from table`. I spoke to someone in the same business as me today who is yet to convince his other three engineer colleagues that they should be using source control... so it can be maddening.",

A webpage stored locally that can only display information isn’t useful, so technologies were developed to solve these issues, which increased complexity. Honestly, an interesting simile to your observation would be, why do we need C/C++ if we could do everything in Assembly, which is the simplest language. An analog would be, why need a drill press when you have a drill. The reason why complexity exists, is because we have more complex problems.The tools and frameworks developers use that are “complex” actually have streamlined a lot of issues for us. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to process text if no one made “Stream” packages, or how annoying frontend webdev would be if frameworks like Vue.js and React didn’t exist?Just because something is complex, doesn’t mean it’s bad, but again, it becomes less complex when you get experience.",

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.You would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a \"bare metal\" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?Mobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do \"bad things\", you cannot do \"bare metal\" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different \"operating systems\", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.You will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it. Raw SDL is fine if what you're doing is fairly simple, a few UI elements there, a sprite there, but once you get beyond a certain level of complexity you'll either be wrapping it in your own engine, starting to use a framework yourself, or you \"muscle through\" it and create an unholy abomination that's a mess to work with.",

        "body": "I’m seeing weird answer here. The reason why a simple hello world is so difficult to get going dates back to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.Enter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.Now as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.This is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text elementI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",

Not only that, RAM cache is also very critical for performance, and hash tables are nearly always inferior to simple arrays when it comes to hitting cache. For performance there is also the idea of branching - in simple terms: whether or not the CPU can guess correctly if an if-statement will be true or false. Due to that you want as little if-statements as possible in performance critical areas, and i think all practical implementations of hash-tables have if-statements.2. Hash tables usually dont have order. If i want sorted data and often return the smallest/biggest member or a rank related to size, Hash tables are useless. Even simple strings have meaning to their order. EDIT: i dont think you can actually achieve order in hash-tables without a complementary list/array.3. You may need/want to use stack memory instead of heap memory and hash tables are hard and inefficient to implement using only stack memory.4. hash-tables pre-allocate chunks of memory before its ever used. if you want to save on memory you may want a different ADT.With that being said, when you mostly care about average case big O notations, hash-tables are pretty amazing. This is why they are often used in leet-code questions.",

Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic. I think the best thing you can do is write your question down now and come back to it in a few years, after you’ve taken more advanced courses. That goes back to item #1 on this list: trust your professors, they know a lot more than you do.",

What about a very ordinary programmer like me, with a couple of decades working in imperative languages where recursion is very much a choice?It's a tool for your mental toolbox. You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.Kinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common. Trees are obviously very likely to involve recursive operations and trees come up all the time in real world data wherever data are organised hierarchically: DOM trees, parse trees, nested spatial info, organisational charts, I'm sure you can think of many more examples where data are naturally nested in a self-similar manner.Most of my code is not recursive, but I wouldn't be a competent programmer if I didn't know how to use recursion when it's the better choice.",

To be fair, I've never applied to a job that was for, say, a React developer.The ones I've been that did coding were on paper or on a whiteboard. I believe the reason they did this was because using a computer with a specific IDE would favor someone that used that IDE or someone that uses an IDE over someone that just uses Notepad++ to code that only does syntax highlighting.It would be unfair to have interview someone where Netbeans was the IDE (since it's not that popular) or maybe IntelliJ (popular, but it costs money so some companies won't pay for it). And nowadays, there's AIs helping out.It is a mistake to think great coders code everything from scratch. If you use, say, Flutter, you're already not coding \"from scratch\". Someone built a web framework so you wouldn't have to code things from scratch. Also, frameworks have a lot of moving parts, so it's hard to recall it all.This is why you see leetcode problems because they require minimal knowledge of libraries and frameworks and mostly rely on DSA knowledge.It will depend on the interview. When I had one and asked if I could just use pseudocode, they kind of implied no. The problem with pseudocode is you could hand-wave many parts away saying surely there's an API to do X (when there isn't) and you avoid doing the real thinking.",

The first one would be to create a program that opened a window with the text \"Hello, World\", and then change that to \"playing music\" - the second would be opening a file, and not really doing anything with it, just opening it without crashing. The third would then be to play that file as a music-file - and since you probabaly don't know how to program that, but others have built libraries for it, you search for \"C++ Windows play mp3 file\" or something like that, and get some example code.You spend a lot of time getting that example code to work in your project, and then you've got your \"Music Player version 0.01\"Next step is then to maybe let the player display some info about the music being played - adding play, pause, stop, rewind buttons - adding a seekbar etc.Every tiny step makes the player better and better - and because it is tiny steps, you can search for specific help on \"how to create play/pause toggle-button\" rather than very generic \"how to create music player\".

Then you add other media types.In parallel to this, you build a GUI app. Display text, then a menu, then a wave. Then you put everything together. That’s your version 0. You iterate from there. If you want to do things properly, you can then spend time properly architecturing your application to make it more maintainable, extendable.

What do I want the MVP (minimum viable product) to do? Let's say open a window, queue up some music, and play the currently active file. So I need to be able to queue up some files and then play them in the queue order.3. Figure out what I'm going to have to learn how to use to accomplish that goal. So I'm at the very least going to need to learn to build the window, work with the GTK ListModel, and find a library that will play sound and hopefully handle all of the threading issues gracefully. SDL is a pretty good choice for a cross-platform sound playing library even though it's intended for games.4. Lay out the project directory as well as bolt together all of the libraries I need, and for a windowed application, make some kind of \"Hello, world!\" window.5. Do the rest of the work. I would likely consider that I'm going to need a SongPlayer class and a Playlist class and code those things up accordingly, then from there's it's wiring up button callbacks and updating the state of the window.",

Unless you are specifically using one of these protocols I would use the correct HTTP verbs wherever possible. Conforming to industry standards just makes everything easier. For example, many JS network libs (like Axios) understand that a HTTP status code of 400 is an error response and will throw an error on the client. This makes error handling client side a lot easier, as you can implement try/catch blocks.",

        "body": "I am of the camp that outside the most common status codes, no, you should not use most of the status codes that exist, because most of them have niche semantics that won't be applicable to you or are used in specific subprotocols that ride on top of HTTP like WebDAV, or HTTP extensions. Perhaps a 200 for an error is not OK, but I would prefer an API with consistent error responses to one that abuses 20 different HTTP statuses all slightly incorrectly. Same thing with HTTP verbs.Most HTTP status codes are designed to describe outcomes related to the transport itself rather than the business logic that is behind it, and as such, HTTP status codes should be used to describe issues that occur prior to any form of processing or side effect and past that you should fall back to a very small subset of statuses to describe the outcome. That is what a body is for.. The problem with this tends to be when people have to shoehorn complex behaviour into a single endpoint due to reasons outside their control, and they start abusing other HTTP status codes (especially WebDAV codes) to try and communicate their intent for things like partial success, or precondition failure, or side effects. They then do not realise half the HTTP status codes have strict and specific semantics about things like headers that should be included with them, and they break the rules of the spec by using them, which is far worse than just not using them at all. HTTP was not originally designed for requesting that Amazon sends you a new bag of cat food, it was designed for asking Amazon to show you a webpage about cat food.There is then confusion on what describes a client versus a server error. Does a 400 purely specify that a request looks okay, or does it imply that the actual data it represents is meaningful in terms of the current system state and data that is stored? Do you expect a server to start processing your request prior to giving a 400 back? Does bad request purely describe the request itself or the implication of that request? Do you consider a 500 to mean something went wrong during processing or just that your server is fucked? Once you get into the rabbithole of trying to work out exactly when each code is valid, you realise the system you are integrating with made a totally different decision on how to organise this and interpret it differently.The other issue is that some HTTP libraries made the somewhat braindead decision to throw exceptions when you get certain status codes, and this then makes integration more difficult. Really what you are often communicating is semantically tied to your own system, and if that is the case, using the body to communicate that rather than the status code can be more sensible.Even from a monitoring perspective, anything significant will be relying on application metrics rather than metrics from load balancers to determine system health. Load balancer metrics for status codes just give a rough idea of how much stuff is working versus not working.TLDR: 400, 401, 403, 404, 2xx, 500, 503 are OK. Use those as you will. Anything more complicated that is related to business logic should just be in a 200 or 500 and detail the issue in the body. Abusing other codes like 422, 423, 507 just because they \"sound like\" what you want is far worse than just using vague codes. If you are giving me a 479 Shits Fucked Yo designed to be used with WebFTP v2.718281828459045 from 1943, or a 486 Its Tuesday that Twitter used once, then I have a problem. Using 200 for errors might be controversial but if it is easier to do that and provide consistent responses in the body across your systems, then go for it. Whether you are checking a status code inside or outside a body, most programming languages use the same constructs to inspect it. If using a 3 digit number at the start of a response is what people think defines usability, then they are just gatekeeping unless there is an actual technical requirement for it.",

I’ve been in a similar boat, where the hands-on stuff takes priority, but then you start hitting roadblocks in interviews or realizing there are gaps in your understanding of core concepts.First off, don’t beat yourself up too much. You’ve already got a solid understanding of how to get things done in real-world scenarios, which is a huge plus. The next step is just filling in those gaps in theory and fundamentals.One option could be looking into free or low-cost online resources. There are a ton of high-quality materials out there. Sites like Coursera, edX, or freeCodeCamp offer courses that dive into algorithms, data structures, and other core topics. If you're feeling motivated enough to try something more structured, CS50 from Harvard is an amazing free intro to computer science.Another suggestion is tackling coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. They’ll help you get comfortable with algorithmic thinking and test your understanding of fundamental concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and graph theory. It can be tough at first, but it’s a great way to get that theory-practice balance.As for motivation, maybe set up a study routine that combines theory with practical application—like, for example, learn a concept in theory, then solve problems related to it. It’ll help you connect the dots and see the real-world value of what you're learning.In terms of classes, I’d say if you're going to invest in them, a well-structured, affordable course from places like Udemy or Pluralsight might give you more value for your money.

I found a lot of my spiraling was due to being overwhelmed \\- Optimize feedback loops. Fastest way to kill my productivity is needing to wait 5 mins to see if a fix worked. Test-driven development is nice. Fast builds are nice \\- Struggling with a problem? Write about it, pen & paper. Doodle if you want. Rant if you want. I personally find it more effective than rubber ducking \\- Silent timers: you may have heard of pomodoro timing, but I didn't mesh well with being interrupted right as I was in the flow. I do something pomodoro-like but keep the timers muted, and just switch when my focus is drifting and I notice my time is up \\- I found taskwarrior (CLI) meshes really well with my brain as a task tracker \\- Jumpstart guides: for larger projects that have some setup, I found it takes a lot of effort to get started making changes. I wrote a four-step \"jumpstarter\" for one of my projects that carefully walks through making a trivial hello-world-style change to one of the classes, building/deploying the project, and seeing the change on a UI. Takes like 30 seconds, but somehow, doing that helps get me in the headspace to start doing actual developmentYou mention a lot about reading unfamiliar code: unfortunately, this is more-or-less a practice game. Some more tricks that work for me in no particular order:\\- Above all else, make sure the code can run. Trying to do any development on code that doesn't run is a death sentence \\- Commit archaeology -- whole codebase is hard to read? Try git blaming some stuff you're interested in and just understanding one well-documented commit or PR \\- Documenting things -- there's probably missing comments that are making things tricky, may as well make it easier for the next guy. Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context \\- Debuggers are good, learn to use them \\- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of \"working effectively with legacy code\" \\- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etcOverall, I'm fond to say \"productivity is an engineering problem.\" It's not the type of thing where you just find The Solution and you're good to go. Any engineering problem worth talking about has competing solutions with tradeoffs that require a process of designing, implementing, testing, and revision. Try to find specific things that are killing your productivity (the 5 Whys technique is good) and hack at it like any other complex problem.",

You need to get good at troubleshooting and overcoming obstacles.Create a small project, then break it into tiny, winnable tasks. I also recommend splitting the creative and logical tasksBefore you start, take five minutes to remind yourself why you’re doing this and how you’ll feel in the future if you have not made progress. If you find your mind wandering, switch from logic tasks to creative.It won’t always feel good in the moment. Coding is often a battle with your own resistance. But the satisfaction comes after the struggle. Another method is freelancing take on small jobs and having the client and deadline is motivation. This will also give you real-world experience.",

What works best for me is a combination of small targeted problems on different topics and using questions/answers to test my knowledge.I’ve used LLMs for this. I’ve asked them to list out the main things I need to know without going into implementation and to then come up with a series of questions that would help me practice it. I go through the questions and code up the problems it gives me without looking at a solution. I take it as far as I can. I’m not concerned with being right, I’m concerned with training my brain to think. Some of my best learning came from allowing myself to do it my way all the way, even if it turned out to be dead wrong, because that teaches me exactly why things are done the way they are. I then take my solution back to the LLM and ask it to give constructive criticism. You can also get problems from a book or a website, it doesn’t have to be an LLM, but I like the instant feedback.Additionally, in my notes, along with having definitions for things I’m learning, I also have a questions section. The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.Bonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition. Once it has enough data on you, you can ask it something like ‘Based on out previous conversations on xyz, what do I know well, what are the areas where I need to improve and what learning style has proven to work best for me?’We learn in chunks. You have to build up those chunks one at a time and train your brain to think, not consume.",

I know that there are a lot of ways to do the same stuff. If you saw someone did something differently - it doesn't mean that you are wrong. It just means that you just discovered one more way to do the same stuff.Be proud to say \"I don't know\". Don't try to hide it. If you get into a place where people shame you for that phrase - they are stupid and cowards. Not knowing something is just a first step into knowing it. Without this step - you will never learn anything.I worked at some companies where the code base is so terrible that even with my bad experience I was shocked by its quality. And the people there were so proud of themselves.After that I started to realize that perfect code exists only in examples. If the project is live and constantly changing - the chances that it will become a monster are almost 99%.It doesn't mean that you should not care about your code. It means that at any point of your career what you know is enough. Just keep learning from your mistakes. And keep going.Perfectionism killed more projects than bad code. Because bad code actually works and perfect code works only in theory.",

Live is not a job and success is not a career. That's what I learned. About the cheating: there are 2 types of people, the ones that cheat a little, and the ones that are too afraid to admit it.Focus on managing your mental resources and give your best without physically and mentally harming yourself, you have at least 40 years to work on a job before you can retire, so focus on being able to work for that long. Live is not a sprint, it's a marathon.Now that doesn't mean you should be lazy or anything, but I was your age when I got my first job in IT, and I was learning to program since I was like 16 years of age.

Learn everything you can about installing and maintaining a Linux system. RHCSA is good, but not needed. Learn Docker and Kubernetes. Learn a cloud service like AWS or Azure. Most importantly, always be ready to learn. I did all that and applied to a DevOps/Sys Admin role. The company I applied to also needed intern product developer role. I volunteered for that. Did a 6 month internship. Pretty weird to be an intern as a 34 year old, but I’d like to think I killed it there. They made me a permanent employee on June 1st and I’m loving it. I suppose being a bit older than a regular intern motivated me to put my best foot forward. I volunteered to do things no one else wanted to. Learned a lot in the process.

What matters as a software developer is your ability to creatively problem-solve using the fundamentals of computer science to tackle complex tasks. Being good at this will make you successful in all parts of SWE.If you want a decent-paying job as a software developer, here is your roadmap:1. Go to school for a CS degree2. Get an internship during your studies3. Between school, work, etc, practice building large, complex, full-stack projects to showcase on your resume4. By the time you graduate, you will probably spend several months to a year competing for entry-level jobsJumping in to SWE expecting your life to quickly improve is a mistake. You missed the boat by around 10+ years.",

Nursing is absolutely recession proof. People always get sick, and there's a massive shortage of nurses. Plus at 48, you'd have a solid 20+ year career ahead of you.But since you asked about tech longevity... AI/ML, cybersecurity, and mobile development aren't going anywhere. Web development is evolving but still fundamental. The thing is, tech moves fast and you gotta keep learning constantly. At Metana we see people in their 40s and 50s successfully transition into development, but it takes real commitment to stay current.Here's what I'd consider in your shoes. What actually interests you more? Do you want to help people directly through healthcare, or do you get excited about building things digitally? Both can be financially rewarding but they're completely different day to day experiences.Also, have you thought about healthcare tech? There's tons of opportunity there, especially for people who understand both sides. But honestly, if you're leaning toward nursing for the stability and recession-proofing, that's totally valid reasoning.The rental income gives you flexibility to take either path without desperation, which is huge. Most people don't have that luxury when making career pivots.",

If it's about \"need,\" the answer is \"not much,\" because there's such a wide range of specializations needing different things. Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.For example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.As you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to \"just know\" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they \"need\" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.This especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.So, overall, I think the answer is \"learn *some* things well.\" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library. Looking things up on the job is fine, but learn from those resources, don't just drop them and move on as soon as you've found an answer.",

This just comes with time. At first you will be constantly looking things up, but eventually it will start to sink in.

You could also consider the CS50 online course (it's free), if you want good fundamentals and don't have any projects in mind yet.

You still have to actually learn how to program and you should learn it on SOMETHING, once you understand the concepts and get a flow for making things it becomes easier to pick up another language. I wouldn't leave yourself not understanding async for example, it is used almost everywhere, even if you aren't writing it, it will be built into the libraries you are using. The best way to learn is to do, so pick a language and try to write something with a thread or two just to see how it is done and run the thought exercise for managing the sync and flow of everything. I think the advice is true, when you get your job you will be working in the tech stack the company has and most of the difficulty will be figuring out the companies code base, so while you might be an expert in one language they may be using another. However, this does not mean that it doesn't make your life easier to know one language and just learn the ins and outs of the other language vs trying to figure out say async concepts while figuring out he language, it is much better to pick up a language and read what kind of async stuff is in the language while understanding the concepts and challenges ahead of time. It is much better to help you evaluate the code base as well if you have a good understanding of what 'good' can look like. Another interpretation of it might really be that you can't learn everything a computer can do now a days, it is essentially infinite as it continuously expands day bay day. But again, do not take this as don't bother mastering what you are working on, or, i don't get this topic and am free to moving on. If you move on make it for a good reason, you won't ever use it perhaps or hate it so much you would refuse a job working with it etc.",

Frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile apps, even desktop apps. More versatility means more job opportunities. The learning curve can be a bit weird at first but once it clicks, you're golden. C# is great too, especially if you're thinking enterprise development or want something more structured. Microsoft ecosystem is huge and pays well.At Metana we see a lot of career changers and the ones who succeed fastest are usually those with some kind of customer facing or problem solving background. They just \"get\" what users need in a way that pure CS grads sometimes dont.My advice? Pick JavaScript, build a few projects that solve real problems you've seen in help desk work, and apply for roles that value that crossover like developer advocate positions, technical support engineering, or even full stack roles at smaller companies.Either way you choose though, you're already ahead of most beginners because you understand the business side of tech. Don't underestimate that advantage :)",

In just a couple months, you can:• Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript • Understand how to structure and style a webpage • Add interactivity with JavaScript • Build simple websites, landing pages, and portfolios • Clone real websites like blogs or product pages to sharpen your skillsThat gives you momentum, and it’s enough to get noticed. But the real growth happens after those first few months. Buuuuuut, that’s also when things start to feel much harder, and where most people drop off. They get stuck and lose motivation, or don’t know what to learn next.If you’re serious about learning web development and actually becoming a real developer, my community on Skool can guide you every step of the way.

But as a newbie learning core ideas, be that in mathematics, or programming, or otherwise, the \"solve it yourself\" approach of so many old school masters is well evidenced as being a poor route.I would recommend a middle road.Getting AI to simply spam code at you is a terrible idea. But having it do code reviews, and even to give you clear answers so you know what to do, is a good idea. There is very little value in sitting there for a day, struggling to figure out how to align things in CSS, if you could have learned the core functions of flex and grid in 30 minutes and then spent the day actually practicing them.Be sensible. You seem like a smart person. So you can tell the difference between a case where you are using AI to do the work for you vs using it to teach you things in an efficient way. And don't depend only on AI. But it is a powerful tool and you should use it. There are many Luddites who swear off it and will tell you that you will never code if you touch it.

If you make a change where you later find out something broke, you can always revert back to the commit where you know everything worked.Of course there is still lots of room for improvement here with proper branching strategies. But to start off, this is better than nothing.**Tests:**In your case, I would really suggest writing integration or end to end tests. Ignore unit tests completely.All you want to know is that broadly speaking, your feature set works as intended. Caring about every single unit of code is not where you're at.[Test bahavior, not implementation details](https://codeling.dev/blog/testing-behavior-or-implementation/) which will tell you immediately if any of your features break and makes refactoring code much less risky and certainly less of a pain in the a$$.**Where to start:**Since you're really concerned about existing working features breaking when you change something, I would really suggest writing a few tests for the most important features.Maybe start working in version control when you feel you're up to it,...but at least start with a few end to end or integration tests which focus on behavior. It's easier than you think,....and actually quite fun,...and makes you feel safe making changes or new features.",

For beginner to intermediate topics there are already enough resources that exist for you to become a fantastic programmer. AI is like having a really smart friend, that will happily just do your work for you, even if you ask it not too. This is great when you have a job, but if he does all your homework (or practice projects) you will literally learn nothing. And I'll answer the rebuttal I always hear : > but connorjpg what if I understand its outputYou mean you understand the assumed correct answer that was given to you? Yeah I can understand a test when I have the answer key infront of me. Doesnt mean I will remember, why, how or when to use these answers. And as soon as I take the test I will forget everything... Not to mention the more complex the questions you ask the higher chance there will be integration issues or just flat out incorrect returns, and without underlying understanding of the basics you will be completely lost.

They make surprisingly human errors (I had one recite an entire regulation paragraph semantically correct but with the wrong number), and even now often remembers outdated information.- Do not ask for patterns or strategies by name. LLMs will start rambling and get lost in bullshit bingo and buzzwords.

Can you give a 20 word or so summary of each?” And from that list you could pick one out and go to MDN to read the docs or something.

That's actually not old at all in tech, and honestly some of the sharpest people I know didn't really hit their stride until their 40s or later.Your IT support background is actually gold. Most college grads and junior devs have zero real world troubleshooting experience, but you've got 4 years of it. That's huge when things break in production.About the ADHD thing, look, it can be challenging but it can also be a superpower once you find your groove. The hyperfocus aspect is incredible for debugging or diving deep into problems that would frustrate other people.Regarding web dev vs cloud/cyber? honestly with your AZ-900 already done, you've got momentum there. Don't underestimate that achievement. The fact that you passed shows you can learn new tech. At Metana we've had plenty of career changers in their 40s and 50s. What I notice is they often outperform younger students because they have better work discipline and actually know what they want from their career.My take? Pick one path and commit for 6 months. Based on what you've shared, cloud seems like the natural next step. Go for AZ-104 next, build some projects, document everything you do. The networking and scripting stuff will come as you practice.You're not behind. You're just getting started on the next chapter :)",

I remember feeling exactly like this when I was starting out and honestly, even now running Metana and helping train developers, I still see this pattern with almost every single student who transitions into their first dev role.Here's the thing that might help reframe this. You upgraded Node containers, used new JS features, AND you sought help when you hit a roadblock. That's actually really solid problem-solving. Yeah, you could have done the cloud builder upgrade yourself, but how were you supposed to know that without... well, being told exactly what happened?Your tech lead isn't frustrated with you, they're teaching you. There's a huge difference. If they thought you were doing poorly, trust me, you'd know it. The fact that they're giving you your own features to plan means they see potential.At Metana, I always tell our bootcamp grads that the first 6-12 months are basically extended learning with a paycheck. You're not supposed to know everything yet. The goal is to learn fast and not make the same mistake twice.One thing that really helped me early on was keeping a \"learning log\". Just a simple doc where I'd write down these exact situations. What I did, what I learned, how I'd handle it next time. Looking back at it after a few months was eye-opening because I could see how much I'd actually grown.Also, 5 months in and you're already handling complex features and supporting QA? That's actually ahead of the curve. Most devs I know were still figuring out the codebase at that point.The imposter syndrome is real but it gets better as you build up more of these learning experiences. Just don't let it paralyze you from taking on those new features they want you to plan.",

Gaming is a huge industry and there are loads of jobs in it so you shouldn't think of making mods for Minecraft as something that diverts from becoming a programmer in the future. In fact I'd argue that it is a really good place to start because you are interested in the game, so you will be very invested in learning. I learned HTML at around your age because I wanted to make fan sites for bands I was into. Whatever it is that gets you interested in learning is important. And employers are still going to see coding skill in making mods for games, so don't worry too much that it is a distraction, or diversion from your goal of becoming a programmer.",

(e.g \"woof woof\" for dog, \"nyaa\" for cat). \\- The age value should not be longer than 20 for cat, 18 for dogTry and create that application. You don't need to use database or txt or external store. just an application that you can create Cat and Dog object in main function. It's simple application that make use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation that you mention.

It's a silly thing to need to know how to do, but it really helps, and you'll start getting \\*much\\* more precise at reading/writing/debugging syntax in other contexts too.Regarding the actual topics, I agree with others that finding another textbook might be the way to go if your lecturer isn't working out for you. Many of the types of people who write textbooks are really passionate about teaching, and have put in a lot of work to put their own spin on these concepts. There's a lot of recs online that you can try reviewing.I personally really liked making my own versions of others' abstractions. E.g. at some point I wrote a program (mini search engine) that used my own version of the \\`List\\` interface with my own implementations of \\`LinkedList\\` and \\`ArrayList\\`. I also liked making a \\`Logger\\` interface supporting a \\`println\\` method that could interchangeably log to the console, to a file, to an encrypted file (with caesar cipher), and to a graphical window.",

If you’re just starting out, I’d recommend following his YouTube playlists in the order he’s arranged them - he usually builds up from basics to advanced topics, so it’s a good flow for learning concepts step by step.Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you can use his TUF website to focus on specific topics or practice questions. The site is great for targeted revision and for brushing up on theory before tackling coding problems. Some people like to watch the theory video for a topic, then immediately try related questions from the site—that’s a solid approach too.So, in short: - If you want a structured path, follow the YouTube playlist order- If you want to focus on certain topics or practice, use the TUF website to pick and choose.

More practically: imagine that these questions aren't created in code as part of an exercise/test but are simply read from a database. and another tool is used to insert the questions into the database. So as a programmer you have no idea how many questions there are or how to name them.It makes a lot more sense to simply throw them into a list (the list of questions). In your case because you run into exercises and example code, often people want to show you things you'll encounter in later life but run into the problem that doing the setup for these sorts of systems would distract you from the thing they are trying to teach. So they compromise.Personally I would find it better to use a function that returns the questions (in your case). the function will return a list of questions and you can add in comments / naming of the function that it represents a lookup from file or database. that way you can practice working with abstractions / accepting data comes from another location (without needing to know exactly how it is put together)",

The senior developers aren't there to be a personal tutor. A lot of programming is your attitude to programming. I've heard of some senior developers who had a junior developer that decided they didn't have to figure out how to do the task assigned to them. They would just ask the senior developer who got frustrated (and did it for them).The problem with hiring someone that's new is they can be a net negative. I've seen posters who say \"if they're so desperate to hire programmers, why is it so hard to get a job\" (this was in the past when there was more need for programmers). The answer is a bad programmer is worse than no programmer at all. They introduce bugs. They require hand-holding. Even with experience, they sometimes never get much better. With so many programmers out there, companies can be picky and pick those that are ready to go. There are internships for those that are part-way through their CS major degree, but even in an internship, they assume you can pick up coding, figure out an API, etc. But it's hard to tell how much you know, so you might be ready. Have you tried building a small webapp? I'd say, apply, and see what happens. Even those that seem well-prepared are struggling to get replies (e.g., those that have a CS degree).",

Second goal is to make it nicer to read, which means separating stuff out into functions, and if it's really its own monster, taking up half the main file, to a module it goes, purely for ease of use. I almost never set out with an idea how how many or what types of modules will need, I just come to points in the process where I'm like, damn that's ugly, or I realize that I'm re-using stuff, or this function is huge, let's throw it in a new file.Of course if you find yourself creating something where it's extremely obvious that you'll be using it all over, then sure, go ahead and proactively write it as a module from the get go and build it up as you go.",

Just endless pain and headaches and frustration. But until you experience some of that pain, none of the strategies to solve it really make that much sense. And when you're starting out working on smaller projects, often a lot of code organization is kind of optional anyways because you're not dealing with enough complexity for it to really matter.So, like, sure, read about it. Think about it. But understand that what will make it click is getting your hands dirty in the guts of big, complex codebases.This is the kind of thing that, although there are principles that can be applied, really needs experience and developing some *intuition* for the problem in order to be able to do well at it.

A function is a set of code that performs a specific task, and can be reused repeatedly. For example, thinking of a simple calculator application that we want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. When we think about specific tasks that can be made into functions, it sounds like we will need a function for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as those are all specific tasks that we want to perform repeatedly. Of course, identifying functions gets more complicated for larger projects, but you don't need to know all the functions you could possibly need ahead of time. Modularization isn't something that happens completely up-front before you program anything, it's something that you will do throughout the programming process. For me what works is outlining functions I know I need at the beginning, then starting to write my program and looking out for sections of code that are reused multiple times. When I realize it is something that is going to be reused, I move it to a function. Basically, keep an eye out for things that your program will be doing a lot of. Any time you are seeing the same logic repeated, or have something that performs a specific task, those are good things to consider putting into functions. Don't worry if you can't identify everything in advance or feel like it's a struggle at first. That's part of the learning process and I promise, it gets easier the more you do it!",

        "body": "In my real world experience, unless you are maintaining a very large project over a long time period, software architecture techniques like modularization are overrated and sometimes harmful in that they can make it harder to pivot between different overall approaches to the application. In my opinion it’s similar in this way to object oriented design. I use a limited version of both in my personal projects and when I’m working on small teams.For modularizing, you generally start with one file, and then at some point you break it into multiple files just as a basic organizing step. And yes you often make classes to encapsulate natural units, like a matrix class, a networking class, a class for the application overall.But once you start going crazy with lots and lots of classes, and complex class hierarchies, you make it harder to make those fundamental pivots.As a simple concrete example, an oop book might tell you a personnel management app should have an Employee class and from that derive classes for various types of employees, probably using intermediate classes, like a Manager class, from which you derive UnitManager and SeniorExec, all with their own classes. This might work out well in certain cases, if you’re lucky. But in my experience, just make the one Employee class and give it a “type” member. See how far that gets you before making a tree of classes, each probably in their own code file. And the same idea goes for overall modularization.I have a saying: Don’t divide and conquer yourself.",

We don't know what is going to change, but we know that change is inevitable. Maybe an API you depend on gets a breaking change, maybe you want to drastically change the way you display stuff to users, maybe you discover a major security flaw with how you're handling data etc etc...The way we prepare for that is not by thinking about every possible scenario and making preparations, but instead by building systems that are flexible to change. One way you could achieve that is by following the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).1. Limit your modules to only one responsibility. ([example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON))2. Write your modules to be open to extension, but closed to modification. ([example](https://alexnault.dev/open-closed-principle-in-functional-typescript))3. Any substitute modules you write should not break the program. ([example: a square data object is not a valid substitute for a rectangle data object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle#Violation))4. Keep code decoupled from other code it does not need. The math module does not need to know about drawing boxes on the DOM.5. Depend on interfaces rather than specific implementations. Makes it trivial to substitute behavior.",

The thing is, you're actually doing everything right by understanding concepts and practicing, but there's a gap between \"getting it\" and \"doing it from scratch.\"Here's what usually helps.1. Stop trying to memorize syntax. Seriouslyy. Even experienced devs look stuff up constantly. Focus on understanding the WHY behind data structures instead of memorizing how to implement them perfectly.2. Try the 'explain it to a rubber duck\" method. Before you code, explain out loud what you're trying to build and why. 3. Build the same data structure multiple times but solve different problems with it. Don't just implement a stack. Use it to check balanced parentheses, then use it for undo functionality etcc. This builds real understanding.Also, data structures in Java can be tricky because there's so much syntax to remember. Focus on understanding the concepts first, then worry about perfect implementation later.You're not behind. You're exactly where you should be in the learning process :)",

That's WHY Stack Overflow exists, and why it's so active after so long and so many changes to the platform. All developers forget the little bits from time to time, and it sucks because the code won't run without them, but it's just how it works. Our brains are not computers, so speaking computer languages, especially like Java, doesn't come naturally. When you were learning English, you didn't say everything correctly all the time either, and you still don't, but obviously you know English, and you can communicate your point well enough that everyone here, native English speaker or not, understands you. It's the same for Java, or any other coding language. You'll always be looking up this syntax or that function. Eventually, the things you're learning now will become second nature when you've used them in 50 different programs or functions. But by then, you'll be looking up other things you just can't remember the exact way to do. Don't stress about this part.But if, even after looking it up and getting the code to compile and do what you want it to do, you're not proud of yourself, then you might want to consider whether this is the right career for you. Because honestly, I will spend 60+ hours on a bug sometimes, and I have literally thrown a party (a happy hour with coworkers) when I got to a different error message I hadn't seen before. The bug wasn't fixed, but I had made some kind of progress, because now I was executing a different part of the code, and that was worth celebrating. If you don't want to party when the code works right (or at least more right), then you are either taking it all too seriously, or you might not have the right temperament for Software Engineering.Good luck!!",

The course is set up for ten weeks, but this is a Harvard course and as a college course, it's pretty aggressive to finish so quickly. I would budget twice the time, maybe twenty weeks which is about 5 months, but take all the time you need. You don't have to race to the answer. You may feel like you have to be efficient, but expect to be slow, and don't pressure yourself to move faster because you'll likely skip information you need by trying to \"keep up\".**How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?**You've only given yourself 5 weeks. You are unlikely to finish unless you are either smart or cheat (you may think using ChatGPT is not cheating, but it is). The class already takes ten weeks for Harvard students, and you want to do it in half the time. Spending lots of hours, esp. on academic topics, is not always productive. There's this joke that goes \"if it takes 9 months for a woman to have a baby, then it should take 9 women 1 month each to have a baby\" which means that you can't speed up certain things. I mean, if you can spend that time and not go brain dead, then good for you. Give it a try. But most people find it hard to focus for more than about 3 hours a day. If you try for more, you'll need a break, and you'll have to be making some progress during that time.You might get through the C coding part if you happen to be quick (so 5 weeks).**How does submission of problem sets and projects work?**I think you need to read this and figure it out. It is a bit elaborate involving using Github and setting that up. Harvard doesn't want to be in business of managing user accounts. There are instructions on how to do this. I would say, outside of the actual programming itself, it's this part that's kind of annoying. You just have to follow the steps carefully, that's all. I would probably suggest using their version of Visual Studio Code (assuming they still use it).**Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?**You'll be instructed how to do this. This is the kind of question that suggest apprehension on your part. Read it, dig in, and figure it out. It's a useful skill to be able to work through problems.**Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!**The problem sets (which are the programming assignments) are challenging. I've taught intro programming and I would likely not give that level of difficulty to a class. In particular, CS50x uses more math than the projects I used to assign. Also, some projects are considered notoriously challenging. One is called Tideman. Usually, they have an easier version of the project and a harder one. You might opt to do the easier one.One reason Tideman is challenging is the length of the description of what to do. Beyond that, it's hard to visualize the arrays to place the data. If C were object-oriented, it might be easier to understand (though still not easy).Expect it to be challenging. Don't worry if you don't complete the course in a month. You're expecting a lot, maybe too much. Any progress would be considered good. Try not to be disappointed if you only get through, say, 3 weeks of the course in the time allotted. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed.Anyway, good luck. Hope you get done as much as you plan, but even if you don't you took some initiative which is a positive attitude.",

Focus on making sure that what you cover in x time, you fully understand and can demonstrably use (the problem sets will test this).I would take notes through using comments in your code. When you come back some time later to your code, comments really get you up to speed quickly. I would advise a good ol' fashioned notepad and pencil to help you with the problem sets. It really helps when you design potential solutions that you can draw / write out steps in psuedocode.TL;DR as another poster said, just do!",

Being too careless sucks, being too careful sucks. Really good advice, specially because it might pass as \"obvious\" for some people.Other than that, a good guiding comment on how to tackle CS50. I did most of the course's problems (Didn't make the final one, so no certificate to show) and even though I already had some experience with C(just as a student, I don't have any professional experience), Tideman gave me a few hours of thinking and stressing over. The course is indeed challenging and it brushes over some of topics that will require more studying if you want a better understanding, such as data structures and algorithms, how memory works and so on.Not OP, but thank you for the comment and willingness to share your experience in depth.",

But that was only because they knew how to do Google searches (I'm talking about those who took this approach before ChatGPT was a thing) and learned just enough to make progress. That kind of person assumes that this is the approach that works for everyone. They like the approach that allows them to work on a problem and get to a solution with the minimum amount of theoretical work. But it doesn't work for everyone. Some need more guidance on how to think before they dive into doing a project. Also, picking a good project that is at the right level is hard. Most pick too challenging a project or can't figure out how to pick a project that interests them.Anyway, I appreciate your opinions!",

The downfall to reading too much is that everything makes sense as you read it, but, you're not really getting it. You just feel like you are. Then, you finish the book thinking you have a great understanding of the language the book covered, and programming in general, and start to write something and your mind will just blank out on you.

Learning new skills is always hard, but it's rewarding. If you can't code without AI, you don't have the knowledge to know whether the code the AI is making even does what you want it to do. If you're content just hacking together and remixing existing code that's fine, but it's a pretty sad goal to shoot for. It isn't hard to be a bad programmer.",

        "body": "In Python, `super()` and `Class.__init__()` are related to how inheritance works.In the first example where you use `super().__init__(side, side)`, `super()` is a special function that refers to the parent class in the method resolution order (MRO). When you call `super().__init__(side, side)`, it’s essentially telling Python to look up the inheritance chain and call the `__init__` method of the parent class (which in this case is `Rectangle`). This allows the `Square` class to inherit and use the initialization logic of the `Rectangle` class without explicitly referencing `Rectangle` by name. When `super().__init__(side, side)` is called, it sets the `height` and `width` attributes of the `Square` instance (which is `s`), because `super()` is calling `Rectangle.__init__` internally and passing the values to it.Now, in the second example, `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)` does something similar but directly. You’re calling the `__init__` method of the `Rectangle` class explicitly. Here, `Rectangle.__init__` sets the `height` and `width` attributes on the `Square` instance (`s`) in the same way, but this time, you’re directly referencing the parent class.In both cases, the key point is that calling `__init__` on a class (whether via `super()` or directly) will set up the attributes of the instance. When you do `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)`, it sets `self.height` and `self.width` on the `Square` instance, just as if the `Square` class was directly calling `Rectangle`'s `__init__` method.The reason this works, even though `Rectangle` is a class, is because `Rectangle.__init__` is a method that belongs to the class and can be called just like any other method. The instance (`self` in `Square`) is passed along, so it has access to the attributes defined within the method.",

All classes in python return objects when instanciated. `super()` returns what the documentation calls a \"proxy object\".https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#superProxy objects are special. They are bound to a type and an instance of a type. When any method is called on them, they search the [method-resolution-order (MRO)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) for this combination, and call that instead.The actual call signature of `super`:```super(type, object_or_type)```Takes these 2 arguments. Usually, `type` is a class, `object_or_type` is an instance of that class. When called without argument but directly followed by a method call, these arguments default to the enclosing class and the calling instance.Therefore, let's break down what happens in the case you described:> super is a class therefore super().__init__(side, side) should create instance of the class super1. `super()` returns a proxy object, bound to the type `` and the current instance of that class2. `.__init__` tells the proxy object: \"Search the MRO for this instance of this class 'upwards' for a method called `__init__`\"3. The search determines that the method to call is `Rectangle.__init__`4. `(side, side)` now calls `Rectangle.__init__` with `side` as the value for both arguments",

It could work \"behind the scenes\" (meaning that your front-facing public methods `FindById`, etc. *call* the generic `GetEntry` with the appropriate arguments) so that you don't have to rewrite the entire methods. This way, you have one method that does the work and separate methods for code clarity facing the front/user side.The dedicated methods (no matter which way, as independent methods, or calling the generic) have the advantage that they assure only valid fields can be queried.There is only one caveat `String field` is a bad idea. Such a limited, restricted, well defined value should be an *enum* so that typos, wrong values, etc. are directly caught.",

        "body": "Well put it like this:in the first case, each method only does one thing. this is helpful. It also signals clearly what each method is doing, which is autodocumenting. in the second case you have to look a little closer. And while it can be convenient to use \"field\" as a variable that means people could call it like: GetEntry(someVariable, someValue);leaving you with no idea what is going on. (or whether someVariable actually exists). now imagine this call is being done in code outside of your reach. (a client library for instance). you wouldn't know what variables they are using. so if you ever change the database you won't have an automatic warning that the field they are selecting on exists. Except at runtime which is not ideal. If you make the same changes in the first example, (remove a findBy..... because the field is no longer offered), the client will get a compilation error when a developer updates to the latest version of your library. which they will be much happier about than an error in the rare situation a user sorts a table by pressing a UI element the developers never touch.I know what I write is slightly charged / exaggerated but I tried to sketch the use cases where you would know the difference.I think you are falling into a beginner trap where more code looks inefficient. And creating a godly one-liner that handles everything / runs the whole program looks good. But more verbose self-documenting code generally is code that will have less bugs later on. because you won't be the only programmer working on your code. You may not even be at the employer when someone tries to work on a function / replaces something. for instance in your case: it is easy to replace findById with findByIdOrSecondaryId because it'll be clear where you use it and you'll get a compiler error if you forget one since the original doesn't exist. But it is entirely possible you overlook GetObject( \"id\") (possibly because of whitespace differences and such.Think about cleanness of code in the sense that it should be straightforward to read. Don't shy away from extra functions. However what you can do is have findByName and findByEmail and findById all internally call GetEntry(string field, string value) if you wish. (to share error handling/recovery/etc). that way you present stable methods to the outside world and you can have more generic reusable functions for internal use.none of this is absolute truth of course, just advice",

For another customer (a university), we built a search form where students could search for and apply to different courses. The students were seldom users, had no knowledge of different parameters, so had just one free-form text input that we matched against a special database view where we merged all relevant data from different tables and columns into one against which we matched the query (the more words that matched in a resulting row, the higher the score the result got).A search index could be an alternative; again, much depends on the type of application you build and your requirements.",

I have to have some other information in order to actually use your method. Maybe you added the valid fields to the documentation for the function, and maybe that comes up as part of intellisense, but then I have to read through the description and I could still mistype one of the field names.With individual methods I hit . on your model and intellisense gives me a list of all the ways I can use it.

        "body": "Well there's two things here:1. If you need a game to make programming fun, then you're not interested in programming as a career.2. Some aspects of game programming are much harder than the usual fields of programming.I would say it's only good if they're already interested in programming and it focuses on the hard parts of game programming.If the course focuses on how to make a game, then they'll learn how to make a game, not programming. Almost no game design courses teach any amount of programming.If it's writing their own game engine or something, then it teaches a lot more.Also you can't say \"learn to program\" and \"JavaScript\" with a straight face. It's sad to see the focus entirely on WebDev. What is the goal: do you want them to learn programming or WebDev? GameDev is not a good way to learn WebDev.If you look at the CS50 course, you can see the order they go in: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/)They actually begin by having people make a game. But they basically learn no programming from it because it's using Scratch. I actually think that week could have been replaced with something better. Notice how they go all the way through an intro course and through Data Structures before they even start WebDev.I spent many years making games on Atari XE and graphing calculators. I went to a community college after that and learned basic programming. But a single Data Structures course was more impactful on my ability to program than all those years of experience combined.Also when I tutored math, people always said the same thing. They hated math until they learned it properly, then they loved it. They were so happy doing it. Teachers focus too much on making things \"fun\" instead of making things understandable. The fun comes naturally when they're learning.",

        "body": "I have tried making some introductory programming curricula based on making games, as well as an advanced DSA course - not as \"game design courses\", but simply using games as the applications that the students had to build.I still think it is an excellent idea, and it works really well, especially because when writing a game, you naturally run the code over and over, and it is never exactly the same, so you constantly discover new issues, more things to learn. Whereas if you build a program to display a list of items from a database, the moment you got a list, you are done, and leave that part of the code. Also, when you make a game you feel like you've built something - and you are proud to show it to others, and let them play it. Whereas when you've made a form for entry into a database, well ... :)And I believe that you can learn any programming topic from writing games - there's almost no single algorithm, pattern or data structure that doesn't fit into some game or other.However, I've had some issues - mostly with students and especially other teachers not understanding what they actually learned, so I'll give you some of them as \"warnings\" - not warnings against doing it, but warnings about how it might be received.* Students have a really hard time transferring skills between writing different kinds of software - when they learned how to write games, they didn't understand how it could be used in database-applications, when they learned frontend coding, they didnt' understand how it could be used in backend, then they learned terminal-applications they didn't understand how it could be applied to web-applications, and so on. It is important to add other kinds of applications using the same patterns as they learned in the games - so they don't think that it is a \"games course\", but see how learning to code with games, is just learning to code.* Students are extremely scared of math - not just matrix-calculations, or trigonometry, but something as simple as ratios, converting a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 50 and 300 is almost impossible for them to grasp. And in games there's a lot of math. Don't be discouraged by it, just be prepared to spend A LOT of time explaining even the simplest calculations.* Some students actively dislike having to create or even obtain graphics and other assets. But on the other hand they don't like just being given assets and \"forced\" to use them - expect to spend quite a bit of time explaining how to prepare those as well :)* As games get a bit more complex, there is a lot of prep-work in building the level or setting up the code for input. I recommend re-using code throughout the course, and copying in earlier \"blocks\" from some games to re-use later, so the students don't feel like they spend all their time typing in \"platform code\".* A lot of programming students nowadays actually don't know that many \"simple\" games, so it might be necessary with a bit of games history as well, to teach them about top-down, platforms, scrollers, shooters, and so on. I was surprised at how few of my references my students actually recognized - even when it got to board games!But otherwise, I think that it is a really, really good idea - and don't listen to the \"haters\" talking about how games programming and JavaScript isn't \"real\" programming! Every kind of programming is programming, and if something can inspire students to build more on their own, it is even better!",

That's fine - we all start at the same place.>I made a calculator that you can use your terminal but that's pretty much it.How does it work? Can I type in 5 \\* 6 + (3 - 4) / 8, and it will give me the right answer, or is it more restricted than that? Can it handle fractions? Can it handle exponentiation? Factorials? Basic polynomial algebra? If I give it an unusual expression like 3 - (-(-2)), does it handle it as expected? If I give it a syntactically illegal expression like \"5 + \\* 5\", or a mathematically illegal expression like \"3 / 0\", does it handle it gracefully without crashing?There's a **lot** that goes into building a calculator, and this kind of thing might be an interesting project. If you're not interested in calculators, don't think of it as a calculator: think of it as \"teaching the computer to understand commands\". This is a whole field in its own right - tokenising, lexing, parsing, building syntax trees, Backus-Naur, and all that - and this is a (small but significant) step towards building something like a compiler. (As a side benefit, it will also make you better at understanding and reading certain kinds of documentation.)Also: when you do this, you'll probably want to reuse your old calculator code, but you might find that extending your code to accept these new features is more trouble than it's worth, and you have to rewrite it from scratch. Don't be afraid of doing this, even multiple times if you have to - in fact, I think it's a really good thing in the learning stage. Implementing individual features is one thing, but learning how to structure large projects in a clean and modular way - so that you can swap out features, upgrade them, rewrite them without changing all the rest of your code - is a skill in its own right.>I saw a guy build a snake game that was cool.Why not try building that yourself? Or Pac-Man, or Tetris. It can be in the terminal if you want - just redraw the board as a grid of characters every second - it'll look ugly, but that's fine.That said, if you're feeling up to something a bit more of a challenge, then why not learn to use a library like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)? That's a simple way of getting graphics onto the screen. Fair warning: once you start using external libraries, the difficulty **does** spike a little, because you're suddenly having to learn a whole new feature set that you know nothing about, with all of the syntactic difficulties that come along with it. In practice, what that means is you will spend a lot of time learning how to read documentation efficiently, which is also a crucial skill for a programmer.>I don't exactly know the full capabilities of c++ so I'm open to suggestions.Literally anything a computer can do, you can do it in C++. Most operating systems are written in C, which you can think of as a very bare-bones version of C++. Most modern programming languages have compilers / interpreters written in C/C++. Most browsers and web servers are written in C/C++. The main barrier here is not the capability of C++: it's the fact that even very \"simple\" software can be tens of thousands of lines of code, and you need to work towards that. So don't be afraid to rewrite things that people have already written before: they will be very valuable learning tools.",

Yes, the way your program is currently implemented may need only one instance of a Configuration. But software changes over time and I've seen it plenty of times that something was introduced as a singleton when only one instance of the thing was required and later it turned out that (under certain conditions) you need multiples of that thing. Something as simple as a test that runs the code that depends on the singleton twice can become impossible to implement properly. And refactoring a singleton away can be a lot of work.Another general issues with singletons is that you can access them from anywhere (as there often is a global Singleton::GetInstance() function or similar). This means that (as opposed to using dependency injection) it is hard to tell what code depends on the existence of that singleton, making it hard to reason about the code. And then there are other issues like initialization/deinitialization and dependencies between multiple singletons, etc. That's the reason why the singleton pattern is considered an anti-pattern.That being said there are common cases where I see singletons used frequently (e.g. for a clock or a logger object) where it can be justified but even for those I've seen it cause problems that they are implemented as singletons.For your specific case, I would not implement a Configuration as a singleton. The example you provide (multiple instances of calculations using their own copy of a Configuration object) is reason enough to not make it a singleton.",

So it is also necessary to track down real JavaScript \"source code\" (i.e. unminified code) to learn how people are writing this.Nowadays a lot of people also write TypeScript as the source code, which \"compiles\" (sometimes called \"Transpiled\" in this context) down to plain JavaScript. But again, the notation in the original TypeScript will be lost, and that stuff was written in the code for a reason --- so you've got to go to that source code and understand why it was written the way it was originally written.",

You should be flexible to go software based stack like java , .Net as a backup. Or another web based stackSame for 'what to learn' it's all in the requirements in job applications. See a position that asks for python, docker, cloud ? Etc, learn it, make project, update portfolio rinse and repeat.Data science is completely different and I think it will be very hard to learn both for development and a data role :SQL, python, datamodeling, ML, DL , statistical analysis, brush up on statistics and mathematics.You have EE master degree which is a strong degree but still not that related to software or DS so make sure that you have a strong portfolio.",

You already understand complex systems and problem-solving at a level most bootcamp grads dont have.For where to apply, try AngelList for startups, they're more willing to take chances on potential over perfect resumes. Also check out YC company job boards, reach out directly to CTOs on Twitter, and honestly just cold email smaller companies whose products you actually use.Project-wise, forget the typical todo apps everyone builds. Since you have an EE background, build something that bridges that gap. Maybe a tool that visualizes electrical circuit data, or automates some workflow you know engineers deal with. About internships, unpaid ones are tricky legally in most places, but if its a legit startup where you're learning tons and building real features, it might be worth it short-term. Just make sure you're not just doing grunt work.One thing we see at Metana with career switchers like yourself, the ones who get hired fastest are those who can tell a compelling story about why they switched and what unique perspective they bring. Your EE background plus Python skills is actually a rare combo that certain companies really need.Also, don't wait until you feel \"ready\" to start applying. You'll learn more from a few rejections and interviews than another month of tutorials. Companies can teach you their specific stack, but they cant teach you how to think through problems, which you already know how to do.",

Depends on the login it can get harder or just *EZ* as fuck.

With ***NODEJS*** you can use **node-cron**, and it looks like this:`cron.schedule('0 8 * * *', () => {``console.log('Running scraping task at 8:00 AM every day');`By the way, if you are using *Ubuntu*, you can check *Crontab* and take a look at it, cos it's pretty similar. Is the way *Ubuntu* schedule tasks for the *OS* (and you can schedule some scripts in Ubuntu's crontab, I did one for example to always commit something to Github once a day).It's been a long time since I \"scrap\" a website, but I still think I can give it a try again. If you need some examples with *Node*, just tell me and I'll link the ones on my *Github*.Hope it helps.",

The 2008 Financial Crisis caused a 2nd \"bubble burst\".Go into CS because you enjoy it, but don't forget that the reason we get paid well is because not too many of us enrolled in Computer Science because so many people thought the bubble was bursting.Computation isn't going anywhere. The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades. AI will not replace programmers any time soon (in fact, it's becoming clear that it enables more modalities for computation and we'll need more).It's silly to me that we jump right to the notion of AI replacing programmers and don't discuss all of the types of jobs that use a subset of the total skills required to be a good software engineer.Logically, before you see a programmer wholesale replaced you'd have to see Translators/Court Stenographers/Draftsmen/Accountants replaced. They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).There are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.It stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output? You need LLMs to produce code that works 99%+ of the time, out of the gate, to hope to replace us, and/or have an extremely robust system of feedback loops plumbed back into the LLM with 0% hallucination. We're nowhere near that.I love LLMs in my own workflows, but it takes my experience to get the LLM on the right track even on small workflows. Even with specificity, I'd estimate that the LLM gets it right way less than 30% of the time, and it's my ability to debug and suggest fixes is what gets me to working solution.",

Because the way this society is going, you're going to need a financial safety net larger than you're thinking right now. The societal safety nets are disappearing.If anything happens to you and your capacity to bring in money, you're going to wish you had enough money such that your *money* generates money -- i.e., investments so large that you can live off the interest alone. And you're not going to have the leftover funds to invest with an average salary if you're ever laid off, get sick, get into a car accident, etc.Most of those people whose jobs you're eying won't be able to financially recover from a bad diagnosis, let alone retire.Think back to when you were in college and money was tight. That's going to be your life without a good income. You just forgot what that's like.If you don't hear anything else I'm saying, just remember that you can always find ways to socialize and engage with your interests with a high salary. But a low salary is a limiting factor that puts hard a ceiling on every other aspect of your life. And I truly believe a person's earning power is the single hardest thing to change in life. So hard, in fact, that most people never do it.Only quit your current line of work at your current company if you just can't stand to do it anymore and it makes you absolutely miserable. I'm talking, you *dread* getting up in the morning and your evenings are spent agonizing about having to go back to work the next day. To the point where the dread consumes you and it becomes your whole life.Beyond that, consider yourself lucky to be able to do what you do, for the salary you do it at.**Edit:** If you really don't want to do that kind of work long term, the best thing you can do is look into FIRE-ing and retire early. You have the salary to do that and do it comfortably. But your friends with low salaries would have to live like literal paupers to do even half of that. I'm talking worse than you lived when money was tight in college.",

In order to do that, they paid out all the accrued PTO we had all gained. It actually worked in my benefit, I still was able to take the same amount of vacation I otherwise would've, but I had already accrued a bunch which they had to buy out, so I got a nice fat bonus.Even if your husband's in a State that doesn't require a company to do that, they *might* still do it anyways to keep people happy.

Facebook, Twitter, Google isn't exactly sharing that what I can imagine is slightly better maintainable code to be ingested by AI. So yeah, the code we are getting from AI is equivalent to a fresh grad making a capstone project. Yeah there's good repos out there with open source projects, but LLMs cannot tell what is good code from bad code. The majority wins. And do we think most of the code out there is good?God, I just imagine some poor soul has consumed some manifestation of my public repo made 10 years ago and shudder.",

The models will never be perfect, but if we allow LLMs to indiscriminately consume any and all information, it's going to results in an endless feedback loop of robots talking to robots, eating each others' shit and feeding us the same... the current generation is is already trending towards lacking the skills to produce something on their own. Ive noticed that my own reliance on llms have watered down my skills and I've gone back to using Google (but it's so hard not to fall into the temptation of easy answers)On the flip side of this, picking and choosing the content for an LLM can be equally as damaging.

Cue them emailing to me on Friday at 4pm, giving me exactly three days to complete it. Worked through the weekend, completed it in depth, nothing after that. It was absolutely not anything that could be used as \"free work\" either - it was simply a time-consuming bootcamp-level web project that took about 10 hours.All I can say is - ignore all the snobs in this thread criticizing you for agreeing to hop to a take-home assignment at all.

        "body": "Go for it. IMO the toxicity of Meta is overstated on places like Blind, and Google's culture is worse than it used to be. It's true that Meta is overall more \"intense\" but what this really means is that people don't coast. Getting high ratings and raises is very doable, which is why everyone is trying to do it, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The E4 -> E5 promotion is probably easier to get at Meta.The biggest differences in my mind are:1. Meta is more customer metrics driven; a good project is a project that made the numbers go up. Whereas Google is more focused on alignment: if the senior engineers agreed your design was good, and your leadership thought it was a good idea, and you executed it well, then it was a good project regardless of what happens after. On the positive side, this means that at Google you can spend more of your time on risky, speculative things; at Meta you have to think about your time more like an investment portfolio, with some things you're pretty sure will pay off to \"fund\" your riskier ideas. On the negative side, as you advance in your career at Google you have to spend more of your time sucking up to leadership, because there is no objective way to determine whether your projects were good so it is more of a popularity contest.2. Google has better engineering practices, infrastructure, and documentation. This follows from Meta being an entertainment company; Instagram users will come back even if the app crashes sometimes, but Google Cloud customers wouldn't tolerate this. Things break pretty often at Meta. The downside of this is that you spend more time firefighting during oncall. The upside is that it's much easier to ship things. Code and design reviews are less nitpicky and there are fewer barriers to just doing things. It does mean that more knowledge at Meta is in people's heads rather than written down, so you have to build out a network of experts. There is more chatter and context switching as a result, although overall there are fewer meetings which is nice.If you were someone who disliked the bureaucracy at Google, Meta will be a good change of pace. They are both good companies to work at, it's all about what you value.",

At least that's the workflow I've seen from people working in Data Engineering and Data Science.>\\[...\\] but I still think SWEs will still need to serve as an \"architect\" for the AI while the AI takes the role of the \"construction worker\" or \"builder\". This all depends on if the whole \"trust in the trend\" holds out or not. Today's AI models just scaled up and made cheaper won't replace software engineers.",

AI takes on large amounts of technical debt, but (hopefully) makes it much easier to pay off this debt.My manager handed me off a project that started as a vibe coding session. Basically they have no clue why everything is falling apart, so they created a dashboard to gain observability into service outages.This dashboard is an Azure workbook with heavy UI elements that was created in the portal (browser GUI) and they decided they want this converted into code and deployed via CI/CD. Let's have Chad Jebity do it!The result was this very large codebase that essentially creates deployment stages for every workbook that gets added into the pipeline and it iterates through a list to populate the data. It literally takes 20-30 minutes for me to run the pipeline and validate a change that usually takes 1 click in the browser.I've been trying to explain to them that this won't scale and will eventually have to get replaced, but trying to get them to understand Big O notation was like drawing blood from a stone. I've realized life is much easier if I just go with the flow and use those 30 minute pipeline runs as a break to focus on sharpening my own axe.",

At best I'll ask it to give me some options for a problem and I'll adapt its solution to my needs.

For me I think what i've really grown to enjoy is just continuing to use Neovim with CoPilot completions and a CLI based agent. I find the CLI based agents really solid for querying my code base about something I might want to do, and when the task is small enough that the CLI can spin up something that I can read in a few seconds to determine if it's correct. But I found that \\_miromanaging\\_ the agent in Cursor is really just not how I want to develop with AI on a daily basis. It doesn't bring me joy, and if it doesn't bring me joy, my work is going to suffer and bugs will slip through. I'm not afraid of the vibe coding revolution tbh, the only thing I am sort of concerned about is that organizations might start demanding certain text editors as mandatory.",

And yet these solutions are repeatedly discovered to be aggravatingly restricting on what they allow you to achieve and fall way short of enterprise level software development. And the results are mediocre.No-code & AI promise similar things, and that is the removal of expensive skilled labor.But if \"anyone\" can do it, how much of a market edge can you really achieve? What value do you have to offer as a competitive edge if someone else can come along and vibe code a better version of your product in a week?CEOs forget, they don't hire software developers because they can do repeatative tasks, as if it's just data entry. Recruiters call them \"talent\" for a reason.This is a note to aspiring devs as well. Don't be a robot. Anyone can learn to code.

CEO figures to cut the recurring maintenance cost of the third party product and your boss has said they can build an in-house tool that will be just as effective. On point 1 you should be aware that regulators regularly share findings with each other.

The Board should have a Board Member responsible for Compliance / Audit. If you can identify that person you could send an anonymous email cc'ing the Board Chair as well asking whether they were aware that email monitoring was being discontinued.

Under that perspective, there's a minimal set of things you need to do in order to do that job. Most of development planning I do, is figuring out what is that minimal set of things we need in order for the app or whatever to be successful.The difficult thing about software, and what will take years to learn, is to understand the tradeoff space between doing something fast that quickly solves a problem but might have a lot of tech debt, and taking more time to do something right, and having less tech debt or ongoing costs.

        "body": "Before you entirely abandon this field, here are some things that might help.1,000 applications is intense. But applying online is also a saturated channel and an increasingly inefficient one. In the past 3 years, a bunch of recruiters got laid off, and according to our data, there are about 3X fewer recruiters working now than there were in the first half of 2022.At the same time, the number of (non-spam) applicants for eng jobs has 3X'ed since the first half of 2022. I don't have numbers for how many spam applications companies are getting, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's probably another 3-5X increase.So, recruiters are maybe 30-50X less productive than they were a couple of years ago. Which, for you, means that applying online isn't the best approach.Before you completely give up and switch to a field that takes over 10 years to start making money, try doing outreach instead. You can give yourself a deadline. Something like, \"If I can't get some responses by January 2026, I'm going to med school.\" And until then, I'd focus on trying to get in the door.So, what to do? I'm one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We have a whole chapter on how to do outreach that includes some templates, and it's free: [https://bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters) It's the first document, and just go to Chapter 7: Getting in the Door.When you do your outreach, in the part of the template where you should mention something unique about you, try writing about how you were able to automate your job. I bet it's a good story.Finally, if you post a link to your resume/LinkedIn in a response to this comment, I'd be happy to review and share some notes. That said, you (and others in your shoes) probably don't need to spend lots of time on your resumes because recruiters typically scan them for brands, and either you have them or you don't. Anyone who tells you to spend a lot of time polishing your resume is probably selling snake oil.",

There's a lot of talk about tech being a boom-and-bust industry, but even to an experienced tech exec nowadays they've seen three busts:1. Dot com2. Great Recession3. TodayThe difference with the first two is that tech (and especially web-based software + SaaS) has grown its talent pool significantly since 2008. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Once companies set in these Three Horsemen of the (Tech) Apocalypse (RTO, Offshoring, and Stack Ranking), those companies in the past would be seen as \"failing\" culturewise. However, in 2023-2025 the normal cycle of job changing was disrupted, so you have a lot of built-up dissatisfaction from people who want to change jobs, but can't find new opportunities. When opportunities arise at these companies with those qualities, the new folks may be arriving from something that was an even worse dumpster fire. A good example is GEICO. They fired swaths of their IT/SWE and have a 2.6 on Glassdoor. They are pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as large companies. However, if someone was working at Geico and transitioned into something like Amazon, they might find it a breath of fresh air.The real problem at the end of the day is an oversupply of engineers. Fix the problem at the source and reduce enrollments.",

Every single billionaire you read about on the news would trade every penny they have just to be 21 again(remember that whenever you read about one), not to mention pretty much everyone else.To answer your question - > Do I transition to blue-collar work?Sure. Or retail. Or dishwashing. Or *anything*, because you've got *years* ahead of you where the world has absolutely no expectations for you to do anything more. Hell, you can spend another 3-4 years getting a whole second degree in something else if you want, and still be the same age as most of the student body(again, priceless).21-with-a-degree-and-no-debt is the most future any adult can possible have.

Some people took advantage of me, but I also made good friends who realized I would be a lot more useful over time if they treated me maps,Some percentage of those people will suck and some percentage will be great, and different ways you can swtup that funnel have different proportions. Eventually, you end up with a network of good people.The more you have to offer, and the more unique it is, the better your conversion rate will be if you just cold message interesting people offering to work together. Probably the absolute peak for you would be on projects that are both tech products and can use your aviation background.",

People can be really full of it, and that's not fun. My recommendation is to find an open source project that aligns with your interest and try to make ANY contribution and become part of it. It can be super small contributions, as long as you're addressing a problem, work well with others, document cleanly, etc. As you do that you're going to meet people just by working. And you'll earn trust and build a role in a community from a really meaningful angle.You don't need anyone's permission to *build* the type of community engagement you crave. I believe in you!",

Side projects are very important and it shows that you enjoy / are interested in CS. Speaking of, make sure before you go to school for CS I highly recommend doing some self learning and make something small. I know a lot of people who go to school for CS, spend the money and realize they don't like it mid-degree and switch OR even worse get their whole degree and not like to code. Make sure when selecting your major you aren't just picking something that \"makes a lot of money\" but also consider what you think is interesting. Then consider how you get there, and in many many cases you don't need a degree depending on what you decide. The last advice I'll give is that college is always there. I get the impression you're younger, and from experience I think going to college right after high-school is one of the worst things about society. In the past going to college and \"figuring things out\" wasn't a big deal because it was priced very very differently. Now due to the cost of most colleges I'd rather recommend a new high school grad to spend time working and looking into career fields they find interesting. Then reach out and find people doing those things and see if you can find someone who will help answer any questions about what its actually like doing those things and the day-to-day.",

AI is a set of tools that can be used to expedite work and outsourcing is always going to be around in either consultants for specialty work or delegation to remove simple processes to keep costs down. Re- outsourcing Outsourcing or delegation of labor has been around for my entire career. Firms tend to dabble in an effort to think they cs save money and that staff are fungible. What’s not fungible is learning and understanding of vestigial projects. Where outsourcing works is when the team is seen as another dev group and can solve projects entirely on their own without constant supervision from home office because staff have relocated there and the firm is invested for the indefinite future. Otherwise it’s executives dabbling with consulting groups that fail because they need to call in more staff to do what is being asked or write better requirements. Re - AI Just another set of tools that really depend on where they are sourcing more than anything else. Think of moving from paper to a computer in the 70s to do bookkeeping. The general ledger was a legit book where inflows and outflows were recorded. I worked on wall street where funds would calculate their values and holdings at the end of day by hand. Think of a circular saw , if you don’t know how to cut 4x8 sheet of plywood well your just going to do it faster than a handsaw. Same deal with a car - it’s great you can drive it but if you don’t have a general clue of where you’re going you are going to go somewhere quickly.

This guy was a higher level engineer who basically developed everything and went out of his way to make the code 100x better and refactored. But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.One time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.I saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy. It definetley was the beginning of the end when that one higher level engineer. I dont regret it I tried respecting my work life balance and I knew early on the job wasnt for me.",

You say he is emphasizing your “poor work”, is your work actually poor? Did you get comments from senior engineers before you started coding? It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future. I would also think carefully about what this person is likely to respond positively to if you want a positive outcome, much depends on the individual here.3. If they are being really obnoxious and unhelpful, you could always just tell your manager, and possibly start disregarding the more persnickety comments. You should be very sure though that you’re delivering good quality work and management have your back. This is difficult if you don’t have rank though.Other than that, there’s not much else you can do.",

Sure - after ten minutes of inactivity it would save changes and close. But, one of the managers totally screwed up their edits and those changes were saved.So I was asked if I could prompt user to see if they wanted changes saved or not, before auto-closing due to inactivity. I pointed out that that would defeat the entire purpose of automatically closing it because, you know, *they’d walked away from it*. So I was told to auto close it *without* saving - except next I was told that on the first business day of the month, some of the managers entered data and would sometimes have it opened but inactive for more than ten minutes while they were working on it, and one had just lost their desired changes. So could I have it auto-close after ten minutes of inactivity, without saving, unless it was the first business day of the month, in which case I should auto-close but save it first?An. Excel. Workbook. I had actual real work to do. I did it - I also got told I was being “difficult” when I asked if the managers could just be told to *close the damned workbook when they were done using it*.",

We also don't have many hard deadlines unless we need to meet new legal standards. This means there's no pressure when it comes to using our (rather generous) PTO and that time actually gets deducted from our expected work output. I literally never work more than 40hrs per week unless I choose to crunch something for my own peace of mind. I only go to the office two days a week.If you're willing to take a pay cut, I'd look for smaller companies like this. The salary isn't super competitive, but the rest of our benefits are great, the culture is super relaxed, and the WLB is on point.Granted, this is only my second job, and it's my first job in tech. A lot of people tell me I found a unicorn, but then a lot of other people tell me this is pretty normal for small tech organizations.",

        "body": "The best job I ever got came after a similar kind of interview—to the point where I thought \"okay, I'm ready to schedule the *real* interview\" and they gave me an offer instead. And this was at Target, not some tiny startup!But after that I got really interesting, researchy work, lots of space to learn (I was building a new supply chain optimization system, but I didn't have any operations research background starting out!) and a ton of flexibility, scope and autonomy. I know lots of teams that have much \"harder\" interviews but then the actual role turns into just doing dull, bite-sized tickets assigned by somebody else.So my only conclusion is that a team's hiring practices are, at most, a relatively weak signal about the team culture and the nature of the work.I would not try to draw any strong conclusions from your hiring experience. Instead, I'd try talking to the hiring manager, talking to somebody on the team and asking questions to understand the day-to-day experience as well as the broader context around the team and the work. This isn't full-proof—I just left a miserable role at a company despite talking to multiple past coworkers who seemed happy there—but, with social questions, *nothing* is fool-proof. So I just try to get the best impression I can, but also remember that all sorts of things can happen.",

After recognizing that, it's basic unwanted emotion management: Acknowledge the feeling and what it's telling you (this job is important to you), then let it go. I find once I'm in flow, I'm fine, so it's just getting over that initial hump that takes effort. You may have to try a few times to get past the feeling. It's ok if this is difficult at first. This is an important soft skill, and like all skills, it takes practice.In my experience, it's actually really rare to be fired for performance unless you do like, literally nothing for months. Usually it's some political game happening 3 levels above you that you have no control over, and performance is just the excuse they use to justify someone sacrificing their pawn to take a rook. I have seen so many amazing engineers get fired for \"performance\" who were certainly out performing me.The best way to protect yourself is to just be reliable, and get your work done. You can't hit your target if you're watching everyone else draw their bow.~ Sincerely, a FAANG worker that has survived 3 layoffs (and probably a fourth, soon :grimacing_face:)P.S.: there are two books that may help, though I've never read them.

I know somebody who spent 2 months at work before he was given anything to do aside from trainings. That was partially because it was a job at a bank and there was a lot of red tape, but also...just a super awful onboarding process.I just started a job recently, and my onboarding was kind of a mess too. HR person was on PTO and nobody picked up the slack. My manager eventually messaged me halfway through the day, but I had next-to-no guidance my first week. I just sorted my system out and noodled around company docs. Fortunately it's a remote position, so I just got to hang out and play videogames in the dead space. Not as much fun to do nothing all day when it's onsite. Sorry homie.It sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'd ping your manager again just to check in and see where things are at, but not in a *needy* way. Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it. Not a great move to annoy your manager on your first week, but it is still their job to...do something. Or at least let you know that this is how onboarding always goes.> he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guideThis is the one thing that hits me weird. Was it *actually* 3 minutes? Not even 10? That's an alarmingly short intro call. If that's the case, I'd be prepared for him to be a very dont-give-a-fuck sort of manager. Ideally, that means your work life is chill, and not that everything is a scramble and you look bad because your manager doesn't do their side and throws you under the bus after the fact.I wouldn't sweat it yet, but there are a ton of managers out there who...need to be managed.",

To a person, a lot of bad, bad things happened to them, and the sacrifice including their lives, their mental and physical well being, and years of time. You may be too young to remember war, but we've done it, and we'll likely do it again, so I sort of agree with your Dad: not worth the risk.You might be a little bit better than my friends (mostly ground pounders or support during the Iraq surge), but even \"smart\" veterans who end up at fancy language schools and in the drone program have incredibly high rates of PTSD and all sorts of other problems.If it's the absolute last option, and you get a good MOS, there are clear benefits: like a great social welfare program for veterans that includes healthcare and other entitlements, and maybe some skills in a specialized area that can apply to cyber security. That said, the military is no jobs program, when in you exist to serve, and that service is a sacrifice. If you want to fight, if you want to serve, do it, otherwise, you could easily end up worse off where you are today, in ways that will be difficult for you to imagine right now.Therefore, you need to try harder to make what you have now work. Expand your job search, hit pavement, look for roles outside of CS, be willing to move. You gotta hustle, and one way or another that's going to require a bunch more work that you are currently doing. Good luck!",

As an institution, they don't really act with the best interests of their employees at heart. You give up a lot of your freedom and rights when you enlist.

If you do it solely for your own career and everyone/thing comes second, life will suck for others, and as I've seen personally, men will die. If you do that, fuck you.2. There's lots of roles related to this field, particularly in the AF. Look into those.3. If you do it, and serve honorably, you will not regret it. Of all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there was a lot of ugly, it's the greatest point of pride in my life and I'm thankful every day that I did it. I gained so much, both materially and non-material. 4. Talk to actual vets/actives about it. Do NOT listen to anyone here who did not serve. My DMs are open. I was USMC infantry, but I have a lot of connections across fields and branches.5. It WILL help you in the job market. Good vets that get and into stem out have a great reputation of working hard, thinking critically, and being able to work under pressure. I was asked a lot in interviews about how my prior service related to my think critically and problem solve, as well as leadership roles. I always tied it into technical projects in college, but it gives you a fat jump in the game.",

I’ve long said that I think tech lead is the absolute worst job you can have and I think that that often falls right in line with this.The problem is that you’re still expected to contribute code like any other engineer, but you start taking on more project management responsibilities that require heavy context switching. You end up doing 70% of two jobs that require very different skill sets and I think the only way most people manage is to put in extra hours.Once you’re beyond that level, I think your WLB actually starts to get easier because you’re no longer expected to write as much code. The problems you focus on are harder, but you have the ability to make more time to think on and you’re able to step away from the day to day work more.So yeah, I guess my point is that I think to get to any level above senior, you likely have to push through a few years of shit WLB, but beyond the senior level it actually starts to get better and not worse.",

This is for multiple (usually two) teams concurrently. I am there to spot opportunities for collaboration and leverage, find different solutions to problems, to nudge people to think about different approaches. Sometimes I fill in most of the duties of a tech lead if someone is out.Part of the reason I do a bit of everything is that I have been promoted three times in seat. I am sure it would feel different joining a team as above-senior rather than previously having been in the lower roles on the same team. It's not like I'm going to refuse to do the things I did before, if there is an urgent need. It's just that normally there are other people to delegate to.Because I don't really hold any primary accountability for anything and have had managers largely leave me to do as I see fit, it doesn't come with much stress.

And I did get a lot done. But the key thing is that my day-to-day was flexible, so I could adjust what I was doing and how hard I was working based on circumstances or even just based on how I was feeling. I got a lot done by doing high-leverage work and figuring out more effective ways to achieve my high-level aims rather than working long hours.But that only worked because my manager was willing to trust me to make real decisions not just about how I was working day-to-day but also about what I was doing. I could go out, talk to people, understand their actual constraints and the interaction points between my system and other teams, then scope my work based on that rather than aiming for arbitrary deadlines or roadmaps. When you have the ability to just solve real problems rather than chasing output for the sake of output—and when nobody is trying to optimize your \"capacity\"—you can get a lot done without working crazy hours or burning out.On the other hand, there are lots of teams and managers that do not operate like that. I've seen company planning processes that were clearly designed to put lots of artificial pressure on people and in those situations, yeah, a higher level role might be more stressful than a lower-level role. But even at those companies, at some point, you'll only be able to perform at a given level by doing high-leverage work rather than just working harder, so, if you don't burn out along the way, you'll learn how to have a large impact with reasonable(ish) effort.",

That makes me less visible during big events so it slows down my progress but I’ve done enough of the “hero” thing in the past that I don’t care to do it again regularly but can of needed. I’ve also switched into management which required a lot more after hours work than when I was in hero mode, and it was less fun, so I switched back.So no it doesn’t require more time investment while being above senior level but you need to pace yourself to find the correct balance to get there.",

Is working a LITTLE MORE than 40 \"killing yourself?\"I'm not software but I am a senior engineer of a different discipline in a different industry (chemical engineer, at EPC), and if someone was only ever \"working\" 9 to 5, we'd be suspicious that they were working sub 40 hours a week, 35-40 ish. Given we \"bill\" every hour because we have to invoice and get paid for our designs by clients who want them, 40 hours on your time sheet means 40 hours of work. Not... 35 + paid lunch. You can and will get fired for that. You're free to report 35 + 5 hours OH, but people would ask why this is the case. I am positive I will be techsplained how software is different (yes I am aware, this isn't the point here).Not to get all Office Space Stan on people, but doing the bare minimum with respect to anything generally does not get you ahead. 9 to 5 and anything more being \"killing myself\" really sounds like 15 pieces of flare and no more. This isn't going to be rewarded, and it can be difficult to make a lasting impact if the bare minimum is all you're willing to do.It might be different in software, but senior around my parts implies a willingness to put in the work / time / hours when it is necessary. Projects succeed or fail on the willingness of the senior leadership corps to do what is necessary. Seniors are the critical force that holds the project together, that is their impact. After that, whether or not you experienced WLB during this time frame will be by how well a project is run, project schedule, how well defined a project is... all of which conspire to define how crazy a project is.For your case, it REALLY sounds like if you want that high TC, senior title, with ability to make impact, you're GOING to need to make peace with high pressure and hectic environments, and then critically, be willing to put in the time when it is necessary. So if your current work DOESN'T require this extra time and extra availability, then you're likely golden. Keep on going on. However, are your coworkers experiencing stress, working early, working late, to get things done while you're over here working 9 to 5? Are you complaining openly any time work requires deviation from this (don't do this if you are)? If you're working 9 to 5 while everyone else is working 7 - 6 and drowning... then you're NOT going to get senior there. You're NOT in the trenches with your team. You'll have to quit and get hired as senior somewhere else (good luck with that in this environment).For reference here... \"Projects\" I work on are 1.5 to 2 year affairs, the larger of which can easily be 1000-1250 FTE for factories/sites that can run 20-25 billion once tools are put in, with base infrastructure being between ~5-8 billion. Error bars on these projects exceed the total cost of other megaprojects. So these are huge... long affairs, involving many people. My point is, that for the longer durations on this, they look and feel a lot more like traditional work. People will remember if you put the bare minimum in or not and if the project suffered because people didn't go above and beyond.For context, I am currently on a mega project, we can't add anymore staff because we don't have any, and the project would benefit GREATLY from 45-50 hour weeks out of our junior engineering core for a month or three to get caught up. A few are doing this, and their scope situation is improving, but several others are not, and they're behind. Whether or not this is recoverable, is an interesting question. I'm not lead here... thankfully. So we have this weird situation where everyone is drowning short term, and the group is splitting into people who make an effort, and people who do the bare minimum. The career consequences of which won't be felt for years. For what it is worth, engineering staff gets straight time OT on billed work, so 60 hours means a 50% increase. It's our bonus structure to reward additional work.",

Because those roles are rigorous and always in high demand unlike most of the “full stack” javascript slop. Once you familiarize yourself with the shiny new tech stacks and do some leetcode grind, you might have an easier time doing personalized outreach to well funded startups in your area of expertise (cold dms to the founders/ctos, tapping into your network for intros etc) vs applying for roles via recruiters at a mid-large corporations that are currently on a hiring freeze or find your gap a bit too much of a red flag. I’ve worked at 3 different startups and “guy pivoting careers from physics to programming” or “guy coming back to work after a 2 year parental leave” weren’t uncommon archetypes, they only care about you moving quickly and getting shit done. Once you do a year or so at a startup doing some generalist work, you can go back to whatever role or company that appeals best to you without worrying about the gap. I do have some doubts on whether grad school is the move though, you’ll be burning way too much money in tuition + it’ll keep you occupied and away from full time work (on top of your 2-3 year gap) = all for very little marginal gains.Also, take most of the advice from this subreddit with a grain of salt, it mostly self-selects for unemployed new grads who complain about how the job market is impossible (yes it is definitely harder but not remotely “give up and find a different career” hard, if you’ve some experience under the belt)",

They all say the same thing. \"CC is not where we look for potential interns\". Plus, it could be weighing you down in ATS systems as a person with 2 sections of education instead of 1. Also, try to network. UCSD has a lot of students that will be going to big firms come this summer, and many of them will get full time offers. Being friends with those people will help a ton.Finally, you do have an internship. That research internship is something you can present as evidence that you are employable.Finally, I would wonder why you haven't taken any courses on things like OS, compilers, databases, etc. You know, core CS stuff. That might be something an employer might wonder too, why all your coursework is solely focused on Ai and ML. As for the job search, I'm left wondering how exactly you went about that. Like, did you spend a lot of your time on LinkedIn? Handshake? In person recruiting events? Direct company applications? Indeed? There is some statistical evidence suggesting that some of these lead to jobs at higher rates than others(LinkedIn sucks for this, while Handshake and in person are a lot better).",

All too often LinkedIn has recommended me jobs that were terrible fits for me, but after going to the company's page, I found postings that were a perfect fit that LinkedIn's shitty algorithm hid from me. Or a post that is still open on LinkedIn, might be closed on the company's careers page because they just neglected to update LinkedIn.

You don't always need to be working on stuff, sometimes it's good to talk with others and better understand what others are doing and how the business works. I regularly reach out to people, even people I have never met in person. It has worked out well and management really likes it as well since it gives their projects more visibility.**Short answer to your original question**: a recruiter reached out for a job below my skillset which accidentally lead me to getting an internal promotion to a software engineer, which wasn't my initial intended career path, but I am so glad I kept an open mind when taking the initial job",

Most companies wouldn't even let a junior dev talk to clients without supervision, let alone own the entire relationship.I've seen this pattern before. Companies dump everything on whoever's willing to take it, especially if you came from QA and they think you \"understand the business better.\" But just because you CAN do all this doesn't mean you should.You're not crazy. This is definitely too much for a junior role. Either push back and ask for support, or start looking elsewhere.

That’s not some big secret to your employer. They know you are still finding your way. And that takes time. But you have to be proactive and learn. The fact that you feel the need to constantly ask questions is good! Someone who doesn’t care to learn would not ask for help. Schedule 30 minute meetings with the people in your team and learn about them. What was their journey? What is there specific role in the grand equation? What about your manager? What’s their perspective of what the team does? Are there specific skills in tech you want to learn more about? Find people you work with and pry them for information.See something you learn pretty quick is that people love flattery. And nothing is more flattering than having a young twenty-something come up to you and ask you “How did you do it?”",

A very fast promotion to senior would be 5 years. I've seen many people that were very good in their role take 10+ years to make Senior. I wouldn't worry that much about it. Keep working hard and keep asking your manager for bigger projects.Also, enjoy this time because eventually you are going to miss it. Your job is low stress, nobody is really counting on you for anything, and you have free time. This will not last forever, you will have deadlines, many of them will be unreasonable. You will be asked to make hard decisions and then people will bitch and complain about it you for years afterwards when it doesn't work out. People will want things from you. Nonstop. You will have meetings, hours of them every day. Even outside of meetings people will want things from you.

You're trying to do everything at once and that's why you're advancing slow. Pick one thing and go deep for like 2-3 months. I'd suggest focusing on system design first since that's what'll get you to senior architect roles fastest.But something most people miss is that you can actually grow within your current crappy role. Those support tickets? Start asking why they're happening. Is it bad error handling? Poor user experience? Scaling issues? Then propose solutions during team meetings. Even if they don't implement them, you're thinking like a senior engineer.Document everything you fix and the impact. \"Fixed authentication bug that was affecting 15% of users\" sounds way better than \"did support tickets\" on your resume.Also, start a side project that mirrors what you wish you were doing at work. Build something that scales, implement proper architecture, use modern patterns. This gives you real talking points in interviews.The leetcode grind is overrated unless you're targeting FAANG. Focus on building stuff and understanding systems.One more thing. Networking matters more than people think. We see this all the time at Metana with our bootcamp grads. The ones who connect with other developers, join communities, contribute to open source... they level up way faster than the ones just grinding tutorials alone.You've got this, just need to be more strategic about where you spend that energy. Stop trying to learn everything and start building something real:)Your current job sucks but it's temporary. Use it as a stepping stone while you build the portfolio that gets you out.",

The less they need to critically think about the grading criteria the better in my opinion. You need to advocate for yourself, in all facets of life, because it is very unlikely that others will do it for you.If you haven't done so, start keeping track of accomplishments throughout the year which you can point to as justifications for your rating. Even if they're small.I've even at times flat out said in my comments that I perhaps don't fully deserve the rating of 5, but since I felt I was on the cusp, I gave myself the nod because I need to advocate for myself.

If the subject is making you go 'meh' in the first year, then it's hard to say what'll make you go from meh to 'wow yes' in future years.When I took CS, I was super engrossed and enamored by my classes. While not every student will be quite like it, you probably need more than \"I've grown disinterested\". My guess is your use of the online tools let you squeek by without understanding the material, which has done you a massive disservice.This degree isn't for everyone. If your next best option is history or polisci, I'd say you took CS because of the memes, not because of the interest or ability. For example, if I had to drop out of CS, I probably would have taken something in the sciences, like physics, engineering, etc.",

Regardless of what path you go down, I feel like I should also add that a Political Science degree isn’t worth much if you don’t plan on going to law school. You can absolutely find work with it or a History degree, but it’s not gonna pay as well as CS related jobs would. I’m not saying stay in it for the money, but it’s something to keep in mind when choosing another major.",

If you use it properly it'll make you a lot faster, and you'll also learn a lot as long as you aren't blindly copying everything it spits out.",

It doesn't mean that if you force yourself to present, one day all your anxiety and stage fright magically goes away and suddenly you're a pro presenter.It means that the more you do it, the easier that anxiety becomes to manage, and the less it impacts your ability to present. The anxiety's still there. It'll probably *always* be there. You're not going to \"get over\" it. But you will absolutely become better at managing it.I also hate presenting. I've always been uncomfortable with it. In college, and early in my career, the anxiety would really get to me. The anxiety would hit me so hard I can feel my voice straight up changing, dry mouth, stuttering, stumbling over my words, rushing, I start sweating, if it's bad enough I'll be shaking like a leaf.With years and years of on-the-job practice in the *professional* world, that anxiety slowly became more and more manageable. I think maybe 4 or 5 years into my career is when it became so manageable I started considering myself a *good* presenter.For example, not long after I started at my current job, I got the chance to present a demo of a new feature to all of our stakeholders. It was a very not-casual call with 50+ people on it. I crushed it, I spoke slowly and clearly, I communicated my points well, it went great. I got multiple comments, and even a formal email to my manager, mentioning how great of a demo was, specifically calling out how well I presented it.The anxiety was absolutely still there. Tons of it. Leading up to, during, and afterwards. But, at this point in my career, I can manage it to a point where it doesn't impact my ability to do an amazing presentation, it's not showing through my voice, or stuttering, or shaking anymore. I'm able to keep it mostly internal. Everything that goes into presentations today are very much leaned behaviors that come from practice.Presenting is going to be a very important part of your career. It gets even more important as you gain seniority, you're not going to be able to pawn that responsibility off for your whole career. Do the presentation. Keep doing them. It will get better. I'm living proof.",

Mid-demo the box froze. Without missing a beat, the demo guy, a 5.5 ft tall Indian version of Tom Cruise with similar steel nerves, pulls out the USB drive, inserts to the box debug port as the unit is rebooting, reprograms the unit in front of the CEO all while explaining that the unit is field upgradeable via USB. Unit reboots as expected and demo is great. The guy is now VP engineering for a major tech firm. You don't need to be able to do that but an internal demo should be easy enough to start.",

Regrettably, the way I framed these tested rote memorization of keywords rather than understanding of core concepts- Questions that verify you understand environment variables and why they’re used for passing secrets to a program- basic Linux questions based around things I’ve had to do on the jobThe other interviewer asked questions about:- knowledge of the types available in Python,- knowledge about the type returned (tuple) when you put something like “return a,b”- the difference between a list and a tupleFor the coding portion we just asked them to return the string that appears the most within a list.——That all being said, my company is pretty laid back and doesn’t pay nearly enough for us to be asking leetcode type stuff. Other companies may take differing approaches toward interviews for their entry levels.——For those interested in how I’m planning on asking SQL questions in the future, I plan on writing some example SQL code ahead of time and just asking them to explain what it’s doing.That way I’m testing the ability to understand SQL rather than rote memorization.——",

Funny enough, I could not remember the keyword name at that moment but knew there was functionality for it. The OFFSET keyword.

These keywords were the ones I found myself using most frequently.Moving forward I plan on showing them queries with these keywords in them and asking them to explain to me what it’s doing, since the ability to understand an SQL query is a lot more valuable than rote memorization of keywords.",

The AI does it at $3/task.One day, we hear about another CEO who wants to “streamline” and cut junior roles, the next day, we are told to “stop panicking”, all while every junior I know is 200 applications deep with a few phone calls to show for it.I’m not denying that tech hasn’t been bad before, but for the first time ever, this doesn’t feel cyclical. It doesn’t feel like we gotta just “hold on until the market stabilizes”, it truly feels like there IS a replacement, there IS genuinely a reason to not hire juniors. Let’s say juniors do break into the market. It takes 2-3 years to move from entry level roles to mid level roles for most people. Where will AI be in 2-3 years? Even if we get in to the disappearing junior roles, I feel like it’s going to be the same uphill battle moving forward, AI won’t stop advancing unless we hit a wall. With each step up the AI ladder, the market is flooded with more and more people who can all work down (think seniors applying to mid level roles), so the people at the bottom (us) will be FUCKED.This is all just my opinion based on what I’ve seen though, maybe there’s something I’m not seeing.

Employers are expecting devs to be fully knowledgeable of their tools and languages, but also to use AI to quadruple their output. Except, when you begin learning this stuff in 2025, it’s very difficult to force yourself not to use AI every time you get stuck, especially when your employer is expecting you to and their deadlines reflect that.Truly understanding programming comes from writing your own code from scratch, running into problems, and spending hours and hours nearly ripping your hair out trying to fix it. You can use AI to help understand small bugs or minor new technologies, but there is no substitute for building that foundation the hard way.**What should you do?** Keep using AI to get your intern work done, you’re already in and you’re doing your job. On the side, start really learning how to program. Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Start with foundations, then do the JS course. No use of AI allowed, at all. When you get stuck, you have to research on good ol’ google. After you complete even just the first project all on your own, you’ll feel so much more knowledgeable. Don’t drop the ball, make a weekly schedule and complete the entire course. Edit: As you learn more via your individual learning and projects, start incorporating this knowledge into your intern work. Start writing your own code as much as possible, lean less and less on the AI.Once you’ve done that, you’ll probably have enough understanding to know what you need /want to work on next, be it PHP or something else. To touch on your comment about REST APIs, this isn’t a language, more just a concept that you can get a general understanding of in just a couple days or weeks. The more you work with them the more you’ll understand. Again, do real research on this, take notes, and then experiment with making API calls in a personal project",

There is a very strong chance that the exact role has not been open for eight months and that the company has simply been hiring engineers with a similar profile for an extended period of time. In recruiting this is often referred to as a \"pipeline\" posting or approach. I've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \\----**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:** Regarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. **Interview Process:** Having an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. **Recommended Approach:**Rather than trying to frame things as \"this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me\" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",

I went from 3/5 performance ratings down to 2/5 and then 1/5. I’ll admit shortly after bereavement I was still grieving so my performance wasn’t perfect. But even after improving and putting in more hours management would only grill me further. I knew it was a matter of time before a PIP. I had already started looking for a job. In between review cycles my manager pinged me 3 min before a 1:1 that someone would be joining the call. I knew it would be HR. They gave me the most generic of PIP’s in the world. I asked for specific benchmarks so I knew I was making progress and they refused. In the beginning I did put some effort into it because the job market was terrible but whenever I hit all the things listed on the PIP they would say there are other areas I wasn’t hitting and that even if I hit everything on the PIP I still need to hit all job requirements. Essentially I would get fired no matter what. Okay whatever. Halfway (PIP was 5 weeks) they said I wasn’t meeting expectations of the PIP. I stopped trying and instead focused on interviewing elsewhere. By the end of the PIP I still haven’t found a job but was in later stages of interviews with a few places. I got offered a severence package of 2 months salary and took it to “gracefully” leave the company. I also filed for unemployment. Found a job 2 weeks into unemployment and now make more money, have a higher job title, and aren’t treated like shit. And in addition to severence I got a decent unemployment check since the start date of my new job was delayed.",

Managers will use this sometimes to give a struggling employee a second chance.

They would get strong feedback and then do a little better for a little while. They were flagged by hr as a candidate for pip and I couldn't really disagree with that so we put together a pretty fair pip and the employee took the offered severance instead. The other one was all stack ranking driven at a different company. At that time the bottom X% were put on pip or straight fired. My group had a guy we liked but his impact had clearly been less than others at his level. He went on pip, succeeded and eventually became a respected EM at the company. I've never worked a place where someone would use a pip to get rid of someone they \"didnt like\". Im not saying those places dont exist but I've never worked at one.",

Your team lead probably just wants you to build confidence before throwing you into the deep end, not because you suck.The competition anxiety is real tho. When I was building startups, I'd see people constantly worried about being replaced by someone cheaper/smarter/faster. But something Ive learned is that average devs who can communicate well and understand business problems are actually gold.About the PM pivot tho, honestly, it could work. You already have dev background which most PMs lack. You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.But before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely. At Metana, we see tons of people who started as \"average\" developers but found their niche by combining technical skills with other strengthsAlso don't let imposter syndrome make you quit something you might actually be decent at. Maybe you're not the next senior engineer, but you could be a damn good technical PM who actually gets how software works.Give yourself more time to figure out what clicks for you before making the full pivot :)",

Fully remote for mid and senior level is great because you don’t need as much hand holding as you will early on. Take the more established, higher paying startup as the first job. Also, moving away from friends and family is hard but the great thing about your hometown is that it will always be there. Go have a new experience in a cool city, learn and if you hate it, look for a remote job in 2 years and move back. as you get older, it gets much much harder to move away so doing it while you’re young and unattached from major responsibility is the perfect time.",

Be kinder to yourself. Also at your experience level you will start to notice a lot of ageism where companies prefer fresh graduates than you, and those fresh graduates prefer working with other fresh graduates than you, even though it makes no sense on any level given your skills and experience. Often it is actually down to the age of the person managing you and whether they feel intimidated by you or not.Offshoring is the main threat though, plus the amount of competition with all the overqualified laid off people looking for work.FYI: I am in the process of transitioning to Cyber Security - hoping to land security reseacher/appsec/security engineer roles after 20 years in SDE/SDET/Devops roles.",

Chase your passions in your hobbies or side projects, be flexible with your career and find roles or teams that you can be happy in. I do enjoy my work and I really like my coworkers. But if I didn't have to work for money, I'd just focus on music and band stuff. If somehow my band takes off, I'll consider changing careers again. AI and offshoring won't replace everyone. You just have to market yourself and be better than the competition.",

Part of being a SME is demonstrating to employers that you are capable of mastering something. Amazon, for example (at least when I was still there four years ago) only hired developers who were able to show subject matter expertise in anything, the rationale being that if you have mastered something, you can be expected to master something else that they wanted you to be an expert in so you were a safer bet than somebody who hasn't (because its an open question if they even can).",

Many of the layoffs we've seen over the last years are better explained as a correction for pandemic-era overhiring and as adjustment to turbulent markets – but saying you're doubling down on AI productivity sounds better for investors. I see strong parallels to ideas like offshoring.Whatever happens, human problem solving skills will remain valuable. Human software engineering skills will remain valuable, though the bar of what is hireable might become higher (and note that these skills cannot be acquired via vibe-coding). If AI coding agents turn out to be useful in the long-term, then security, QA, code review, and refactoring skills will become increasingly important.",

The fact that they already have customers lined up with 300-500k contracts is actually a really good sign.Your current situation sounds kinda stagnant tbh. Limited learning, backto back layoffs, product that isn't viable... even with job security till Q1/Q2 2026, that's not exactly inspiring. Plus being siloed into just applied AI work when you could be learning MLOps and data engineering, that's valuable stuff.The founding ML engineer role sounds legit too. CEO with previous founder experience, both him and CTO are seasoned with relevant background. That matters way more than people think.Also can you negotiate the equity up to 1% ? At pre seed that's not unreasonable for a founding engineerHonestly the fact that you're even considering it tells me you're probably already leaning towards the startup. Your gut is usually right about these things.One thing tho. Make sure you understand the vesting schedule and what happens to your equity if they don't raise that seed round. But overall this sounds like a solid bet if the team checks out :)",

Honestly, I have no preference. I'm just looking to get any big name on my resume to open doors and compensate for my no-name college. A big AI lab makes sense for my experience, but they're so competitive right now. I at least got an OA from Amazon (didn't advance, will retry in 6 months).>Learning wise do you want to go deeper into applied AI work or MLops work. It seems like to me “being siloed in applied AI work” should be a plus if you are more interested in that part. I wouldn’t think of it as being siloed but given opportunity to develop deeper expertise in that.You're right that being siloed isn't necessarily bad. I frame it negatively because the current work isn't particularly deep - I'm not learning much. The challenging applied AI work is supposedly a few months away, but I worry there'll be another layoff before we get there.>Also are you excited about this new role?I'm not particularly excited about this role, but I'm also not a particularly excitable person :grinning_face_with_sweat:On interviewing longer, wouldn't that mean turning down this offer?
