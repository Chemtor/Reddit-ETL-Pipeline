If any vendor is serious about helping, they need to stop obsessing over workflows and buzzwords, and solve for things that actually are fragile and never talked about. The hard stuff isn't writing ETL, it is visibility into how data changes across systems, understanding why it broke, making reruns sfae, and keeping people aligned on what \"good data\" even means. Basically, the fundamentals that make a system trustworthy.Until vendors take that seriously, every new \"modern\" platform is just another flavor of the same problem.

It depends on whether those advantages are relevant to your business. There are always pain points. What impact, if any, do these have on your business and do they negate the advantages.I worked for a consultancy that was a Snowflake partner. We worked out how to run Snowflake, and other SaaS tech at very low cost. As a Snowflake partner, this made us as popular with them as hemorrhoids in a spacehopper race.What people forget in Tech X vs Tech Y arguments, particularly in the SaaS world, is that both are watching each other, evolving, copying/stealing features. Yesterday, Tech X was ahead, today Tech Y is ahead, tomorrow, who knows?Remember too, it isn't the size of the wand, its the magic of the magician. Lets suppose you can query infinite data infinitely fast. Management take one look at the results, don't like them and send your team off on weeks worth of wild goose chases to determine why the figures don't match their perceptions if what ought to be. Even if you prove the figures are accurate they are likely to insist they are wrong because the data on which the results are based didn't include other factors.",

Now, MS already had a HUGE headstart but they dropped the ball because to achieve optimization on Azure data Warehouse, you had to figure out data distribution, workload management, resource groups etc. With Snowflake everything just worked without hassle. We are hearing more and more about SF because at some point in their journey, SF realized they don't just want to provide cloud data warehouse services but become an E2E cloud platform of their own. And now we see their offerings such as Snowflake notebooks (ML workloads), Cortex Analyst (AI), Snowflake Intelligence, Document Intelligence and more. If your processed data already resides on their platform, it's understandable you get dazzled by these new offerings because it is easy to use all of them and even faster to get a POC out in front of the executives. Word gets spread and so does its popularity.About vendors lock-in, in my experience that will happen with companies with proprietary technologies.",

Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.Data engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. The decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. More recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse. Policy driven access control and dynamic data masking has changed how data governance is enforced. Snowflake and Databricks are continuing to gain market share. LLM's are changing what needs to be delivered to stakeholders.",

Data engineering is seeing the same uncomfortable growing pains that cloud computing (2008-2012) and frontend development (2012-2015) endured, with vendor repackaging existing alongside real innovation. While medallion architecture is undeniably repackaged data warehousing, open table formats like Iceberg are enabling radical change from proprietary silos to interoperable ecosystems (just like containers enabled a new infrastructure), zero-ETL is eliminating traditional pipelines entirely, and LLM observability is an entirely new problem space that did not exist three years ago. The technology hasn't experienced \"the end of creativity\", its most likely on track for the next paradigm shift, just like React emerged from frontend's \"framework fatigue\" phase to truly alter the landscape (for better or worse).",

Under the hood we have configuration that samples x% of the dataset in question - profiles and reports the errors and offers one click fix - and ingest it in a staging layer. Beyond that you could add custom validators as long as they adhere to simple contract and add that in configurations. All it needs is - little cleverness, python / pandas and a quick UI (we used streamlit) We call it Data Validation Framework :D",

Our transformations were in SQL but they were all addititive or merges. Incremental models in dbt, depending on your warehouse, can be tricky to get right. Watch for drift between what the incremental model produces vs what a full refresh produces. I think that and snapshots can be two of the features that might be hard to get right, depending on the complexity of the scenario.",

        "body": "First off, SQL is the easiest of the skills to master. I've often hired data engineers that had little SQL - and just trained them on the team. Within a month they had advanced skills. That's far easier than understanding CI/CD, data modeling, python, java, etc, etc, etc.However, there's other things that take much longer to learn that you could run into: data modeling, the many solutions to data quality, the trade-offs of streaming vs micro-batches vs batches, etc, etc, etc.As an experienced software engineer you're in a position to guide a team of data engineers on what is often their weakest area: software engineering fundamentals. But I'd suggest that it would be valuable to have someone else experienced on the team that you could rely on for some of their data domain expertise.",

Reduces redundancy: Redundancy is when the same information is stored multiple times, and a good way of avoiding this is by splitting data into smaller tables.> 1. Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.> 1. Minimizes **update anomalies**: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.> 1. Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.Anyway, I'll encourage you to skim their section about \"update anomalies\" and focus on the examples.",

First, it's a bank. Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.Second, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.Having to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.That said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place. They really are doing shit no other bank can. There are very good teams doing interesting work and very toxic teams where you will get fucked.Just like life it's a mixed bag. They pay well and if you aren't a coward you can learn a lot from those few awesome engineers holding down the fort. Take the money ride the wave and see where it takes you.",

        "body": "Great question, and yeah, DuckDB is the analytical engine under the hood, but Arc is much more than a wrapper.Arc handles the full time-series ingestion, storage, and query pipeline around DuckDB. That includes:× High-throughput ingestion (1.8M+ records/sec via MessagePack binary protocol) × Schema inference & evolution for time-series data× Automatic Parquet partitioning by measurement/hour × S3-compatible storage management (MinIO or AWS S3) × Query caching and REST API layer built inUnlike most DuckDB-based tools, Arc separates compute from storage, (but we really do that) the database layer can scale independently while storing data economically in S3 or MinIO. That makes it possible to handle massive historical datasets without expensive SSD clusters or rebalancing.From a performance standpoint, we’ve benchmarked Arc using ClickBench, the industry-standard analytical test suite.On identical hardware (AWS c6a.4xlarge), Arc outperforms TimescaleDB and InfluxDB by a wide margin.Without cache: Arc ranks #8 out of 60+ systems.With cache: it climbs to #3 overall, just behind DuckDB and ClickHouse.Benchmarks and details here: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-), here too: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results)In short, DuckDB gives Arc its analytics speed, but Arc extends that into a scalable, long-term time-series warehouse that can economically retain and query billions of records using Parquet and object storage.",

I actually dug a bit into Delta Lake and SeaweedFS after your comment, both are super interesting projects.From what I see, Delta Lake (or delta-rs) is more data-lake oriented, strong on ACID transactions, schema evolution, and batch updates. Arc’s focus is a bit different: it’s built for continuous ingestion and fast time-based queries, where writes are append-only and most performance comes from how data is partitioned and scanned, not from transactional updates.Right now, MinIO is the default because it’s stable, simple, and S3-compatible, which makes it easy to run Arc anywhere (local, on-prem, or cloud).That said, we’re still very early in the journey, and the storage layer isn’t locked in stone, we’ll definitely explore other options if they offer better trade-offs in performance or availability. Thanks for the SeaweedFS suggestion, we’ll plan to run some tests and look into supporting it as a storage backend.",

There was an independent devops team who could’ve helped us with infra but they washed their hands of my team and forced us to use clickops since they controlled the infra repos and AWS credentials. 3) Current job is very tech heavy, great engineering culture.

I have regular flare-ups of imposter syndrome, but have come to realize this usually happens under high negative pressure from unrealistic deadlines, poisonous office politics, or when I’m simply ill or haven’t been sleeping enough. The good days by far offset the bad ones, and I’ll realize that there are plenty of essential skills and experience that I bring to the table that typical CS profiles bring less of: e.g. engineers tend to ‘tunnel’ into technical problem solving and often struggle to zoom out and grasp the broader domain context. I have experience in multiple business process domains and in financial management, which in turn drives (executive) decision making. If you don’t grasp that, you can design fantastic technical solutions, but won’t ever get top down support to fund and execute against them.So, we can all learn from each other and together we create success. In my spare time I dig into my team’s code and do engineering training/certifications to learn more about that space and better lead my teams by asking better questions. I cannot judge whether you’re too far out of your depth in your current role, or whether you’re simply suffering the discomfort that actually indicates that you’re in the ‘learning zone’. That’s up to you to figure out. Just don’t be afraid to fail and don’t walk away out of fear. And take care of your physical and mental health while you’re working on your professional growth. You’ll come out stronger. Good luck!!",

That is an important part of the SDLC and cannot be missed We do not ever PR to prod. That is a very bad design. We PR to dev/sandbox and test it. Once test passes we or team leads PR to QA branch where QA teams test functionality with their battery of tests. It goes on till code reaches release branch and gets deployed to Prod.

I was serving a corporate meeting dinner and spilled a whole gravy boat down some important person's suit jacket.To echo what my old manager said to somebody who kept apologising, nobody wants to hear apologies. Everybody just wants to see improvement.First thing is hold yourself to high standards. Give yourself a rule - you're allowed to make mistakes once. Once you mess up, you make adjustments to fix it. I am quite forgetful and give myself a lot to do although I've found writing down a list of actions for a project, prioritising them, and then going through them one by one was great for my organisation.Second is to also be kind to yourself. Care about what you can control, accept that shit happens for things you can't. If you miss an edge case that you can't predict, then honestly, there's no point beating yourself up about it. I'll give you another story - I was getting a user reporting a migration \"wasn't correct\" even though it was 100% exactly the same as it was before. \"I don't see these characters that are appearing before. They're there now. The migration has failed\", they said. If you look at it with the naked eye, you'd be right. They don't exist...IN THE SQL DATABASE. When converted to parquet they show up. Shit was literally invisible to the naked eye and to the IDE looking at the text in SQL, but if you go and look at the fucking location specific character encoding and convert it, it is 100% there.This comes with experience. Some things cannot be helped. Mistakes will always happen. It's how we handle them after which defines us as people.",

For that I use vs code with VS Vim extension and the MSSQL extension.But any other db specific things like setting up SQL Server agent, configuring security stuff, etc., I stick to SSMS. Key binds are very important once you learn them IMO. I can write code so much faster with vim key binds.",

Garbage in, garbage out still applies, and with AI models relying on massive, reliable datasets, the demand for skilled data engineers, data architects, and analysts is only going to grow.The point about ultra high integrity data is key. Companies will need to rethink their entire data strategy, from ingestion to processing to validation, because legacy systems just will not cut it. The AI wave does not replace humans. It raises the bar for the humans managing data. In fact, those who understand how to design systems that consistently produce high-quality data will be more in demand than ever.It is not just about feeding AI. It is about building a data-first infrastructure that can power analytics, operational applications, and AI-driven products simultaneously.

The tedious stuff like basic ETL scripts and transformations, that's already getting easier. But the hard problems? Understanding messy legacy systems, making architectural decisions, and figuring out data lineage in nightmare scenarios that still need humans who know what they're doing.The bit about companies needing to restart their data operations rings true. I've seen organisations realise their data is basically unusable for anything sophisticated and having to retrofit quality controls they should've had from day one.I reckon junior roles doing routine work might shift, but experienced data engineers who can actually solve complex problems? They'll be fine. Probably busier than ever.What's your experience been? Are you seeing companies actually investing in proper data quality or just hoping AI magically fixes it?",

That gives a huge advantage to SQL in my opinion.(2) Ibis must be crazy difficult to maintain given that it interfaces with so many different engines, that’s gotta be something to consider when writing code that you want to be performant 15 years from now.

Python is my main language, so doing the above work using GAS(Javascript via ChatGPT lol) is quite a new experience to me.Here's your problem. If you want to sell yourself as a consultant, make sure you have the experience to know what you're doing. Then all other questions (how to do it, how to scale, how much will it cost) solve themselves.If you don't have the experience and you want to learn at the cost of the client, make sure to tell them upfront. Otherwise you're building something that won't fit their needs, and that won't be able to adapt to their future needs. Something like this wouldn't sell, even if it's free.I would recommend joining an established data team as an junior employee or consultant for 2 to 5 years, until you've mastered one niche in the field. You might need to pitch as a data analyst instead of a DE, because DE is typically not seen as a junior-level job.",

Practical path: have the client create a GCP project and add you as a temporary role; move the Looker Studio report and data sources to their accounts and re-auth. Land each CSV into a raw BigQuery table, then build a small star schema with scheduled queries; for repeatable transforms, run dbt Core on Cloud Run triggered by Cloud Scheduler. Keep costs tiny by using on-demand pricing, turning off BI Engine, setting maximum bytes billed in every query/source, and materializing small summary tables for Looker Studio. For speed, use Extract Data in Looker Studio on top of your fact tables. For handoff/sell: include a cost dashboard, a runbook (schemas, schedules, service account permissions), version-controlled SQL in a client-owned repo, and a light maintenance retainer. I’ve paired dbt Core and Airbyte for ETL, with DreamFactory when I needed a quick secure REST API layer for Apps Script or external tools. Bottom line: client-owned GCP, BigQuery with cost guards, and precomputed models over Sheets hacks.",

I personally don't like having them unnested automatically, because sometimes the tables have too many arrays / dicts, and unnesting all of them creates a lot of tables. I like to control the fields, so if there is a need for unnesting, I like to do it myself. If a column will never be used, it doesn't make sense to unnest it at all.Another reason I dislike it is that, in modern DWHs, you can store JSON, as well as arrays/structs. So if you can store an array in a table, why should you unnest it? Keeping them as is gives you more power than splitting them into different tables.",

If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. That being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.If you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it. regarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",

Since dbt is in Python.. didn't quite know why it had to jump over to an adapter to do the Python models, but I went and submitted a issue on the Microsoft adapter github page to see if they could add that. One of my layers was to have some intelligent data cleansing and the Python models helped a ton with that idea. Another idea was to start sending some specific models out to an API, drop a CSV file into a shared folder, or throw some highly processed models at the top, all as part of the morning run. Legit use cases that could be then just sync'd up in dbt. Their response was, \"No. We will never do Python models. We do databases only.\" :enraged_face:",

If you have to work more than your allotted hours in order for your company to notice you, then your company is terrible. Sure, sometimes you have to put in more hours during an emergency and that commands recognition - doing something you don't necessarily have to do.In my opinion, and what I've always been taught, is if you consistently have to work overtime just to complete your regular day to day tasks, you have too much on your plate.>In this migration project I am working solo and carrying out planning, BA, business interaction, dev, BI, QA, and data gov & administration and the scope is only getting bigger.Is there anybody else you can work with here? Or at least communicate there's too much going on who isn't the scrum master?>I am connecting with both tmw but I wanna seek your advice on how to best manage these escalating situations and not let it affect my life and health over 0 mental or financial compensation.Clear communication is required here. Saying you have too much on is completely alright (provided you have too much on) and then you have to present them alternatives e.g. there is too much work and all of it can't be completed at the same time without more resource. If I get more resource, then fine. If I don't get more resource, what do you want to be prioritised and who do we need to let know that this isn't going to be on time.",

For BigQuery, we had to push lineage via API/dbt metadata; otherwise you get spotty, table‑level links. Watch cost: cap the Data Map size, scan only curated zones, and schedule weekly not daily. A workable pattern was keeping GCP Dataplex/BigQuery lineage for engineers while using Purview for glossary, classifications, and compliance reporting. If open source is off the table, Atlan or Alation tend to give a smoother cross‑cloud UX and integrate cleanly with dbt/OpenLineage.I’ve used Atlan and Alation for catalog/search, and paired DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST APIs from Snowflake/BigQuery so downstream apps could hit governed datasets without custom gateways.Bottom line: unless you’re leaning into Azure, Purview won’t match Collibra’s cross‑cloud polish-prove value with a narrow pilot and keep GCP‑native lineage in play.",

Edit: I see that you say the MI has Admin permission in the Fabric workspace, so you should be covered there already. If the notebook and warehouse are in different workspaces, the MI will probably need at least Contributor in both workspaces. It doesn't need to have any permissions on the capacity.Perhaps the .synapsesql() just doesn't work when triggered by MI. This seems to be a related case: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Warehouse/Service-Principal-Getting-quot-HTTP-request-forbidden-quot-When/m-p/4832636As a workaround, you can write to a Lakehouse table (and, if you insist on using a Warehouse, you can use API to do a metadata sync of the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint and then load the data from the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint into the Warehouse using a T-SQL script/stored procedure).Re: Storage blob contributor. No, it should not be relevant here. Storage blob roles are Azure roles. In Fabric, the Workspace Contributor (or Member/Admin) is what matters.",

But they agree on Parquet, Deletion vectors, and I believe they've just aligned on geospatial data types too. So they're very similar and as a result, can be made interoperable. Should you prefer Iceberg or Delta Lake as your \"preferred\" catalog or open table format? Jury still seems to be out. But if you end up wanting to change your preferred format, or end up needing to speak multiple to interface with tools that only handle one, that's very doable these days thanks to tools like Apache XTable.See https://xtable.apache.org/. It can translate between Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi metadata, without needing to duplicate the data itself. Disclosure: my employer contributes to Apache XTable (and offers table format virtualization et cetera as part of Microsoft OneLake: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-iceberg-tables)Not trying to sell you anything here though - Apache XTable is OSS and thus free to run on-premise of course (except for the hardware itself and your time, of course). If you have e.g. S3 api compatible blob storage on premise, believe it's supported: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/how-toAlso has nice docs on integrating with various other catalogs: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/catalogs-index",

        "body": "The best practice is to keep your pipelines simple, manageable and predictable. Which is harder than you can imagine, especially when you are doing complex things. One of the root causes of pipeline complexity is that many platforms (astronomer, dagster etc) force you to handle failure/boundary conditions, dependency management, etc., even when the logic is clean. In other words, a majority of this complexity is just the result of compensating for platform gaps, which ends up destroying maintainability and predictability.My $0.02 - go with a platform that provides a declarative (as opposed to imperative) approach, where you focus on the data flow/transformation, and the platform handles the failures in a predictable manner. * If you are already on databricks, delta live tables are it. * If you are exploring alternatives and want something lighter weight, tabsdata is a good alternative that you can run on your laptop and expand on later. Both these systems will allow you to use your favorite python tools without having to worry about orchestration overhead and failures etc.",

It also saves time. * You can expand the list of sources that you cover. You can take a look at ready-made platforms or open-source tools to ingest data from all these different sources you need. * At this stage, the data would land in a place you control in a certain layout and structure at least.* In terms of formats, the answer would depend very heavily on the types of formats: * If you have machine-readable formats like JSON, CSV, Excel files, Parquet files, and whatnot, this just becomes an orchestration problem, throw a data pipeline tool on it and you are golden. * I presume that's not the only thing, since you give the PDF example. Parsing PDFs with varying schemas over time is a hell I don't wish my worst enemies to go through, so that's not easy. * I have recently played around with Mistral's OCR model to extract a bunch of invoice data and it worked flawlessly, tackled \\~95% of our incoming invoices. * This would still require you to build a data pipeline solution around this, where the underlying work would be done by an AI model that would extract the structured data. * Once you have the structured data out, you would store this data in a data warehouse or a data lake with a clear schema and structure.From this point onwards, you would have a:* Central lake where you store the raw files* A data warehouse / data lake where you store the extracted and structured dataThis would theoretically get you to a better place. Obviously, what I wrote above contains a huge list of assumptions, but hopefully it helps with the general idea.",

I’ve faced something similar; every client exporting reports a bit differently, so one script fix breaks ten others.What helped me was building small modular extractors instead of one big script, so I could swap logic depending on the client’s format. I also started logging structure patterns and using them as templates to detect format changes early. It’s still not perfect, but it reduced the constant rewriting.Out of curiosity, are your PDFs more like structured tables or messy text-based reports?

For each source object, canonicalize JSON (sorted keys) or extract PDF text, then compute a doc hash and per-chunk hash; skip unchanged docs and only re-embed chunks whose hash changed. Track docid, sourceurl, lastseenetag, dochash, embedmodel, embedversion, chunkid, chunkhash, qdrantid, status, and pagination watermarks. DynamoDB works well (GSIs on status/source + TTL for old versions), though Postgres is fine if you want richer queries. In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes. Airbyte and AWS Glue handled odd API pulls for us; DreamFactory helped when we had to auto-generate REST APIs from legacy DBs to keep ingestion consistent. Add the metadata DB early and rely on hashing/versioning so updates don’t blow up your pipeline.",

That lets you revoke, reapply, and report on overrides without touching the base record. If you keep it inline, make origvalue immutable, add updatedat/updatedby/reason, and guard the update path so file uploads can’t rewrite origvalue.Performance-wise, COALESCE on a nullable override column is cheap; just index the business key. Keep raw in bronze, compute final in silver, and document the rule. Fivetran and dbt handled this cleanly for me, and DreamFactory exposed a small CRUD API so ops could edit the override table safely.So yes, your approach works, just enforce immutability and plan for audits or use an overrides table.",

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.The shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.If you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",

That's like potentially an hour each way or more if traffic is bad compared with like 20 minutes now, max? That longer commute would really be a negative for me. I absolutely hate commuting and losing time sitting in traffic.On the other hand, the new role sounds better, and I don't think you can count on internal promotion, like you said. Power BI should be a good pathway into some relevant skills like SQL querying. And there should be internal opportunities at the new gig, too. That isn't any real unique situation to have that option.I won't say either way though - the new job sounds better to me, but I would hate to be commuting so much. Maybe the hybrid makes up for it?

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code. Use SourceAsset for cross-repo dependencies and auto-materialize policies to keep downstream models up to date.Partition raw by ingestion date (daily/hourly), then map partitions downstream; avoid per-table custom partitions unless there’s a real reason. Cap fan-out with multi-asset nodes for shared transforms. Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy. Testing: unit-test asset functions with buildassetcontext, add asset checks for row counts/nulls, and layer Great Expectations or pandera where needed.I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms; in a few cases DreamFactory auto-generated REST APIs on top of legacy DBs so Dagster could pull from them without custom services.Short version: keep core assets static, generate raw assets from metadata.",

As a professional who's working in this field, I'd like to kindly pick your thoughts on what entry-level roles I might target to land my first job in DE and what advice you might offer moving forward in terms of career path.I used to say \"just go for mid level\" because there is a lot more opportunity there than the junior market although over time, I think a bit of revision is required:* If you already work in a data focussed job or a job which involves interpreting a lot of data (typical STEM kinds of roles) or already have a programming job and enjoy it, then continue building your portfolio and go for a mid level role. Objectively, if you are somebody who works in engineering or science and spend a lot of your time crunching numbers and interpreting spectra/graphs/lines on paper correlating to values, then mid level is absolutely for you because you already have one part of being a DE drilled in - interrogating generated data* If you do not have any experience of working in a data focussed job (perhaps you're a service worker or manual labourer with a big interest in programming, automation, and data), then start as a data analyst, get used to working with data, and build from thereSo, in your case, it'll be option 2 by the sounds of it.",

That way you end up with more clarity on which column goes to what. And optionally, you can prefix each column name with the role play if that works best for your reporting tool. For example: * dim_date_invoice_paid.date_key * dim_date_invoice_approved.date_keyor * dim_date_invoice_approved.invoice_paid_date_key * dim_date_invoice_approved.invoice_approved_date_key",

This lets you apply slicers/filters by different date contexts simultaneously.This second option is generally more complex for users to understand and navigate, so I would not recommend unless there is a very specific use case, as it typically requires more end user support & education.",

You are hired to deliver business value using data, do that. This will give you both credibility internally, as well as future buy-in for deeper technical decisions you'll make.In the mid-term, I think your intuition is correct: you'll want to move the data into an analytical database and do the processing there. This would allow you to ensure the data is in the right shape, is accurate, and is easy and cheap to query from Power BI. You'll probably need to be pragmatic there too, therefore a first step in that direction could be something that you can run locally. That would mean no risky business in terms of access control, would be a bit of manual work for you but wouldn't require additional buy-in from different teams. The middle database could also be a SQL Server instance if the company is a Microsoft shop, it doesn't have to be Databricks if it is not available just yet.In the longer term, you'll probably want to move towards whatever the rest of the organization is doing. In case they have ETL solutions, you'd probably integrate these new sources with those and make this data available within the boundaries of the organization.Long story short: it sounds like you are working in a political environment, if I were you I would try to balance the best practices with immediate value being delivered in order to gain further trust and also give your superiors more evidence that you are on top of this.",

It's not like the knowledge of how to build an OS, or a compiler, or a web browser is some mysterious lost art. People can and do still perform the same kind of \"deep work\" today.In fact, older software was quite primitive in a lot of ways. When we look back on things like early Unix, or DOOM, or HyperCard, it's easy to notice all the advancements that were made compared to the state of the art at the time. But there were also lots of limitations and missing features, because either the hardware wasn't powerful enough, or people just hadn't thought of them yet.And it's not like every developer back in the 80s and 90s was some hot-shot genius.

It was common for mainframes to be used to emulate several early microcomputer for software development to test programs that were meant to be cross-compiled before Windows became dominant. And old programs made for older mainframes would sometimes be supported via emulation to allow businesses to upgrade their equipment as technology improved.This all comes down to one of the most important skills in programming: the ability to take one big problem, and break it down into smaller sub-problems that are easier to answer. When you go deep enough into a computer, you will see that the whole thing is basically the idea of a lightswitch, on or off, just repeated billions and trillions of times.",

The first few versions were extremely barebones, limited, barely functional and with countless iterations, some of which were near full rewrites, it became what it is today - you can check its github.The first version of Microsoft Word was basically just what good old Notepad is today - running under MS-DOS - it could barely do more than Notepad apart from pages and some very limited formatting (which was mostly sufficient back when it came out).

Kubernetes goes further on this idea but wants to play nicely with microservices. It’s all incremental developments.

        "body": "A system call is basically just a fancy kind of function call. The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.The kernel can \"receive\" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the \"list of running processes\" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to \"print\" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly. User code is normally forbidden from doing this by the CPU's memory protection hardware.",

Daylight savings time rules vary from place to place.

Much of the Middle East used to have Thursday/Friday as the weekend. Friday is the day of prayer. But a lot of countries in the region switched to Friday/Saturday so that they would share more working days with the rest of the world. Oh. Brunei is an exception.

Sometimes the available precision is variable.Timezone information has variable context and relevance. Some calendar entries should move when the country you're in changed to summer time; others shouldn't; still others should move when a _different_ country changes to summer time. For any representation, sometimes we want to handle an abstracted representation (eg as an integer), but at others we need to make sure we get a specific element of the localised representation right in a customised way.Basically, date and time are incredibly complicated.Bonus: timezone weirdness means that (in a certain technical sense) a day can be 26 hours long.",

The measurement unit and restriction physicists and astronomers need and grapple with isn't really identical to the social construct involved in your alarm clock. The laws of physics, the laws of a country and the laws of an economic zone aren't even laws in the same sense.E.g. one difference between unix time and UTC is [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). There are a few different strategies to dealing with this on computers, like making the seconds slightly longer throughout the day, or adding a 61st second to a relevant minute, which may be enumerated as either `59, 60, 00` or `59, 59, 00`. All of the options fuck with software that has no clue what a leap second is.Another example: [Sidereal years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year) aren't the same thing as the thing you're used to thinking of as a year (here's a nice [veritasium video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)).And those are just physics problems. In addition you've got all the social problems involved in timezones as the other commenters have gone into.\"Time\" is a simple word hiding a lot of horribly complex ideas.

So I think the authors’ goal is not to teach strictly Python, but to teach general programming concepts.At a conceptual level, most programming languages are all the same. They might differ on little stuff like brackets and indentation, or on big stuff like type safety and compilation, but at a high level they all expose the exact same tools to the programmer, like loops, conditionals, functions and collections.So by playing a game where you solve problems with code, you’re still effectively learning to program. Once you understand these concepts - once your brain “thinks in code” - it’s easy to transfer those skills to another language and another syntax, whether it’s Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, C++, whatever. The syntax can be googled, but the concepts stay the same.",

The situation is basically you don't know where to start, what to do, how to get to the next level, etc. Granted, this will be slightly biased as I do full-stack + devops and own a fledgling software company. In other words, I am very product-oriented.Think of a product that you actually want to exist in the real world. It's okay if the thing you want to build happens to be in existence already, just don't make \"clones\" of things that already exist. Like don't go make a Twitter clone because you'll get bored before you can solve the fun problems and there are about a thousand videos showing you every step of solving said problems. Not fun, not unique, not impressive, not engaging in my opinion.That being said, there's nothing wrong with going forward with your own social media idea and forging your own path. I would even encourage you to do so if that's what you are interested in. And you can take inspiration from how existing products handle certain problems. That's a common practice. Copy the high-performers. Aggregate existing solutions from difference sources to create a new output.The real gains are when you see a gap in the real world that technology can fill and then you capitalize on it. No good app to do some random thing that would be really cool if it existed? Build that app. Deploy it. Tell people about it. Maybe they will use it. Improve said app based on feedback. Maybe they will tell their friends. Next thing you know you have learned a world of information and built skills you didn't know existed.That's how I stayed engaged. Not the path for everyone.",

If that's just not an option, I'd look for similar options online, like1. Team treehouse (because they use slack) or get on a paid platform With Team Treehouse, they have 5 tech degree programs (C# is not one of em), and what I like are projects at then end of each set of curriculum. Not sure if that's for you, but it's an example of a platform with resources; people you can turn to.2. live instructors (at o'reilly and elsewhere)3. Discord. There are channels with developers of all skillsets, so if you can get on one of those servers, you can interact with like-minded individuals. I have *not* done live learning at O'Reilly, but I have been on their platform and taken courses. You might want to see if they have assignments, office hours and the like in their live classes.",

Why are there 3 layers of indirection? Wat is this ;-; ?? \". The gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how \"professional\" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \\*work\\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. 1. Read the classics. Reading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns. Stuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \\*right now\\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.2. Rewrite your own old code. Grab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your \"thinking level\" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.3. Try contributing to large OSS projects. Tips: \\- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate. \\- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability. \\- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable. The feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \\*key\\*.**TL;DR:** Real-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug . Read literature to get the theory, revisit (and refactor) your own old code and see your growth, study bit open-source projects. Also, communication matters more than people admit.",

Evaluate your toolchain periodically, using a good IDE, updated compiler versions, linters, static analysis, continuous integration, etc. and treat compiler warnings as hard errors.2. Production code has what will probably look to you like an insane amount of error-handling code and error/debug logging. It's there for a reason. Amateurs like my former self are satisfied letting an app crash with a cryptic message.3. Similarly, an apparently huge quantity of unit test code. Former me was focused on \"getting the code to work\", but if it only works for the happy-path cases, that's not nearly good enough.4. Once it's working and tested, resist the urge to go changing things willy-nilly. When you change something, anything at all, you run the risk of introducing errors. Don't change things unless you have a good reason.5. If you observe something about your code that you don't understand, any kind of unexplained behavior... don't stop working until you DO understand it. It's very often an error lurking. Don't ignore it.There's lots more. Again, you learn best by working with professionals and shipping software to real users.",

Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as \"objects\" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is \"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout. Hope you found this comment helpful.",

Those of us who are ESL will very likely speak with an accent but can still be very capable at English, and without mixing languages all the time (if anything the contamination seems to go more the other way when younger people with a smaller vocabulary are overexposed to anglophone memes).Significant semantic differences like that of string mutability should become reflexive over time, though you may also find that your expectations gravitate towards the strictest among the languages you usually use, as you don't get errors for being more conservative than you strictly need to be.There are some things that are more trivial differences that I think you'll just have to live with though, like whether it's `s.trim()` or `s.strip()`, or `len(xs)` vs `xs.len()`. For those you basically just have to have a language server or some other step to catch your goofs. You'll be able to fix it immediately as soon as you get the feedback because you ultimately know the semantics you want and you do know both variants, but made a mistake on the level of a spelling mistake. (And of course it's possible to stumble into spelling mistakes that result in valid grammar with different semantics, just like in human languages.)So I expect that I'll get the case right for `bool`/`Bool` because I can remember that convention for a given language, but I _will_ mix up whether or not it ends with `-ean` because that's not really something I can reason my way into.",

I know some people get ergonomic mice for this, but I opted to change my workflow. I started using Linux with a tiling window manager and multiple monitors, a mouse-free text editor(Emacs, and later Neovim), CLI interfaces when possible, and the Vimium C browser plugin for the bulk of my web navigation. The relief was immediate, but the injury lingered for a while, maybe a year. But I haven't had it since, which was maybe 4 years ago.There are a lot of opinions and ideas about good posture, but just remember that these are more like starting points. Your body is going to need a certain posture. It's hard to know what that is until you put a serious effort into trying something out, but if you aren't seeing results after a week or so, make adjustments.",

Airbus, for example, contributes a lot of imagery.Google maps and other secondary imagery sources buy imagery from many different sources, and then combine them altogether. When you ask for a particular tile from a source like Google's Map Tile API, their servers decide which to send to you based on context like where you are and how far you're zoomed in. You can see exactly where all the imagery comes from for a given view at the bottom right of the screen. You'll often see names like NASA, MAXAR, Airbus, and the name of the local Government.I'm terms of the roads and such, I don't actually know where that data originally came from. OpenStreetMaps is a common places to get that data from now, though.",

        "body": "This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.Any geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. Of course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent. Anyways, that’s my quick intro, and each of those areas could be greatly expanded upon.",

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is \"orthophotomap\". They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. Web servers spit out those images as \"tiles\". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless. If you watch your map app you can see it retrieving and displaying tile-by-tile.You can see, especially in more remote areas, the swaths of imagery. Maybe one swath was taken in the spring, and another in the fall. So they look a bit different.The features, I think Google has their own streets-and-borders-and-rivers data. OpenStreetMap.org has a crowdsourced and quite excellent freely available database like that. With nice APIs. Good good stuff. You could make a very interesting student project with it if you wanted to.I once worked at a map-making company that got hired to make a super high rez orthophotomap of O'Hare International Airport near Chicago. Our pilot got an earful from Air Traffic Control when he tried to get them to let him do his job flying back and forth over the field at 600ft above ground level. He had to get the top airport executive and some ATC honcho to go together up to the tower and personally tell the controllers to cooperate. No visible swaths in that job!",

There's no reason for OOP other than to make it easier for humans to work with code.In my opinion, the most useful purpose of OOP is to let you establish rules, so that somebody working with your code can't accidentally use it wrong.That's why it's so popular at large companies. Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.Similarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.Without OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.Sometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself! Even if you're the only one working on a program, OOP provides a way to organize it and help keep you from accidentally using your own code the wrong way.",

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of \"objects\"; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like \"hungry\", \"happy\" or \"dead\". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; \"encapsulation\" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), \"inheritance\" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and \"polymorphism\" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",

An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.",

JavaScript is the only language with built-in templating, rendering, and styling (HTML, the browser, and CSS).PHP is server-first, and how most of us interacted with the web long before JavaScript’s breakout - before Google’s V8 engine, and that standardization of JS and the browser APIs. Since then, the web has evolved around JavaScript, whereas PHP would be long-forgotten if it wasn't for Laravel.Additionally, even if you learn JS, you'll have no problem using PHP. I'm a TypeScript and Go developer, and I have at least 2 Laravel apps in my portfolio. Writing and updating PHP isn't a problem. I don't know it all by heart, but it's a pretty simple adjustment.",

The CPU saves its current instruction location (as memory address somewhere in a CPU register), and this increases after each executed instruction.The compiler initially arranges that each function is a separate block of consecutive instructions.To \"call\" a function, there's be basically instruction that says \"now jump elsewhere, to this specific address\" in the \"parent\" function. The target address is the start of the function that should be called.And still before that, the parent function saves it's current instruction position somewhere on the stack (in a specific defined location, not just anywhere). This is necessary to that when the called function ends, it can jump back to the position the parent function stopped. For this reason, most usual functions have such a jump at the end added by the compiler.",

Sign up for courses that both teach you something fundamental and make you implement things. Operating systems is a perfect example. You will learn a lot about how computers work from a low level and it will include writing and reading code. Other examples could be networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, or computer graphics. Basically any class where your homework is largely writing code. Many classes could fall into this category or not depending on how they're taught. For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.This is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.If you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project. If you are stuck, go to office hours and ask for help. Take advantage of the resources and expertise available to you. Professors have connections in industry, if you stand out they can help you or they might even employ you directly",

For example, you save the order to the order database but you have an error when writing to the delivery database. The error handling in this kind of setup is pretty ugly.If you use a single database, you start a transaction, insert into all different tables, and at the end, you commit the transaction to the database. This ensures that either all or none of the table updates get processed.This is part of the [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) properties that you want to have from a database management system. With a distributed system, achieving ACID is very difficult.",

Look at what data is going to be called independent of other data. Look at what data is going to be relied upon by other calls. Ensure I have separate tables for things that make sense as such. For instance, customer information, doesn't care what restaurants exist, what drivers exist, what drivers are available, etc. So clearly Cx_Info is its own table. Driver information is useful to the customer front end, the restaurant portal potentially, HR/Finance, etc. So again, this should probably be its own table, and accessed largely via JOINs. The restaurant list doesn't care about customers, or drivers. Continue down the line. You'll end up with a bunch of tables, a bunch of JOINs that are needed to process orders, updated the client front-end, etc. but all will be logical. The one I'm stuck out on most right now, is if I'm using a classical SQL database, as opposed to some JSON based noSQL database structure. How do I want to handle individual restaurants menus?",

In this case, it's nice to be able to pull in just the external data definitions, and not the rest of the class.It's been a while, so I can't remember off the top of my head how this shows up when you hit a circular include, but keep it in mind as you start to add more features.",

They were just terminated from the contract, so they didn't owe anything but they didn't get a job either. I guess it was just a waste of time for them. I don't know if anything like that exists now.

        "body": "I think it's important to distinguish between a project being open-source and a project being commercial. They're not mutually exclusive.There are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.There are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the \"top\" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They \"lose\" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you. So if you just want to share and not create a business, then this is fine.",

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",

I optimized images using X, used caching strategy Y, and cut page load times by Z%.”That kind of story shows you can troubleshoot and understand the project, not just that you know the syntax.When I started, I looked at freelancing forums for requests and tried to build the kinds of things people were paying for. That gave me real-world experience quickly because most work involed fixing and extending a legacy codebase. I didn't write, and having to understand “problematic\" code bases.So don’t worry about building something unique right away.

For example, with the **AddressAPI** project, it’s interesting to show how it helps reduce execution time, optimize processes, or solve specific issues.Speaking of development, a good README is one that clearly explains the system design, API design, how the project works, its purpose, and also how to run it properly, right?",

These people will also not only just know the languages/tech that you mentioned, but they would also know computer science fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, OOP, etc. Obviously, most new grads are not experts in these things, but I’m just giving an idea of what you’d probably be up against. Related to that, you would have to learn leetcode, which is most of the time, not extremely relevant to the job/position, but usually required to pass an interview.Yes you can learn all of those things yourself, but to add onto the issue of no degree, a lot of ATS résumé scanners used to look for candidates will immediately filter out people without degrees.So, most people will suggest that you get a degree if you are serious about getting a developer or adjacent position. Not only would you learn important computer science concepts, but it is a good chance for networking and will help you to land a job.Obviously, this is not guaranteed advice, as now, even new grads with internship experience are struggling to find jobs. Yes, you can get a job while self learning, but it is extremely difficult.

        "body": "The first thing to learn, especially for someone with ADHD, isn't actually a programming thing, but rather an organisational problem-solving thing; it's \"divide and conquer\": you need to learn how to split big tasks into small enough sub tasks that they're trivial. You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.Focusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.This is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.The second thing to learn is \"make skeletons\" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.For your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.At any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (\"Agile\" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).There are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",

I like the struggle (masochist >,>)\" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.Second piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think \"Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break\" I write that down in this list. 2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like \"Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week\".3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.By keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. Also, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project. For that reason, I try to keep a list #1 and #2 for each project I have, and I store them in the project itself, so they're always nearby.Hope that's useful!",

Find a beginner friendly book or course about basic consepts of programming and go through it. Know what? If you are aiming to master C++, your initial learning doesn’t even need to be in C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!Mister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.One good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time. This is a simple, little book, that kind of escalates sneakily. You can read it over and over again till you get everything.",

Sure you could read books and do your own projects but will you? Most people will not go nearly as in depth because we tend to be lazy and disorganized. Our bootcamp enforced attendance and had weekly challenges which were difficult enough to require several hours of time outside the class activities.Second our challenges and course material was carefully selected to reflect current industry demands. If you are watching YouTube videos you will likely get sucked into a small niche of data analytics rather than learning the general concepts. This paired with instructional staff who gave feedback, showed issues and helped refine your knowledge, lead to a good base.But aside from this the students who did well and actually got positions, which were more than I expected, were ones who continued polishing and building a portfolio. We got them running but the finish line often requires continued education. But you do build momentum and result in several potential portfolio projects so it is better.TLDR: Bootcamps provide structure and accountability that self learning rarely provides unless you are very organized and driven - but students often still needed to continue working on and polishing their portfolio to get their foot in the door.",

The questions he asked were almost always the first answers from a Google search, so him asking me those questions instead of trying Google first kind of wasted both of our time. If we were working together in person though I would have been more ok with it.Otherwise, my advice would be to try and read through the code to figure out solutions to tasks, but time box it. Spend some effort and you'll build some skills, but if you're at the point of feeling stuck, don't spend hours staying stuck when a team member can help you get unstuck.",

        "body": "It depends on where in the world you are, because the job markets and expected qualifications differ greatly. A country suffices. From a central EU and USA perspective: A degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. A computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to \"self learn\" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. A software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. In some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. Then you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) Certificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done. If you want to know where to start for self learning, there is a quite well written FAQ section in this subreddit (right hand side of your screen on PC, you will find it on mobile as well) with a list of places to start, very well laid out and explained",

I think it would benefit you more to simply practice building web apps. Start by identifying what you're struggling with in particular, and then research and practice it deliberately.Also, if you're finding it hard to study and think you would study easier (or more) if you made a game, think again. The average game is no less difficult to make than the average web app. In fact, games are much more complicated on average, I would say, and the experience of developing a game is nothing like playing one.",

This way you can learn how build systems work under the hood and get into makefiles and also expose yourself to valgrind (this is essential if you want to learn and do your due diligence in the craft.)Also, it would be helpful to learn some C if you haven't already. I recommend c99 for simplicity unless you want to see what threading is all about, then go with c11 or newer. Furthermore, have a very in-depth understanding of how compiled languages differ from interpreted languages (static vs. dynamic languages, respectively)I could go at length, and for some context, I typically point to prerequisites before the actual topic one wants to study. The foundations are too important to ignore, imo",

This means that zero through nine were required to be placed in the code contiguously with the zero at a code point multiple of 16. That is one of code point 0, 16, 32, 48, and so on; they chose to situate zero at 0x30 (48) partly to make sure that special characters appeared before numbers and alphabetical characters in sorted order.Hope this helps.",

The 'A' at 41 and 'a' at 61 allow for upper and lower case conversion and testing to be simple bit operations. There's a few more hidden gems in there.It all comes down to bits.

        "body": ">However, isn't most data in computers stored as binary anyway?Not most. All. Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.And the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really. You could argue that the conversion is still slightly simpler, but it isn't really significantly so, and it's hardly worth losing the benefits such as simpler and more performant sorting for characters.",

Others run on the client side using JavaScript, by dynamically assembling the page using DOM elements.As a very simple example, if all of the pieces you want to use are static content, you can use a web server that supports [Server Side Includes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes). This technology isn't used much nowadays, but it's relatively easy to understand.If you're writing a custom webapp backend, then you can use any server-side templating engine that you want. A template engine can allow one HTML fragment to include others, and it can also allow more dynamic substitutions. Many beginners use Python along with the lightweight Flask web framework, which uses the Jinja template engine.If you're dedicated to using Java, you can use servlets and JSP pages (kind of old school) or you can go with a more modern framework like Spring, which supports a variety of template engines.If you want to use client-side rendering with JavaScript, you once again have lots of options: React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, ...",

He has already booked that time and will get paid for that 30-60 minutes of interview. So, use that time wisely. Ask questions you can learn from.Ask him what is expected from a junior software developer. Ask what are the common obstacles Junior software developers, interns and such as facing. Ask the interviewer to give you a constructive feedback you can learn from.Perhaps ask a list of tools and technologies you should learn to use on a beginner level for you to be able to apply to that company.You can also ask for different reasons why an intern will not make the internship or why a Junior software developer won't make the probation period (of 4 months or so).And, you can ask what will be the requirements for getting an internship or getting accepted into a Junior software developer position in said company.Now, let's step into fairy tales and fantasies. Let's imagine you are a genius. Such people exist. You better have a portfolio with a project that is being used in a real life. Either by you, by your friends, by your relatives or by some strangers. If you manage to pull it out and you can talk ALL about it, then you will have a chance. No other options, really.Either you have working prototypes of some project and you or somebody is using it, or you have like 1-2 years done in your curriculum. And no, calculator apps will not be sufficient.Can you build an actual solution to an actual real life problem and present it in your portfolio and during the interview? It should be a realistic problem not \"But people might be using my calculator app.\" No \"perhaps\"-s and not \"maybe\"-s.If you have such project then your chances to be accepted into an internship will be much higher. Companies are hiring people who actually can solve real life problems.And you should be ready to answer to some random questions about random real life scenarios. For example \"What should you consider when you are building an app for booking tickets to a cinema and that app will be used by 1000s of customers?\" Random theoretic questions.",

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.Stay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",

It's just that they wanted to make a product and there were constraints, so they made the best they could with them. Also, these examples are not proff of anything: > Resident evil used the doors for loading screens but that actually makes the game more tense. More tense *than what*? Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints? I know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations. In any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product. It can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative. The goal of these games is not to be products, even though some of them end up being great base ideas that later get expanded into full games.",

Perhaps if you are *very* used to learning this way, I know fully blind programmers. It’s not just the seeing, it’s the doing. Most people need to actually work with the code to learn what is happening. I’d love to hear otherwise, but syntax simply *is* critical to programming, as can be logic and math, and those are hard to convey except in the abstract without seeing",

I suppose I was thinking you had to memorize everything; couldn't check out books or take your notes home or something. So confused.Anyway, this one time, at band camp. Oh, wait, I wanted to mention tackling. I was playing football this one time, I received the kickoff and I was running at an angle to my left. This dude came flying at me, hit me on the right side and he fell down. I ran it back for a touchdown, when I turned to go back to the sideline, he was there. He asked me how I didn't go down. He was like, dude, I nailed you hard and you didn't budge. It was weird, it was this freak thing, like I was way stronger than him, but he was bigger than me. I figured he didn't know how to tackle, he didn't wrap me, or it was just the wrong angle, like how a spaceship can bounce off the atmosphere on re-entry. That's stuck with me a long time and you mentioning tackling similar issues brought back memories. I'll just say, I think the best thing to do when you're tackling in any situation is to make sure you wrap 'em around the legs. I wouldn't go high.",

        "body": "Oh brother, lets break this down, and I'm going to explain this in a high level, so I don't have any Java-specific tips to give. Maybe just general ones.So in this 2 weeks, you would have to create:- mechanics (movement, AI/automatons, pass/fail conditions, etc.)- look (UI, aesthetics, animations, etc.)- other utils that can be optional (save/load system, settings system, the extra stuff that can help with accessibility)There can be more things here and there depending on complexity, but as a bare minimum, you would make all of these and combine them all together.You're now probably thinking \"oh boi this is a lot of work\" and I don't know how many you are in the team, so my first suggestion is to make it as simple as possible, and only add features if it's possible within the timeframe. Don't try to make too much features that just ends up delaying the release. We call that \"feature creep\". Write a TODO list and gauge the complexity of certain features or aspects so that your team can prioritize on ones that are critical. Don't try to deliver a car without an engine. That's what happened to my team in my game development course in university and we used Unity3D, which has less boilerplate setup than Java Swing (or at least, we don't code the UI from scratch), and we're given a longer time to make the game. Feature creep fucked us over.Next suggestion is learning git and GitHub. Host your project there, and you all can collaborate wherever you are and you can revert changes if stuff did not work right. Creating branches is useful so that everyone's works can be isolated. And you can do peer reviews. This helps with code quality and engages collaboration with each other.Last suggestion: always test. If possible, reserve a few days for playtesting and bugfixing after playtest. That's why we have alpha and beta tests. Alpha test is your whole team testing the game, and beta test is other people playing your game. This will give you a fresh perspective on people interacting with your game. Like as simple as a certain hitbox not working right. Or a critical bug that can happen when conditions are met that your whole team has not encountered in your internal playtesting.And that's it from me. I'm not a professional game developer by any means, and I'm not specialized in Java Swing or Java in general (although it's my main programming language), but my game development course and my current job gave me a lot of insight and workflows on how to tackle potentially large projects like these. And I've realized that the difficulty is not necessarily on the programming, but planning and managing the project altogether. So I guess the first step now is to setup all the things. GitHub, the initial Java project and needed external libraries. Then plan it all out, so that you can assign tasks to yourselves. Feel free to chat in DM. Just don't show weird sht or send a virus that destroys my PC.Oh right before I forget that this post exists, my other advice is to not make AI do your work. Sometimes, they're just doing random sht. Other times, it collides with something. AI relies on your foundation code to become a good asset (which can still screw up, but it may screw up less). So assuming you are allowed to use AI coding agents (because this question will come up at some point), always verify what it types out. Again, this is where peer reviews come into play. Either do it in school or via GitHub PRs.And NEVER EVER USE GENERATIVE AI FOR ANY CREATIVE ASSETS LIKE ART OR MUSIC. We have free assets to use on the Internet if you have to. Making any form of artistic work via Generative AI is a middle finger to artists that have spent hours and hours on making artworks that people appreciate, enjoy, or even connect with.",

Writing out a simple function like 100 times and noting where the params, body, and call were allowed me to have a less vague idea of a function when reading further",

The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.At its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.For example, instead of writing: cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;You can instead write: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { cout << \"Hello World\" << endl; }Classes serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you \"group\" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of \"code safety\" as well.But to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax \"oddities\" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. This is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",

In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. I.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer. But the C Standard (at least all C Standards before C23) only requires platforms to support from -2147483647 to 2147483647 in order to accomodate storing the integer in non 2's complement form. However it seems that C23 requires 2's complement, so maybe that is different in C23. In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. However, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at \"at compile time\" maybe it's really implementation defined). In any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).If you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",

        "body": "> but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place.Correct. You see the contradiction. Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.So I've played with it, and wrote the variations: int x = 5; int x = 5L; int x = 5LL; int x = 5ULL;And I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64. This is what I got: mov w0, 5 //ARM mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5 //x86_64The compiler didn't care what my literal was suffixed. The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.Now as for your code: printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);Yeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.---I think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.C defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types: int8_tEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.The fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.Then there are the `least` types: uint_least32_tEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.Use these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.Continued...",

        "body": "Finally, there are the `fast` types: int_fast16_tEtc. You should use these as function parameters, iterators, and locals. These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.C has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.Most of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.So the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.So this code: printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);It's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.---The other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.Your `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So: typedef struct weight weight; weight *create(int_least32_t); weight *dup(const weight *); weight *copy(weight *, const weight *); void destroy(weight *); weight *add(weight *, const weight *); weight *multiply(weight *, int); int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *); int print(const weight *);Notice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement: struct weight { int_least32_t value; }; weight *create(const int_least32_t value) { weight *w = NULL; if(value >= 0) { weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight)); w.value = value; } return w; } //... weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) { if(res && w) { res.value += w.value; return res; } return NULL; } weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) { if(res && v >= 0) { res.value *= v; return res; } return NULL; }",

        "body": "> consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integerYes, you're right. This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.More on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)Also, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).So in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.If you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case: uint64_t tmp = 1ul; tmp <<= 48; uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp; printf(\"%zu\\n\", sizeof(value)); printf(\"%lu\\n\", value);This should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",

That would be your *Web 2.0* milestone.Only after that I would suggest moving to *Java* and trying to repeat *Web 1.0* and *Web 2.0* milestones. Java and Spring do a lot of things about overall project structure, architecture, testability, etc. And if you jump straight into it you will be overwhelmed.

Alternatively, you can go into subreddits and discords for the language you are using. There are some objective measures you can do. You could benchmark your engine with a known example scene, and see how much memory, FPS, TPS (ticks per second, FPS but for physics), etc. it uses. You can see if it crashes, how good the error messages are, and how well documented it is. How clean your code is, is another subjective measure.

You first need to learn programming, which includes thinking logically, solving problems, and how programming languages work, and then you can switch languages as much as you like. Learning a new language only feels hard to you now, because you don't know how to program yet. Once you know Python, switching to Java will be quite easy for example. And your friend is wrong. Python is plenty effective, and used in real world projects. Mostly in Web-backend, Data Science and automation. Of those three, Java or C# are really only useful as a web backend. I suggest you keep on learning python, until you can comfortably build anything you might want to build. A small webserver, a simple game like Tetris, a system that scrapes the web and alerts you when a point is scored in your favourite sport. Then you can start looking for a job you might want. Not to apply (yet), but to start learning what you need for that job. For example: Frontend web jobs require JS/TS, HTML and CSS, Backend you can do with Python, C#, rust, Java, Kotlin, PHP, ruby, Go, ... basically any language, although some will be more in demand in your area than others. More low level jobs will require C++ or something similar, many PC Programs will be done in C#, just because Microsoft pushes it, and so on. Once you have identified what it is you want to do, you can start working on that. But doing so now, before you understand the fundamentals of programming, will not save you time.",

        "body": "Your friend is wrong. Different languages have different uses. Python is used a lot in data science but also in cyber security and in applied cryptography. If your friend is a web application developer then his experience can be based only on that field. Talk with people from different Computer Sciences fields.I suggest you to try out different things. Because this is what people usually are doing when going for a Bachelor degree in Computer Sciences. When I did my degree studies I learnt telecom, networking (networking protocols and such, not the social networking), embedded programming, building web applications, building mobile apps, building desktop applications, cyber security, etc. And no, I did not specialize in all of these. You will pick one field and specialize in that. Usually one or two.And then after having chosen the thing you like to do then go over different job listings in your target city (forget working remotely, for now) and see which tech stack they are requiring in these jobs. And learn such tech stack. For example, where I live one is picking Java or PHP from backend side when it comes to developing web applications/services and Angular or React when it comes to frontend side. You should decide based on your local job market.",

In my country, in order to get into IT university, you need to have maths exam over 80%, english exam, national language exam +2 exams that are not the same as previous 3. And, even after you have that, there is very few chances that you will be accepted, because right now, 3 most popular courses are IT, Law and Medicine. Every year, thousands of applicants apply just to IT. That’s why I want to give 2-3 years just grinding on my own and then maybe getting a degree or just applying to jobs that would be about what I’m learning. Thanks for the tip about the job. In my country, most used ones are Java, C#, React. That’s why I didn’t know which language to proceed further, because I don’t want to transition between languages at the same time",

        "body": "My first comment is about what you told in the end. Passion CAN feed. Sure, not always but it can. In my case, computer sciences was my passion and my hobby and I eventually went for a degree in it and started working as a software developer. If your passion is art, then yeah, artists are not making much, as I have heard. Do not pick software development just because of its salary. When I did my university studies I saw people picking computer sciences for all the wrong reasons: salary, a friend recommended, a mother wanted, a wish to escape an army service (it is compulsory here), etc. And they dropped out. I saw students burning out, being depressed, etc. because they realized they picked a wrong field. Do you need the same?Pick software development when you have an interest towards it. When you are good problem solver. When you have a mathematical mind. Because software development is all about analyzing different real life problems, coming up with ideas for solutions to these problems, and then implementing and delivering these solutions. If you are not a creative person, if you are unable to figure out solutions to random problems, if you are not interested in sitting behind a computer for 8 hours a day, then this field is not for you.The next step, pick a field that is in demand in place where you plan to start working. And for time being, that place will be Sudan. You are less likely to find a remote job as a beginner or even as a Junior software developer. Which means, you should set your current goal to find a job in your local market. Check job offers in cities around you. From there you can find the technologies and job positions that are in demand. For example you can be interested in blockchains, and it is a valid interest, but when there are exactly ZERO jobs for it, then should you pick it as your main specialty? You can pick it as a side hobby then, but not as something you will be doing for a job.And about machine learning, AI, web development (frontend, backend, full stack), applied cryptography, cyber security, etc. What about trying out these things? The same way how you'd try these out while doing your Bachelor studies in Computer Sciences and having these introduced to you during your courses. When I did my degree studies I learnt some embedded programming, web application development, telecom technologies, system administration, cyber security, different maths, etc. Did I specialize in all of these? No. I specialized in web application development (mainly backend) and in cyber security (did Master studies in it). If you are considering becoming a web application developer then better go for full stack. Which stack? Depends on your local job market. In some places they want PHP developers. Where I live they want Java developers. Pick the technology based on job offers. And the same goes for choosing the front end framework. May it be React, Angular, Vue or something else. Also, then you have to learn some web application security and also some DevOps (enough to deal with Docker, setting up Kafka or some message queuing tool, working with logs, setting up CI/CD pipeline, and perhaps even trying out Kubernetes). Because writing code is not enough. What if your stuff gets hacked? What if the application stops working when 100 people start using it? You have to consider real life scenarios.",

I have found I often had ideas that really enhanced an already planned feature because of being able to synthesize technical knowledge with domain knowledge as opposed to just being handed a checklist from business side.Balancing tradeoffs of delivering value and creating impact with best practices and engineering excellence. This is an entire sliding scale. Internal tools vs product features vs infra etc...But I mean, most enterprise or consumer software is likely just large scale CRUD with maybe a couple more specialized or niche pieces.",

Ridiculous.

I have a mix of Big Tech and startup experience (including an industry recognized staff+ role) and applied to a handful of places and heard back from most. At most places I had a referral. All jobs were \"desirable\" jobs and companies. Sorry for being a bit vague, I keep the personal details vague on reddit.I learned two lessons from the search. First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to \"know the moves\" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on. The market seems to be rough for pure engineering management roles unless your previous team was a strong match for the role.",

Can you imagine casually browsing the relationshipadvice subreddit, and forming your opinion on relationships from that?

I'm a backend developer who ocassionally has to develop using Outsystems, and don't get me wrong it's cool software...but I HATE developing in it, and even more importantly I hate trying to maintain and add additional functionality later on.Everything is hidden by several layers of clicking. There's no information density because it's all dragging and dropping nodes together (which inevitably turns into a literal spiderweb of connections that is annoying to follow).Our company started using it because we wanted to enable some of our customer support folks to do basic development. Great in theory, but every time I start a new project in it instead of writing code, I feel an urge to look for a new job. It works for spinning up a basic CRUD app really fast, but once you do anything complicated you wish you'd just made it with actual code. Software is 10% making the initial codebase, and 90% maintaining it. Nocode platforms make maintaining a nightmare.",

If you think incompetent people are succeeding around you, then you do not understand the competencies that your organization values. You're right. It is petty and not very \"team player\" like to look upon your teammates as undeserving. You have to grasp that you are part of a team, and if you aren't a team player, it doesn't matter what merits you believe you have over another team member. You aren't the one handing out the raises and promotions. The leaders of the team decide what the team values. So, if you don't like what the team values, that's fine. You can go find another team, but recognize that the game is the same. If you want to be valuable to the team, you have to show growth in ways that the team values, not just what you deem valuable. On the other hand, if you can't do that, and feel strongly that you know what is valuable better than anyone else, that's the spirit that drives entrepreneurs. Your path to a good boss might be becoming your own, but you better be able to sell your authority as the guy who knows to clients, and understand what they find valuable.",

Maybe mid-level engineer from what I can tell. You might be able to even upsell as a senior engineer in some places pretty easily depending on your confidence and leadership ambitions. Obviously the work you did won't be a tit-for-tat match with a backend engineer working on some Java WebLogic crap or something but at the end of the day what's more important is that you clearly have the background skills to build complex data pipelines.I'd say focus on selling your FAAS and AWS cloud skillset, those are pretty important in modern infra. >How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field? What's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews?You're probably not really all that rusty. Go do a few LCs and you'll be right back to golden most likely. The important thing to recognize is that if you've done it once, you can do it all again. >Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? I think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. Also, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing. I don't have the personal experience with the BIG data boys though, as my only experience with ETL was with a financial firm myself doing similar work as yours but I can't imagine the practice is somehow deprecated and forgotten to time already. >And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?You can't really build technical depth without working on some larger systems imo. So either build your own or work with what you've got. I built some side projects for fun back in the day that I never really took anywhere but just used to keep my cloud knowledge fresh and available. But realistically you can probably just get by with some refresher courses.",

I relearned some fundamentals using Udemy and started working on my Master's degree. I also picked up courses in System Design using [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com) and educative.io. I use ChatGPT a lot to create study guides for myself when I interview at companies, I try to get a refresher on their tech stack so I can speak their language. I also started doing Leetcode religiously, completed Neetcode's 150 and have about 170 problems on Leetcode.com. It's been a rough journey where I've been passing DSA interviews and System design interviews, but now companies are starting to ask on the job syntax questions to really filter down candidates. There's just too many of us, the market is overly saturated. So now I'm on the grind, building apps from scratch and iterating on it over and over again until I have the syntax down to a T as well. We'll see how my next interviews go. I've had friends in the same boat and I had one friend that studied LC for 6 months straight to get into Meta, but ended up failing the System Design. The other thing is they're super picky about languages now, if you say you know Java, they want you to do their stupid LC in Java. As if knowing syntax is going to make you a good engineer....I've been unemployed for a year and still looking, so you're not alone.People that are employed will never understand what we're going through. In fact, they wouldn't even pass their own interviews today. I can guarantee you that I have more skill than any of them in any system design interview or leetcode question. All they know is how to interview people and of course when you have all the answers in front of you it's easy to do that.Stay strong my brother, I've also considered other roles that are closely related like Customer Support Engineer, DevOps, IT Support, and wait until the economy gets better. I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately. This industries has a lack of respect for senior engineers with the way they treat their engineers. I, too, might have to exit the field as well. I still really enjoy coding and building things, but it may have to do be something I do as a hobby for now instead of professionally.",

What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.But technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.I'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.That being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore. The expectation became that I was the mentor.",

It’s extremely important. You might not code as much but you will be reading tons of it, you will need to understand how systems connect, performance, and tons of other things. Above all you will have to communicate and get buy in, from technical and non technical people. So for both I would say communication is number 1.  I have met staff engineers who were meh technically but they were amazing at getting their ideas into production.

Even if you aren't writing code, you are probably weighing in on design choices, diving deep into high-profile operational issues, or helping teams with disagreements, all of which require understanding technical areas - someone without that understanding usually does not do well. The other thing I've seen in my own career is that while I have gotten more senior, things have mostly shifted from depth to breadth. There was a time where I knew everything about my area: if you had a question about how to build a Java app using Spring storing data in Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB or Mongo, that used Maven as a build script - I probably knew the answer (and still might, at least for whatever old version I used back in the day). Now, the set of things I weigh in spans a very broad set. As a result, in a lot of rooms I do not have the most detailed knowledge of the topic at hand, but I have a ton of context about a whole bunch of other things and how the particular decision fits into 53 other decisions we as a team are trying to make.>it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped.There are two different reasons why this might be. On the one hand, at larger companies the consequences of getting something wrong are much higher, so it is worth it to make sure that component gets shipped the right way. On the other hand, it could be that, yes, you are suffering from bureaucracy. If you've ever had the opportunity to work with a really senior IC though, one of the things they can be great at is figuring out how to remove unnecessary bureaucracy (and navigating needed bureaucracy).",

That is your only leverage, and you will only risk souring the relationship early, which is the worst possible spot to be in. Being unemployed is bad, but having a weird short job on your resume isn’t also pretty bad. Take the job, if you’re unhappy just keep interviewing and don’t say anything about it. If you convert to FTE you might have a bit more leverage.Edit: just to be explicit here: they will not give you a raise, unless you can say you’re between competing offers.",

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.So basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the \"leave now\" option is likely better. Amsterdam is also a good place to start, the next opportunity might be in Berlin, which is also a nice city but much more of a culture shock, and more depressing in winter.",

If you’re clever you can learn the same lessons from switching projects as you can from sticking to one for a long time. It all depends on how many questions you ask about how we got here, and your salesmanship when explaining it to a potential employer.

If you keep discouraging yourself like this then you will end up like one of those adults who only talk about their glory days back in hs. Those people saying better opportunities happen are correct. It can happen and far more frequently. Getting married to an old and obviously shit ideology will never help. Keep your head high and senses alert to find your opportunities. Although anecdotal, I always thought working at Google would be my dream job and the last place I work before retiring. But that went out the window for various factors. Instead I found a new opportunity that is far better in every aspect quite literally and I just stumbled on it by accident. It is one of the harder industries to break into and I found the easy way in by luck. Sometimes luck is all you need to catch a break. And you will be surprised how often luck will show itself. It is up to you to grab it by the throat and be tactful about it Learn and live",

I think in most cases management does not even know what \"quality code\" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job. Now SWE \"talent\" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor. Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",

This will probably get me blasted on this sub, but don't be afraid to take the 40-50k job that no one else wants. You are new to the dev world. Take it and start gaining experience. After a year, start looking for something else, job hop and increase your pay that way. Personally, I started out at a really low paying job. But I worked my butt off. I learned the entire stack (building a server, configuring the network, building code, testing code, creating the CI/CD pipelines, deploying the code, [get blasted for not testing well enough], iterate on the code, redeploy, maintain the code. Then as time progressed, I learned more about micro services, cloud tech, load balancing and ways to handle very very large amounts of data. I got to the point where I knew the entire pipeline of the entire setup, I was then able to communicate with customers about what was possible and know how to fix stuff when things broke. If you want to be the person everyone goes to, you need to gain the experience and know how to solve complex problems and more importantly be able to communicate the issues and ways to solve it in a way the customer understands.",

I graduated over 2 years ago, and I had some random people from my university try to cold connect for jobs via LinkedIn. I had a million things going on in my personal life, and when I circled back, they never replied. I think you just need to build things. I’ve learned the most when something didn’t work or got broken and then fixed it. You can find tutorials/courses on how to set things up. They’re not perfect, and quality varies greatly, but what else are you going to do? Hope you can find a stranger with enough free time who is also good enough to give you free training? It does happen, but I think it’ll be very hard to find. There’s more info available than there ever has been. You can even use LLMs for some high-level guidance. Don’t wait for a perfect situation or hope someone will spoon-feed you.

And that guy had a fantastic grasp on what \"developing software with a team, and actual customers\" means despite the fact that he hadn't even interned anywhere prior to graduation. That's why we hired him, not because he wrote some cool software. He understood the software development lifecycle, and how to ship a product that customers love. The business outcomes are noticeably better compared to ticket-takers who crank out functions to spec and don't care or want to know anything about end-users.Assuming your resume looks like every other \"Junior studying computer science at a State University in the US\", I'd probably give you an interview assuming I had an opening (I don't). Timing matters; If you're the 100th resume my HRBP has forwarded since the req opened, it's probably not going to matter how good/bad your resume is because I've probably already scheduled ~8 interviews and don't need to (nor can I because of my availability) schedule any more. We'll very likely find a great intern from that initial batch of ~8 and hire them.",

I would encourage you to broaden the tech stack of your projects into some popular languages, (per TIOBE), like C, C++, Python, and Java. The harder a language is to master, the less competition there tends to be. A lot of my webdev friends are struggling to find work, but my C/C++ and embedded peers are only slightly affected by the downturn in the job market.Another thing that can differentiate a project is using project management software to drive it. Most companies use Jira or similar to track tasks. Showing familiarity with Jira, it's git integrations, and following workflows does a lot to assure companies you can be productive and provide metrics. I, personally, don't put a lot of stock in such metrics, but the people hiring sure do. In the same vein, having examples of unit tests and CI/CD are also big. It shows you've thought about the whole development process.",

For example, web technologies are not useful to what we do, but Unity/C#/C++/art/statistics/game design are. We're a relatively small company, so we often \"wear many hats\", so showing non programming skills, such as leadership/project management/QA would also be helpful. After you get the interview, showing an interest in the company and industry would be important to us, along with being a good communicator and a team player.One of my coworkers and myself recently attended a career fair at a local university,. recruiting for internships. We each had a line of candidates at least fifty people deep for over three hours. Some in the line were in completely unrelated fields trying to convince us that they could do the work.Some were people who had graduated and been looking for work for over a year and were willing to work for internship pay.Some had unrelated software skills.The people who stood out were the ones who had relevant skills and who had researched our industry and our company beforehand.

I don’t know whether many people actually pick up on it but similarly I suspect many of the metrics people provide about how they produced something that made some difficult to measure metric x% more efficient at their 2 month internship are also hyperbole.

I remember experiencing the same feeling as you when someone at work asked me about the security side of the application.

The honest answer is that it 1) takes time to get a hang on things like user stories and in general knowing the codebase and 2) don’t be afraid to ask questions.I’d say I felt really comfortable at around 1.5 years of working on the project before I stopped asking the senior dev. May seem like a lot but it’s better than pretending to know. I’d recommend making a documentation of some kind on the codebase and being diligent in recording each step taken when doing a task. Then you can refer back to your notes and eventually it starts to paint an overall picture of the code base you are working on. For example start by creating notes on the files in the code base you are most familiar with and then move on from there. Can even be 2-3 sentences if you don’t fully know - Auth.ts “This code deals with the security of client.” Eventually with good documentation will help clear things up, good luck!",

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task. This comes with time, and I find that not stressing out about unknowns is just as important as being competent in the domains you do know.",

What were your original goals with that degree? And what have you been doing since graduation? The market is bad right now (even calling it bad feels like an understatement). I've got over 3 years of professional dev experience, a master degree, published academic research in AI applications, and I was laid off 3 months ago. Over those 3 months I've been working on certs, personal projects, and applying to jobs every day. If I can’t land something by the end of the year, I’m looking at help desk, Geek Squad, or even going back into teaching programming.

Even working as a technician or line operator can open doors to better opportunities and build your network at the right companies.

The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews. If you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) If you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. You mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience. Focusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.Again this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience. Find your passion and drive yourself into it, employers will notice that more than you realize.",

Someone who just got fired for bad performance usually isn't going to go on Glassdoor and write a review that says \"Got fired, my fault, great company though!\". They're going to do everything they can to drag that company through the mud.Positive reviews are the same way. Those usually aren't very genuine either. HR often encourages their employees to leave positive reviews while they work there. Those won't be genuine either.An anecdote of mine, I was considering joining an established startup, and their Glassdoor had a bunch of reviews complaining about nepotism, and how if you aren't buddy buddy with the CEO, you'll never get good raises or get promoted.I didn't get that vibe at all when I spoke with my hiring manager, the team, a manager from another team, and the CTO. So I joined them anyways.I stayed at that company 5 long years. I got *several* of the biggest raises I've gotten in my 12 year long career there, by a pretty huge margine. I got promoted twice, including to Senior, without any action or politicking on my part, they were handed to me on merit unprompted.I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work. I don't like to chit chat, I don't like going to company happy hours. I certainly wasn't buddies with the CEO or CTO (or anyone for that matter). Doubt the CEO even knew my name. The CTO and I spoke once in a blue moon. I just went into work and did my job, and then left. And yet, huge raises, multiple promotions.Pretty sure the people that were leaving those negatives reviews didn't get good raises or promotions *because they didn't deserve them*.

I wouldn't worry so much about whether or not you worked on an application that has lots of users or made a lot of money. I would rather see a candidate at your level contributing to an open source project or their own passion project where I could see their source code.The market is difficult right now and competition is tough. I had three great candidates for the last role I hired for and could only pick one. Any of them would have done a fine job in the role, but I only had one opening.I also would still try for higher paying roles, even if you think that you're unqualified. Someone might see your resume and be willing to give you a chance,. especially if you're more affordable than the other candidates. Don't sell your skills short.If you get the interview, be passionate and knowledgeable about the company you're interviewing with. Be able to talk about the items on your resume in detail. Be a good communicator and a team player. Make the person think you're a hard worker. I know that sounds silly, but you'd be surprised at the number of candidates who I interview who only want to work with certain technologies and don't want to do anything outside of their degree.Try to be one of the first people to apply for every role you see. Candidates who apply early at my company have a huge advantage.",

You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).For example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this \"I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training.\" Of course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).Using an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. Also, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",

I literally had a goal to apply to 20 companies a day. Additionally, if you are looking for a job in a specific area, this can be even more challenging. When I was looking last year, I received more callbacks from out-of-state than in-state (California).

That problem has nothing to do with programming at all, users aren't going to use a thing just because it was programmed wellThe answers I currently give for the \"why do you want to work here\" question also don't feel good enough, usually it's just a vague thing where I say my experience lines up with the role or talk about something in the job description in more detail, but both of those don't feel like good answers and they want someone who's fanatically loyal to this random company from the very beginning when that is not me at all?",

You know how scammers try to rush their victims into making unwise decisions with a false sense of urgency? It's a technique that works. And it works really, really, really well.You're doing that to yourself right now. You're creating a false sense of urgency for yourself that doesn't actually exist. Kids, a partner, other life responsibilities ***do not*** mean you suddenly can no longer travel and your entire life is put on hold.A couple whose wedding I went to not long ago just had this first child. Wanna know what they did pretty recently? Took a 2 week vacation to Europe. They brought the kid, but *also* arranged for people to take care of their kid so they could galavant around and do \"kidless people things\". And I know people that have children that just leave them in the States and either get a parent to watch them or hire a babysitter.I will never understand the people that just put their entire lives on hold as soon as they have a kid. If that's what having a kid is like, I never fucking want kids. But luckily I have plenty of examples of people I know that have still lived their lives to its fullest even with kids. Hell, that couple I mentioned beforehand? *They travelled more than me that year*. I'm single, with no kids. And yet somehow, with a newly born child, they travelled more than me. They're living life right.I know I didn't answer your question at all, and I introduced even more questions... so apologies for that, but I think your perspective is creating a lot of issues in your mind that don't need to exist. This isn't a \"now or never\" situation. Your career shouldn't be an ultimatum of \"I can only take extended breaks when I'm unemployed\". You can have a balanced life, and a balanced career, without reaching for extremes.",

        "body": "There's a wide range in consulting companies. Some have great software practices and mentoring, and you will be doing the same work as any other developer. Others have everyone fending for themselves. You need to try to figure out which one the company you're talking to is. Another problem is if they're a smaller company, they might have fewer clients. Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. Another challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. Try to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting. Especially with less experience, you'll probably be doing more development work. Normally, the higher you are in a company, the more they want you to be doing sales. You also want to get an idea of how they get new projects, and what their project pipeline looks like.",

I will say usually when it's looking bad now, it's safe to assume to say it would look better in 3 years and the best time to get into something is when everyone is avoiding it. I get the fear of AI, but the way i see it AI will either replace jobs or can make more jobs. Like if a a team of 10 can complete 30 tasks (3 each) in a month without a AI. But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.Now if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE. I knew many kids who dropped out of CS and CE because they couldnt handle the coidng classes. Coding was much harder than they expected. In my school IT was seen as the CS dropout degree because IT had a low application rate, but a high transfer rate. Like IT courses would be empty fall of freshman year but by spring of freshman or fall of sopohemore year, the classes would be packed.",

I won't tell you what to do now since you already graduated. I would just probably plan to find a new career path if after a certain point you can't find a job. This is what the person you are responding to doesn't want to discuss. But many are having to change careers.The sad reality is their are more people applying for jobs than exist. It is also why enrollment in CS majors has dropped significantly recently across multiple colleges. People are realizing this field does not have jobs and they went into majors that actually have jobs.I guess I post this in hopes that current college students will see this and change course. Take OPs post as a warning, what your major in has consequences if that field does not actually have jobs. People trying to hide that are doing a disservice to current college grads. OP could have probably benefited from that advice if it wasn't buried so much a couple years ago. Now it is so bad that even the cope posters can't hide it anymore.",

        "body": "I've done their screening twice. Once a couple of years ago and felt about the same as you. E5 also. I passed and crushed my on-site and got an offer. Declined the offer and they actually sent me a second offer that included a much higher signing bonus and RSU grant. I still declined. The second time was more recent for a similar role as before on the same team with the same manager who remembered me and still wanted me on their team. I was interviewing as an E6 this time but I was told the initial screening was pretty much identical. I crushed the first problem and had tons of time for the second but the screener didn't understand my solution and kept interrupting me questioning my approach. I understood the approach they were suggesting and even explained it to them and why mine was actually superior and closer to real-world implementations for the specific problem presented. I tried my best to educate, and when it was clear that they just weren't going to get there I tried to power through and get my implementation in at least pseudocode hoping that either someone else would review it or the interviewer would research offline and get there eventually. That didn't happen and I was rejected. I reached out to the HM but their hands were tied by policy so I was screwed. Moral of the story is that it's highly subjective and entirely up to how the screener decides to frame the interaction.",

At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.If they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.I joined another startup \\~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things \"in the trenches\" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.In my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!If you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity. It will be a hustle, odds are much more than 50/50 that you'll end up working your ass off for something that fails, but you'll learn a ton along the way and make some good connections. The people you meet at startups are, disproportionately, the kind of professional connection that'll be really valuable to you in 5-10 years as well.",

Youre a new grad youre not expected to, but what I do on a new codebase (abridged):- look for tests and sift through them - I tend to have preexisting knowledge of the framework its using but if not I learn it a bit - I like having my first PRs being adding some tests and comments if theyre missing- know how to use your tools to search a codebase and find the answers you need when youre given a feature- ask your peers if they can walk you through the codebase a bit and take notes as they doTwo. Youre a new grad, dont worry about this. Pay attention to others around you and learn from thisThree. Ask questions when youre stuck and cant solve something, but dont be annoying asking questions every time youre stuck, and dont never ask questions and stay stuck forever. Theres a balance, and make sure you communicate to people what you tried to do to solve X (most annoying thing ever when a peer doesnt tell me that lmao)Four. Comes naturally from 1 and 3",

You arent expected to know much your first 6-12 months but at a certain point you wont be the youngest or newest person in the room so make sure you grow by then. You never know when they will start asking you questions and expect you know the answer to. \\- Ive started to use AI in my work and honestly it's really nie to understand the codebase. Use it as a pair programming tool. But dont rely on it too heavily. Make sure you understand what it's trying to convey. I have founda. few errors or things that the AI overlooks. I.e. I was trying to create a new print statement andasked the AI to go through it as it was a new field and needed to touch like 10 files. When i tested it, it wasnt working and i realized that at no point did the AI ever make sure that all the cases were covered because there was one case that would never hit because we never set that variable.\\- Ask questions and try to befriend older engineers. This is key. It's scary but you gotta play the game. The game isnt always getting as much out there, it's how your coworkers speak of you. Many jr engineers will twiddle their thumbs, SWEs hate that. Dont twiddle your thumbs, if you are stuck ask anybody. In stand up say, I am stuck. It goes a long way when you can say that openly.\\- when you complete something, show proof of it. Ask for 15 minutes post stand up to display in front of team. The team will lvoe that. \\-if you have a mentor, use that person but also try to cut the cord as quickly as you can. Ive seen jr engineers kind of cling to the mentor andwhenver they get stuck they just wait for the mentor to come back rom their 3 hour meeting even when they know where to go to but are too afraid of going themselves.",

        "body": "I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.Here are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.First of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)After that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.You need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.You need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.Security is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.Overall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",

I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.Have you done system design interviews? That will honestly cover 80% of what you need to know for BE stuff, and every cloud host has their own version of the sys design components that you’ll study. The rest is LLD (which you likely already have experience with), dev ops if needed, and testing.",
