I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved. It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on \"hard mode\" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style. Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.We are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.>How did you push through? Or did you change direction?I have always loved computers and technology. I changed careers to DE. Much happier now.",

For Python I picked up [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359/) and that helped me get a deeper understanding of the language beyond just copying code or relying on AI.

Boom - you can upgrade and rollback your business logic by just changing which image to use in Airflow's web UI.At this point, Airflow is pure orchestration. This is where it shines in my opinion and you can migrate off relatively easily because your transforms aren't tied to it.If you build all your transformation logic within Airflow, you're in for a world of pain trying to scale your Airflow cluster and deploy / test anything",

It worked well and it think can probably handle a lot more complexity than I tried with it. I’d imagine you could certainly run into limitations compared to a purely custom coded solution, but it’s nice. And when building your own you can give it the documentation and an AI tool tries to build it for you. Your mileage may vary and it didn’t really do what I wanted so I didn’t use it. The other great thing about it is that you can self host. I haven’t tried but the docs make it seems straightforward enough. Then it’s free (other than Infrastructure costs) and you don’t have the normal vendor lock in. But I’m using their hosted version because it’s easy and I’m not running enough data through it to be worth the hassle. The pricing on the hosted version seems reasonable.",

This should solve your API maintenance challenge.Your Airflow instance should only do one thing that is triggering dbt build job after Integrate completes the loads.

Also created a job to copy our raw layer tables to as there was scattering of records across micro partitions. All that we were able to reduce costs about 25%. We then implemented Keebo and saw another 20% savings, which I’m pretty sure most of it was them dynamically adjusting the suspend time on the warehouses. Most of that big saving though was we were using a warehouse that was way to big, and by sizing it down our refresh times are slight worse but it’s worth the cost improvement.",

From a Hudi angle, it is not just an open table format though. It is an end-to-end *lakehouse platform*, that integrates \"storage engine\" capabilities (much like a DBMS) with a table format (the metadata) on top of open file formats such as Apache Parquet.Hudi offers built-in services for ingestion (like Hudi Streamer), table management (clustering, compaction, cleaning, rollback), and catalog syncing. These services are deeply integrated and natively supported, allowing for fine-grained control over write-side performance (with the ability to run asynchronously/inline), recovery, and data quality. Work is also underway to add a multi-tenant caching layer that bridges fast ingestion with low-latency querying across engines. With just open table format (vs lakehouse platform), you outsource these services/capabilities to the compute/catalog layer. These literatures should shed some more light: \\- [https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/open-table-formats-and-the-open-data-lakehouse-in-perspective](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/open-table-formats-and-the-open-data-lakehouse-in-perspective)\\- [https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison)\\- [https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/03/05/hudi-21-unique-differentiators/](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/03/05/hudi-21-unique-differentiators/)",

Again I think folks don't use them properly and if they did they might like them better, but I guess it's more syntax than a simple while loop.Hot take, I don't like single quotes for both strings and to identify an instance, database, schema, object, or columns and much prefer the square brackets to differentiate one from the other.Despite best efforts to NOT be case-specific, I think there are places in SSRS or SSIS that still are (case specific). They also do weird things with instance names, like ServerName\\Instance becomes ServerName$Instance because it can't handle the slash character.SSRS went back and forth about how to pass \"All\" as a parameter between '08 and R2.I kinda fell in love with Snowflake and not having to care about strongly typing string lengths (and not having to care about SSIS crying for making everything varchar(max)).NULL and math or concatenate has surprising behavior.",

As with all dev work there's a fair amount of \"it depends\" to be had in any situation, but I can't see where this level of normalization would ever be useful inside a data warehouse.I think people pursuing this behavior have lost sight of the \"why.\" The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. Usually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. Having said all that, be careful. Myself and two colleagues were recently fired for suggesting this very thing and pointing out we shouldn't administer Snowflake like one would on-prem Oracle.",

That's how transactional databases are supposed to be. A star schema is a denormalized schema (it breaks the rules of normalization, 3NF).Your use case doesn't look very \"star schema\" to me as many to many relationships should be rare. Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how \"fast\" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.Regarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions. You need them on SCD2 dimensions, and not all dimensions need to be SCD2. You also need SK when combining data from different sources into one single dimension, and they don't have a common key.Regarding the project... 20 people working on one single star schema, 2 years. That's insane. Do you work in insurance? It sounds like something massively overengineered which goes against the premises of dimensional modeling: easy to query.",

On this sub on a nearly daily basis there is someone asking how he/she can break into DE from an analyst role. This person has no CS knowledge.The one thing I'd disagree with is pay. Generally speaking, SWE's get paid more than DE's at most companies.

The greatest benefit to it is that I often get chances to start over and build something from the ground up. As far as I know, there's less opportunity for that in the SE space and that's why I personally haven't tried making the switch. But consulting also has it's downsides. I struggle with the same things you mentioned: A lot of non-tech people who can't spell git much less use it. People handing you massive Excel sheets. Shoestring budgets with tooling. Having to explain to overconfident customers that their data is not clean. Etc.It isn't for everyone, but there's a lot of job security in it IMO.

Assuming your whole team is fundamentally competent, the frequent late nights suggest someone is promising too much and/or failing to manage expectations. The bad news is that can happen anywhere. But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.You can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)By way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.There have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.Obviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.Granted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

        "body": "Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!\". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps. Set a retention policy (e.g., 1 year hot, archive the rest) to balance auditability and your wallet.",

The delete logic with incremental loads is a nightmare we see all the time.**For the incremental vs full load problem:** Your boolean flag approach is on the right track. What works for us is having a `load_type` field (FULL/INCREMENTAL) alongside `is_current` and `last_seen_ts`. For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.The trick is tracking what constitutes a \"complete picture\" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.For cost control, consider:* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities**Quick pattern that works:*** Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliancea reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)What kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

        "body": "We did some tests where we obfuscated (hashed) names and IDs in a well known data set and then gave to candidates as a parquet file and asked them to code an ingestion/validation framework and use duckDB to return e.g. top ten sellers for the month of March or similar. Mainly we were concerned with *getting the correct answer* vs the work they did to get there. I know the answers to this test are nowhere on line. I ran a few of these by others in the dept. and they were able to do them in ~30-60 minutes. I didn't think that was entirely onerous. It was VERY clear that what was being generated was essentially random and wasn't trying to get free work, just seeing if people had the chops to do what they claimed in the interview.I suppose someone could feed the whole thing to a GPT model and ask it the questions, but...that's just a hazard these days I suppose.I agree that people trying to have candidates do full-on business case + pipeline design for free are overreaching and I would never ask that of a candidate.There's a lot of the 'fuck you pay me' attitude and that's not wrong per se, but speaking from the hiring side, if you get asked to do a 45 minute task to show you can do it and you reply with 'fuck off', well...that's a choice you can make. It will probably result in your not getting the position.",

But it works more or less the same as those hackthon coding test, it is also easy to cheat, even the question is a well crafted one, as long as the candidate has a very close friend who is a good developer. (Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do, no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it. Meaningless, the one who review you result might be even less experience than you and give a false judgement and decide to not move forward with you.",

To keep the momentum going, I'll spend XYZ time working with ABC people (if warranted) scope out the requirements to make this happen.\"The next stage is \"Requirements\" where you highlight the positives of their idea, but you also surface the potential risks that are inevitably overlooked initially. More important here when uncovering risks is getting a diverse set of perspectives as it just makes a stronger argument to have you, SWE, and DevOps bring forth risks and expected extended timelines to handle them.Once you have these well researched requirements, you then \"Iterate\" by going back to that initial champion who thought it's \"easy.\" You say something along the lines of \"I walked through the idea from a data perspective, as well as brought in XYZ teams. There is definitely excitement, but we uncovered a couple areas that I would love your feedback on in respect to tradeoffs.\" Here's the key, YOU DON'T DIRECTLY TELL THE CHAMPION WHAT TO DO (all caps because it's that important). Instead you provide them with a series of three paths forward with various tradeoffs for speed, robustness, and technical debt. You then let the champion decide AND OWN THE DECISION.Congrats, you have now turned into a partner for this champion who is not only enabling their idea, but also looking out for them to make sure mitigate any risks!The next steps are \"Build\" and \"Evangelize\" but I won't go into those as they are outside the scope of your original question.",

Based on what I've understood so far, this is definitely at least a few weeks of work for my team, because we'll first need to crank the wotsit then analyse the doohickey, before we can build the XYZ itself.If applicable, you also need to make the distinction clear between how long _once the project starts_, and the lead time _before you can start the project_. How you do that depends how projects/work items are prioritised at your place, but make sure to set expectations that the work isn't going to start right away, unless of course it can. **If you do this well, after enough repetitions, the \"easy\" people will learn more about how things work and probably won't say it any more.**### footnote(1) Honest doesn't mean as low as possible. Include padding for uncertainties, include time needed for adequate testing, documentation, etc. Honesty does include communicating the error bars on the estimate; I like Uncle Bob's approach of providing three estimates, a worst-case, best-case, and likely middle-ground. Honesty also means not being more precise than justified: eg \"a few weeks\" is better than \"3 weeks\" if you don't have enough information to be really sure it's 3 weeks.",

        "body": "Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks. I think they start their first cohort this semester.Feel free to ask any questions, I’m happy to answer where I can.",

Data engineering is very very rarely an entry level position. The two most common routes are: 1. Experienced software engineer gets experience with backend data systems and becomes a data engineer. 2. An analyst on the business side learns python and SQL to automate workflows, gets good at modeling data, and gets an \"in\" on the DE team when something opens up. My manager tends to hire type one as consultants and contractors that come and go. She hires type 2 as full time employees that stick around. So my advice is to pick a degree that sets you on one of those paths. Maybe it's terrible advice, maybe mediocre, maybe fantastic. I don't know.",

However, as you mentioned with DE not providing a solid cloud computing foundation, do you think it would be sufficient to add CS cloud computing electives. I have majority of the core curriculum taken away with AP classes which leaves decent spots for me to fill up? Also, you mentioned data engineering not being an entry level role. My original thought was by committing to a data engineering major I would be better suited to building infrastructure/data pipelines, but if that’s not an entry level role where does that leave me in the job market? I thought by having a DE major I wouldn’t necessarily have to compete with CS majors for similar jobs, giving me an edge. I apologize if these questions sound dumb, but I am trying to get the inner workings of exactly how this all fits in.

As part of our CI/CD pipeline each data product registers itself using an Api Gateway endpoint so all services are fully autonomous and independent as far development goes (ofc thanks to dagster, the full lineage chart of source dependencies is easily accessible on ui). As for storage we use Iceberg tables on S3, and Athena as SQL engine.

Lots of evals and verification as wellI found that having a flexible orchestration tool helps if you want to change technology or replace it with something else (let's say you want to replace Athena with Spark in the case of more modern tools it is easy to swap once you set it up once and it works with your orchestration), that is where we spent our innovation tokenAs for growing costs - a bit hard to say, but could it be that you can pre-compute some aggregations to not re-run some computations? Like calculate daily counts that get used to calculate monthly numbers?Also, when it comes to costs - can you look at your AWS account and try to understand what is the main driver of that increase?",

You can spend a ton of time trying things, but in the end, just keep things simple. Also, while many tools above are open source, don't fall into the trap of setting up everything yourself.

We tried Airflow and it was way too time consuming to set it up and manage. Perfect was extremely simple and just worked. The underlying approach of the two is still the same.Go Databricks if you are looking to stay very close to your AWS account. Check out Snowflake on AWS in the same region your current AWS Org/Account if you're looking for greater flexibility in the future. Both are roughly the same cost.If you're analysts are well versed in SQL then Databricks or Snowflake are great solutions. If they are not SQL experts check out analytics platforms like Sigma that natively leverage the strengths of cloud data warehouses. We use Sigma and it's a great analytics tool first and foremost.

Some code-heavy DEs might be able to to it, but most of us are using SQL or dbt or something like that. Traditional software testing does not work for us. We have to think differently. That pedantic message aside, we can take the concept of unit tests and apply to data engineering. We need three things. 1. Known input state (What data are we reading)2. Work (Query, task, function, something that transforms data)3. Know expected output stateDbt and SQLMesh do this with their own concept of unit tests. I'm sure other platforms have their own solutions. If you want to roll your own it is fairly simple in theory.... 1. Create known data that shows the characteristics of what you want to test.2. Run the portion of your pipeline that you want to test.3. Compare the output to the expected output. If it matches you are good. This is not that hard in small pipelines, but very difficult to maintain in big pipelines. Imagine a SaaS company with 10 subscription plans and negotiated contracts. New stuff being added every day. 800 data sources. It's really tough to maintain a test suite. This problem has not been solved in the industry and whoever solves it will be very rich.

This makes it easy to write unit tests where you pass mock inputs into transform functions and compare output to expectation. From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.This separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.So in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output. You’ll be confident it’s processing and validating as expected because the function itself is covered.",

Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby.

A lot of folks in data look to deepen their finance knowledge, but the CFA might not be the most direct route if your goal is to stay in data engineering.CFA is a serious time and energy investment. It’s incredibly valuable if you’re aiming to become a portfolio manager or financial analyst who makes investment decisions—but for a data engineer, the overlap is limited. Most technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA. What they *do* value is domain familiarity: understanding how financial data works, how to build pipelines for it, and how to surface insights that support the business.A more practical route might be building out your finance knowledge in parallel with your engineering work. Things like:* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation modelsThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials. If you're interested, we’ve got some finance-focused tracks that lean technical: Python for Finance, Financial Modeling in Excel, and Financial Analysis in Power BI. They can give you the right foundation without going all-in on CFA.That said, if you’re considering a career shift toward investment roles or product strategy, the CFA might be worth it—but it’s rarely a game-changer on the engineering side.",

When you do this, add two extra columns: start_date and end_date. Set the start_date to the day you ran the first scraping job (let's call it D), and set the end_date to something far in the future (like the year 9999) to indicate it's still \"active.\"Now, when you run your second scraping job (on day D+1), compare it to the data already in the table:* If a listing is new (wasn't in the first file): insert it as a new row, with start_date = D+1 and end_date = 9999.* If a listing no longer appears: update the existing row in the table to set its end_date = D. This marks it as no longer active.* If a listing is still there but has changed (e.g., price or details): treat it like a delete and reinsert. That means: Update the existing row's end_date = D, AND Insert a new row with the updated values, start_date = D+1, and end_date = 9999.If you already have a historical mass of scraped data, you keep going day by day until your current date. You then schedule your job to run right after the scraper to update the table with your new data.If this sounds confusing, look up Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) It’s a standard data warehousing method for tracking changes over time. The advantage is that you can use those columns you added to answer your questions.",

It is usually good practice to not have transformation/normalisation and database update from the scraping process directly, although for small projects; do whatever ofc if reliability and reproducibility is not critical... For slowly (and sometimes platform dependent) changing IDs, you need an entity recognition process. There are multiple ways to achieve this, but you can often end up in a n^2 problem of comparisons. This is often dealt with using blocking keys ( think zip code, property categories etc), this way you get smaller n^2 problems. You can in addition/or involve embeddings or fuzzy matching logic approaches on top to determine duplicates / narrow comparisons. Best of luck and have fun",

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive.

But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails. I know the Google genai and openai APIs both have functionality to do this kind of workflow.Good luck",

        "body": "I've done between 150 and 200 of these animals. The process is very similar regardless of the tools. Let me give you the high points. The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. \"Because we've always had them\" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. Generate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future. These things stay around a long time.",

If you are on AWS for instance, you need to build a Powerbi gateway to talk to Azure where the dashboards and data will sit, so you are paying probably for a scaling cluster depending on your projected usage. Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible. If you do it by caching on the Azure side for performance, then it requires you to move all the potential data that people could use across to make it available. You could also use direct query, where it queries every time someone refreshes. You only pay for the same query compute once a day because Snowflake caches the results, but you still move the data to Azure every time. So it has an impact on your gold data architecture, how you develop your data products and the extent to which you have decentralized access to a variety of data. Personally after using Powerbi for about a year after migrating off another platform, I would pick a different one that plays nice with your cloud and is more accessible to the business at large.",

Incremental Airbyte syncs plus dbt’s stateful models keep data volumes down; full reloads should be the rare exception. Kestra can kick off a Snowflake task that flips the warehouse to Medium only for heavy transforms, then shrinks it back. Use resource monitors with hard fail at 80% of monthly budget and track spend with the Snowflake usage view piped back into PowerBI. For SharePoint pulls, land the files in cheap object storage first and stage into Snowflake external tables to avoid compute on every file read. After trying Fivetran and Matillion for finance data, DualEntry handled multi-entity consolidations without blowing up credit usage. Dial in governance early and the setup will stay affordable as they scale.",

But I wouldn't expect a senior position to provide projects, generally our work is owned by the companies and repositories are private; and we've stopped doing \"presentable\" projects outside of work. I have multiple friends in various industries looking for work, including a previously staff backend engineer from Instagram and they're all having a hard time. I know that doesn't help but looking for work is soul crushing, and legally it's in the companies best interest to give you zero feedback on why they went with someone else. Also if you don't mind shorter projects (still FTE) but 3-6mo projects don't skip applying for the major cloud vendor PSO companies. At those companies \"YOU\" are the product so they can often be hiring when others aren't. Hope something comes your way soon!",

It comes with GCP/Azure/AWS, the accounts are short lived but last I checked you could still spin up some pretty expensive products like GCP's Spanner, Redshift, etc. Another reason, if you do something \"stupid\" that would generate a massive bill. You only paid 35 bucks and it's in their sandbox. I think you're allowed 10ish cpu cores of raw ec2 instances at a time. When linux academy was bought by cloud guru the courses became a shell of what they were and became very heavily designed towards passing certifications so I can't vouch for any of the training that comes with it.

Pick one small goal (like replicating an ETL you’ve already built), and use your credits just for that. Document what you do—it’s great for your portfolio.* **Databricks Community Edition** is another solid option—it’s limited, but you can still get a feel for Spark + notebooks in a cloud environment.* **Mock cloud architecture projects**: Even if you can’t spin up real services, diagram out what you would build. Treat it like a case study: describe the data flow, tools you'd use, how you'd deploy and monitor it, etc. Interviewers love seeing your thinking.* **Volunteer work or open-source projects**: Some nonprofits or small data teams are happy to have help setting up basic pipelines. It’s a longer shot, but worth exploring if you’re on LinkedIn or GitHub.",

I imagine keeping everything in one region(and so in one metastore) is good from a security and ingress/egress perspective BUT from a data code perspective it feels odd (wrong) that I need to parameterise my catalog/database name in my sql/python code. Maybe it’s just my mindset which comes from having identical databases across servers and only having to parameterise names at cicd deployment time.",

It'd be impossible to make a full determination of the best way to model this without knowing the data much more intimately than I ever could via Reddit. However, my first reaction to your department/location example, is that if there are (relevant) properties of the intersection between these, they are not two separate dimensions. They are one dimension. Are you familiar with the concept of Junk dimensions? That might be what's relevant here. Combining Department and Location would be a pretty typical junk scenario, assuming you don't have many thousands of rows for either.",

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.Again, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example. However, on an already ongoing application, that solution would not be optimal.",

It's probably currently better described as a \"SQL query engine\", than a full database.Warp skips: \\- transactions \\- updates/deletes \\- indexing \\- joins (although it could one day) \\- writes are also currently append onlyThe idea was to strip it down to a minimal feature set to unlock extreme speed. That's really all that's required for dash boards, real-time searches and fast lookups etc. I'd imagine people would output a pre-processed table from a daily pipeline, ingest it into Warp, then query it throughout the day.",

For example, Warp is benefiting greatly from the OS caching disk data: \\- Cold reads (from disk) hit around 5GB/s \\- Warm reads (from cached pages) can hit 200GB/s+Curious how large you're thinking? If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \\~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).It's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes. I've tried to keep it small so it's cheap to run (I suspect a lot of cloud users are paying more than they need to for their small/mid data sizes). However, def keen to learn more about what real users expect!",

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. And there's different philosophies of design (\"in memory\" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).Some (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).You're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot. One of my colleagues posted this recently: https://datamonkeysite.com/2025/07/21/does-a-single-node-python-notebook-scale/Single nodes have gotten very powerful. But then again, smalk workloads don't always stay small. Having room to grow is good too, as is not having it be \"works on my machine\".I work on a distributed, autoscaling OLAP database engine (Fabric Warehouse) that's capable of efficient single node execution, or scale out, depending on what the query needs. So I'm not necessarily convinced one really has to choose between small scale efficiency and being capable of going distributed. But at the same time, you've already got a huge project on your hands as it is. It's a very interesting space, with lots of hard problems and competition. Good luck!",

Our official SLA is 3 hrs but in reality we process the data in around an hour tops end-to-end. The input is approx 500 JSON files a minute, essentially a new version of each business object in each file, and the output is 280+ delta tables. We use only custom-built pyspark notebooks to accomplish this, no DLTs, with a combination of continuous batch job workflows and ADF-triggered readstream workflows that run for 24 hrs then time out using a query listener to recycle and restart during off-hours.The first crux of the data feed is to transform the incoming JSON into a collection of 280+ tabular and relational “bronze” tables. This first crux is the essential schema transformation from an object-oriented data view to an analytical and relational-database view of the data. No data contents are modified, only the schema representation.The second crux is the creation of a merge statement from the collection of “bronze” tabular tables to the final collection of “silver” tables. We have 6 workflows that run this second part with about 75 tasks for the big ones, 20 for the smaller ones, that all use a status table as a readstream to know when parsed, tabular data is ready to merge into the final silver tables. Each task is responsible for keeping one final silver table updated. Think of it as laminar data flow.Not sure this helps since you seem to be receiving tabular data from the start, but seemed like our situation might have enough commonalities to describe here.Good luck!",

They have released a new product with a rust based engine called fusion that has a modified license to avoid other companies leveraging and reselling their work. There is supposed to be both a free cli version (registration required but no cost) and the premium version through the cloud or premium cli. Yes semantic models are gated behind the premium license. They also are sort of limited in that you can't build a full model with multiple tables, each semantic model is 1:1 with a dbt model, which is one table or view. If you use an obt data structure then you are good. If you have a star schema or something like that that you want to represent semantically then it doesn't work. We wanted to to do a PBI on top of dbt thing too, but ultimately just built a big model in PBI because it did what we needed it to. There are a few other options out there right now like Cube and Snowflake just released a few options if you use that platform. There isn't Snowflake to PBI integration yet though.[https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine)",

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.Here's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.For context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.If you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.Just something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

But since they announced fusion they still work on core.Also their DBT-fusion licensing is quite complexe. It’s like you can use it for like an open source software but not too much. Not sure the community really likes what they did with this.We will see how they manage this but currently they have those 3 products (core, fusion, cloud) which they support.Their cloud thing is good to have some extra feature that they didn’t include in core like DBT mesh and catalog, but it’s quite bad for orchestration, so you pay for something you will try to orchestrate another way….

To me it sounds like maybe you should extract specific standardized information from each pdf to a database and then you can use it to filter information, for example, using an llm to detect and classify project locations, sizes, cost at the time, and other related information, include source document and page, and for all location questions this should be used as a kind of index, I guess an llm reading each document and creating a json, you would need a validation for the structure of the output so it is consistent for all.The same for other subjects like names of people, locations (you can use a NER model like Stanza), tables, photos, designs, and so on, with this in place, maybe it is easier to identify which parts of each document has the information needed to answer a question and can be pdf raw fed to, for example, a Gemini query to answer the question or to simply used the gathered information in the database to answer. I am not sure that using pdfs and a chatbot is the best aproach for this though, seems to me that there should be a primary source of all that information and it should be collected and written in a database, and maybe some of these questions are some dashboards that should be built, but I don't have enough information of your context.",

That's one more layer of complexity that may or may not be required.* You may be able to batch often enough to be real-time enough for the business without streaming (they need to define real-time)* We're looking at Prefect more than Airflow, especially the cloud version because it's fairly cheap for our needs and having the local worker is easy to setup. We are not planning on using PySpark though, probably sqlMesh or something in thata category.",

        "body": "* Yep, you're right. Right now we separate everything at the server and database level. Each customer has their own dedicated postgresql database on either a server we host or on-prem. We don't have multi-tenancy yet and we're actively debating whether to keep that model or move toward a centralized setup as I mentioned in the original post.* We're a team of 3 full-time engineers, including 2 senior data engineers. And that's the final headcount, the company is not planning to hire any more DEs.* Regarding maintenance, deployment, monitoring, it's fully on us and that's why we thought of managed services. There's no separate devops team or anything alike... so whatever we build, we’ll be responsible for keeping it alive and running.* We’re actually trying to shift toward an ELT model. The idea is to extract raw data from files, APIs, and databases, load it into PostgreSQL staging tables, and then apply transformations in the warehouse. That said, we don’t believe SQL alone is enough for our use case. Some transformations require logic that’s cleaner and more maintainable in code. Plus, we want to avoid overengineering with a million CTEs etc. We’ve been leaning toward PySpark not just because of current needs, but because it gives us room to scale if needed later on... With that being said, we never used PySpark and whatever I say is what I was able to find out during my research over the last few weeks.* Real-time is loosely defined. Right now, management calls it live if data arrives within 5 minutes. For things like revenues, daily is fine. But for occupancy data for instance, we load every few minutes and customers already want it faster (ideally under 1 second if possible). So while it’s not a hard requirement today, have \"real\" live data either through streaming or batch is likely on the horizon, and we want to stay flexible.* Thanks for mentioning Prefect and sqlMesh. I hadn’t looked at those yet. We’re more familiar with Airflow, but open to alternatives, especially if they’re easier to operate in a small team setup. I’ll definitely take a closer look!",

Similar story with static analysis, although I suppose this is what you might be using it for. Looking for better (and more) static analysis tools might be a good idea, then. Getting a linter and similar tools is a lifesaver for syntax issues on the static stage of coding.100% on reading code and using debugger, I'd say any minute on deepening your debugger proficiency will pay off very, very quickly.",

If you can, well placed prints/logs/LED blinks can do the same thing though (bonus for not changing what your code does other than side effects or timing)And really, 500 lines of code should probably be broken up into smaller routines so you shouldn't have to tackle it all at once, anyways.> 2.

Not knowing how to do something causes a lot of novices to freeze up and panic, but for a programmer, every problem always starts with \"I don't know how to do this.\" Programming is about where to go from that common starting point.

        "body": "What is it that people generally struggle with? It took me about a month (full time) to go from understanding practically nothing about programming, to being a passably competent junior developer, back around 10 years ago.I did spend a lot of my teen years building and tinkering with computers, and I was able to make static websites, but that was all I knew going into it. Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.I knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.I wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.I looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.Then I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.After that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.Honestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. I know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.I’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!If someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!As for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.I do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. If I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time.

        "body": ">I'm completely unable to \"think like a programmer\".But it can be learned.>They're right, thinking like a programmer IS the hard part. Yes, it is, but as said, it can be learned. What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.You wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:- Problem: \"I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.\"Distill the core:- array of words- count how often- word- write to screenTo do this, I need:- An array of words (so I must define this).- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)- To Write the result to the screenSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {decide if you counted the word before}print_result(keep_count)```Now you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was \"decide if you counted a word before\", so that's what you do next:```if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}```So now you put that solution into the previous block of code:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```Then refine it a bit:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {keep_count for word: increase by 1} else {keep_count add word: set to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```And you're done. You've written your program. Now you only need to translate it into the language you are using. A large part of the starting year of a computer science education is actually learning to do this, starting with small things like this and increasing the scope of the problems you're solving. Alongside this you'd learn about often-used data structures and algorithms.Repeat this again and again for years and years on end and you'll get good at it.This is a skill that can be learned, but not in \"Javascript bootcamp\". The above is programming; \"javascript bootcamp\" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.You always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",

Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt. If you are so dependent on a tool, that you cannot do anything without it, and you cannot problem solve or think for yourself, then why is someone going to hire you. What value do you bring. What education did you acquire. So longer answer yes. Your classmates are cooked.",

I never use full fat copilot / multi-line completion, but even so, getting back into writing every character myself was a big hurdle.If you're competing against your classmates, they're going to struggle to approach this, much less explain their reasoning.Some companies embrace AI assistance, and your peers might peform reasonably well at take-home assessments given their limited scope and generic problem statements, but once they need to defend their decisions to a panel of seniors, then yes they're probably cooked.As for actual job competence, I cant say with certainty, as I havent worked with the new generation of juniors. However, I can guarantee you that the hard part of this job is not writing boilerplate; it's building a mental model of your codebase and designing systems that work well with it, taking its limitations and invariants into consideration. You're practicing this, while they are not.",

        "body": "If AI can write code, it can run a company.If there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.Currently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.The issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.There's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.So it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because \"AI could do their job.\" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.These companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.A lot of these companies were also \"benching\" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.Realistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.Meanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.If an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.That said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.I think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.When AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.You may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.Advances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.Realistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.My theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.My recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot. It will probably be easier for you to get a job.",

But I have some great connections in these community banks that will help us to approach them quickly at least in an entire city .Need guidance from some of the experienced people .The indian community bank market is growing, there is a very big market . We know the problems and issues they are facing and as those problems are modern we require modern solutions (and we have the solution)but most of the employees in this kind of bank are the retired corporate employees or either providing free community service after their occupational work and that's why they are trying to solve the issue with traditional ways or just trying to cop-up their work with the issue but they are not able to solve those issues completely .I can share my progress on the app , the issue , the solution everything.

I check the hourly report to see if there's going to be rain at the hours I'll be biking.I could have an app that does that for me and emails me in the morning whether I should bike or drive that day. This would teach me how to query an api for information, build a response, and then email that out. I'd also need to figure out how to host this script somewhere that can run automatically at defined times. So it's not a \"problem\" that's being solved, it's a task that I do manually that's repetitive and has a straightforward logical flow with defined inputs and outcomes.

        "body": "> So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. It's a bit more nuanced, but lets say this is kind of true.In any case, at the lowest level that is worth talking about, it's possible to connect some wires to the CPU/microcontroller and directly influence the electricty. But usually people don't do that, because both the computer/environment and the programming part have multiple levels of abstraction.First: The computer has \"firmware\" built in, which is basically small existing software that is part of the hardware components. One of its features is also that, when you turn the computer on, it loads other software from some predefined place (ie. the 0/1, or rather 0-255, that are stored there), and continues with executing this - so that you don't need additional physical wires to control your computer. This other software, that is loaded, can be called operating system (OS). And the OS then also doesn't do \"everything\" with 0/1 directly, but can give some known commands to the firmware (that the firmware understands).This data that is the operating system, you could create the 0/1 manually. But again people don't really do this. There is \"assembly\", which is a very basic, hardware-dependent programming language. There are commands like eg. MOV and PHMINPOSUW, no convenient loops, classes or anything like that. A helper program called assembler translates such a program to the binary data that can be executed.And, for both manual-binary or assembled programs, there's also the question of the environment that it runs in. Should it be an operating system that works directly with the hardware/firmware? Or should it run \"within\" an existing operating system, where it doesn't get to access the hardware anymore, but can access things provided by the OS?As next level, languages like C/C++/COBOL/Rust/.... Here you get compilers that translate this programming language into assembly. These languages are less hardware-dependent, instead you get different compilers for different hardware platforms (producing assembly for their specific platform). Once again, it's important to decide if you want to make an OS, or a program to run on an existing OS like Windows or Linux. The code will be quite different. As you know C, you surely know things like printf - that's not something the hardware and assembly can do, it's part of an existing OS (and it's libraries). When writing C to make an OS, you have to make your own printf too, by using firmware things that allow you to contorl the screens output.ObjC etc. are not C, please don't confuse them.Next level are languages like Kotlin, as you expected. With Kotlin, Java, C# and so on, there is no compiler that directly produces assembly anymore. It's technically possible to create such a thing, but no one is doing it. Compiling to C code is possible too, but again unusual. Instead they have their own compiled program format, that is unrelated to what the hardware can understand. And in addition to the compiler, they need a second helper program (written in C etc.), that during each execution takes this custom binary format and each time \"translates\" it to real native things on the fly. It might sound weird, but there are advantages too (and disadvantages too).",

Sometimes you need to use an existing language like C/C++ to write the first compiler for a new language and then you can use that first compiler to compile a compiler written in the new language.

This is all very valuable.\\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Well, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.So should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.I personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.What should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.There are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of \"systems jobs\".To qualify for them, you need good system understanding.

You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Yes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say \"well i don't want to learn web dev\" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.There are backend, front end and full stack roles. Look at whats in demand near you but i imagine you'll see more full stack/backend than just dedicated front end roles these days (At least i do in my area).>Anyone else been through this? How did you figure it out?If you enjoy programming and building stuff, you should stick with it and learn a more marketable skill within the domain.

When you have a problem, search for your answer on docs or stackoverflow/forums and find the answer yourself. You will learn so much more this way, and have a deeper understanding. Sometimes, if you don't know what to search, AI can be useful to help you put a name to your problem, and then you can search based on that. Knowledge is valuable. Don't offload your learning! \\- To form a deep understanding, there's no substitute for hours working on projects. Just keep doing it. If you find somebody you can team up with, even better! Maybe there's an open source project you can contribute to, or something you can start. Collaborating with others is a great way to keep things fun, and gain valuable feedback on your code.\\- Don't give up! Technology is a competitive field. But if you enjoy the work and are excited to do it, you will succeed. You just have to care and try. You'll get there!If you need feedback on projects, ask. Many people are always happy to lend a helping hand, myself included!",

        "body": "I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\\- I would center my approach around the concept of \"how computers work and how to think systematically\". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around \"how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?\" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be \"How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't \"programming\" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to \"Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps\". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \\- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \\*argv\\[\\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(\"Hello World\");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \\- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(\"Hello World\"), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",

Now I do more tech strategy and communications on a team that is not really technical. You’ll be surprised at the opportunities that can come from having these skills, so I like to think of programming as a skill, not a job. With a basic understanding and a desire to put it to work, choose your areas of focus carefully. It’s tempting to dive into a little bit of everything, but in my experience, especially with newer people, they offer more to a team when they come in with some capability in a certain role. You can always learn what you need to about other areas on the job, but if you decide you like front end stuff, dive into it and do it strategically. Maybe ask an AI what front end frameworks are in the highest demand right now… pick one, like react, and learn it well. The sooner you can start contributing something to a team, the better. Too often we see juniors in our world who are smart and capable but need too much handholding, so coming in with a real understanding of what you’ll be contributing to and you’ll be shocked at how grateful senior people are to skip the handholding phase.",

For example: put(stderr, \"x = \"); put(stderr, x); put(stderr, \"\\n\");> The type of the argument determines which \"put function\" will be invoked for each argument. However, this is too verbose. The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a \"put to\" operator, looks like this: cerr << \"x = \" << x << \"\\n\";> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.So basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.In modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",

Yes, auto date = 2025y / 7 / 23:face_vomiting:. These are all terrible, hard to read and hard to use. Absolutely awful designs, all of them.

In C, if you have a block of code which reads from a `FILE*` you can pass it `stdin` and it will work.

Printf is really annoying since you have to match placeholders to variables. And you cannot overload a function with all combinations of types and lengths. And you don’t want to call print separately in each piece of output. Almost every language struggles with it and does smth strange.Scripting languages and similar use all kind of var interpolation. And rely on checking var type at runtime - can’t do in c/c++. Java uses weird trick with + which suddenly calls toString() behind curtains. How is that reasonable - it’s the only implicit thing in Java. At least in first versions. Python secretly calls `_repr_` but Python does many strange things. Also, notice how Python moved from print with commas separating args (and ugly way of controlling formatting with `sep=` to variable interpolation with `{}`. C++ found a pretty clean way to do it using operators. And it’s more reasonable to put `cout <<` at the beginning. I think technically you can put cout at the end of expression by using right associating operator but why bother. Assignment works right to left, why not output.",

I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.In terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.However, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.What I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.For anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons. It’s especially helpful for people who like learning through doing, rather than watching endless tutorial videos.",

        "body": "Thanks for sharing your experience! I’ve been testing out Codefinity myself, and I think it’s a pretty underrated option for learning to code especially for anyone starting out with Python or just dipping their toes into programming. If you're searching for an honest Codefinity review, here’s my take::check_mark_button: **What I liked**:* The platform is clean and beginner-friendly. No need to install any software—you can code right in your browser, which saves a ton of setup time.* The course structure is well-paced. Lessons are short, interactive, and easy to digest without feeling overwhelming.* The built-in AI assistant is a nice touch. It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.:magnifying_glass_tilted_left: **Things to be aware of**:* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.:bullseye: **Why I’m using Codefinity**:My goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.Overall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.Curious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs? Are there better alternatives for learning Python step by step?Let’s make this a helpful thread for anyone researching Codefinity reviews or trying to choose the right coding platform in 2025.",

JavaScript has so many broken things inside the language itself. (Well Python also, but not as many.)",

Then use Python console that takes your input for a food: you type Pizza and it shoots out the recipe.Boom a simple project done and dusted, now let’s say you want the recipe to be dynamic? Connect it to a database. See if it still works with your simple console. Now that you got a database you might want fancier UI. Start adding tkinter or even more advanced modern UI to display your recipes.Do incremental updates little by little and you’ll have a whole code base for your project.Now where do you learn all of this? In today’s age: Google, Stack Overflow, YouTube, ChatGPT, etc. anything that helps you understand and build it.Figure out if you’re a practical learner or a reader or a writer etc. your learning style will decide hugely on how you like to learn and where you get your resources from.",

        "body": ">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a \"mental block\", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of \"my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on\" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. \"It's better to stop trying than to risk failure\", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that \"I don't get it\" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think \"how do I avoid this?\" but it's more productive to instead think \"how do I process this and learn from it?\" - because it is gonna keep happening.When your brain wants to say \"I don't get it\", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning. What tool can I use to get past this obstacle? How have I managed these situations before? Am I hammering my forehead against a wall here; and if so, can I change strategy rather than getting more upset it isn't working?",

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc. Figuring it out yourself is ALWAYS better than following a tutorial.",

        "body": "It's definitely a shift when you go from an intro programming tutorial where you to have a sequence of things to learn to building a project where you learn as you go. I'll give an example:My first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a \"main\" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.So you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.If you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python. (If you want to stick to Javascript, there's NodeJS on the backend, but I've never used it myself.) You could also do something that's pure frontend but still fairly involved like making a single-player game.",

Quite often, many new people think the test is purely technical like taking a test, and that's probably mostly right, but personality can be a deciding factor.* Practice interview situations. Have someone ask you technical questions (code this up) as well as more people-related stuff (\"What is your greatest weaknesss?\").* Apply to a lot of places and expect a lot of rejections. Take notes afterwards about what went well and what didn't.* Keep in mind your perception of interviews and their perception could be quite different. You could have done really well in your mind, but maybe they had no plans to hire and so you didn't get picked, or they nitpicked on a resume. You could have done badly in your mind, but they think it went well. * Work on your interview skills. Learn how to project positivity and be upbeat even if you aren't (mostly a first impression kind of thing)",

However tools, libraries and frameworks change all the time. These you have to learn some new at almost every project. But you can still master programming in general even on new tools and frameworks.Programming is probably the most complex we humans do. There are huge amounts of knowledge to learn in programming only. And now I don't count languages, libraries, tools or frameworks. The levels of mastery in this craft is crazy. I count myself as a professional and very experienced, and I master quite advanced C++ code but when I compare myself with some guys on the C++ forums I feel like a beginner again. There is always something even more advanced to learn. Programming needs more levels than beginner, intermediate and advanced.",

Yes, you can do that using a debugger, but often times all one needs is to print out a line \"What is this variable at this one point?\". Debuggers are conversely extremely handy, because you can walk a program up to the point (see \"breakpoint\") where you have the bug, and output all of the variables/etc that are likely wonky. Aside from that, a mindset that has helped me in my work is to think about side effects. \"If I change a thing in part A, what does that do to part B?\" and working to better encapsulate logic/steps so that generally doesn't happen, as it's generally a bad thing that makes debugging much harder.",

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.Debugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

Debugging is all about critical thinking.Learn how to use a debugger, and add logging to your program.

        "body": "That's the wrong approach. Randomly changing things will likely break stuff.Here's the analogy. Imagine you have a car (and I'm no mechanic), and it's having some issues. You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.Do you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.In a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.Because I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.It's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.OK, so some steps.**Determine why you think your program is broken**I've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.What they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? This is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?**Try a smaller input**The next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).The first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).**Test your functions**A smaller version is to test functions. Determine* what are the input parameters* given certain input values, what are the output values**Write more small functions**Instead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.Write a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.**Test as you go along**Don't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

        "body": "Whoa there's a lot to be said here. But I'm in a somewhat similar situation at the moment and quite burned out, so I'll try to cover all the important stuff:1. Whatever you want to do (career change, learn new stuff, etc), ensure you have a way to sustain yourself. In this case, \"sustain yourself\" could mean leaving your current job and living off savings for a while... Enumerate your options and pick any option that works for you. There may be multiple correct answers and multiple wrong answers1. Using one extreme case as an example: let's suppose you choose to stay at your current job and try to learn new things in parallel (this is more or less your current situation). Realize that your bandwidth is limited and the more burned out you are, the faster you will subsequently burn out if you don't let up on the pressure. 1. Learning while on the job: if you are able to draw a connection between your current job and programming, you might be able to pitch it as a professional development exercise to gain employer support1. I recently read [an article about Amazon employees reading 1-4h every day][amazon-reading]. Maybe there's something to it and your daily reading could be programming1. Learning programming is less about reading and more about fiddling/tinkering. At least for me, the learning correlated more with practice than reading earlier on. Later in my practice, I was able to learn more from reading than I was previously able to, but tinkering (trying out new ideas that I've read about) has always been part of my learning loop.1. it sounds like consistently finding bandwidth is an issue. Consider that your learning journey could be slow and bursty. So read about a small topic today and practice it for 10min. Practice it again tomorrow for 10min. Maybe you'll have more bandwidth day after, so practice it for 25min. The following week, start the next topic. In this example, I mean \"topic\" to be something as simple/small/atomic as list slicing. Adopting this strategy will keep you within your available bandwidth (and thus avoid/mitigate burnout), but it is slower than (for example) a bootcamp or a structured course.1. Eventually (on like a long weekend or something), try building a side project. Once you start down this path, two things happen: (1) you'll start trying to apply all new concepts to your project and (2) your project becomes your guiding light for what to learn next. This second thing is a super powerful driving force in helping you learn new and useful things.1. Remember always to listen to your burnout meter. You can't learn if you're burned out. It's counterintuitive and difficult to implement, but if you're feeling the early stages of burnout, STOP. Write out your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of paper... or record yourself on TikTok; find a way to externalizing your ideas so that you're not constantly ruminating over them when your brain is asking for a break (I used a notebook and a pen... I guess I'm old school like that).I'll stop for now (my brain needs a break), but feel free to ask followup questions and I'll be happy to answer to the best of my ability[amazon-reading]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/former-amazon-principal-engineer-says-he-spent-1-4-hours-reading-daily-and-it-s-part-of-the-company-s-secret-sauce/ar-AA1Iw4QO",

GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:> - security purposes> - automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service> - to assist the repository owner with a support matter> - to maintain the integrity of the Services, or> - to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.> GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.And there's no mention anywhere else in the privacy statement about them training Copilot on your private repositories. So unless you believe one of the most valuable companies in the world (Microsoft) is outright lying in their privacy statement, then you can not worry about this possibility.Legal policies can't play games like assuming everyone knows Copilot training on private data is part of \"the integrity of the Services\" - they have to be explicit.If you think they are outright lying or twisting words, then I guess you should immediately stop using any Microsoft products, and consider any information you've ever entered to be public.Similarly, GitHub once mentioned that \"no human eyes\" will ever see the code from your private repositories. A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games. Your private repositories are reviewed by some kind of machine, because that's how GitHub indexes your repositories for you! That way you can search for keywords and symbols, and so on. How else would they do that?Ultimately: your code isn't worth the risk to Microsoft. There are already hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of public repositories for them to use.",

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.Some members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother. I didn't learn anything I wasn't familiar with already from work and personal research, and some aspects of what was taught would actively hinder my job if I tried implementing them as it would slow productivity to a crawl.I did mine part-time, I can't imagine doing it full-time. If you have already got the ability, and you have some way to show it, I really don't think a degree is going to change things any more than spitting in the ocean. The times I've had bigger offers have all been because they've seen something I've done and liked it, but I've never had anyone stop to mention the lack of degree, or ask about it since I got it.Of course, I imagine different goals and different locations might change that, from my understanding, large multinationals tend to like degrees, but I'd rather switch to a different career than work for any of them.",

Yes, you should work hard - but whether that means \"get a paid job\" or \"aim to get a high grade\" or \"learn Python\" or \"learn French\" or \"brush up on your maths\" or \"do some volunteering\" or \"learn interview skills\" or one of a million other things depends on you. All of those things are good, and different employers will value different skills, and no one person can do them all.You also shouldn't forget about the rest of your life - family, friends, relationships, hobbies, rest, eating well, sleeping well, etc. No point in being the most skilled engineer in your company if you burn out at age 30, or have a heart attack at 40, or regret not starting a family at 50, or whatever.It's a lot to juggle.

In fact, you as an engineer have no reason to learn programming at all, unless you find it fun and want to learn it. And, if you do need it, you can learn it on the job or right before interviews, or just fake it. Trust me engineering firms do not care, they only care that you understand engineering principles, that you have developed your gut feeling through apprenticeship at various firms. Even if you don't become an engineer, there is still no reason to do programming because engineering is where the work will be at in the future, not programming. Programming is technically dead at this point. It will be back just not in its current form. As long as you have a good understanding of the engineering principles and practices, you can carry that knowledge into any field and use that unique perspective to solve things that only you can solve with your own perspective.",

You'll probably find that well-established projects have their own coding standards and customs that you'll need to learn.If you're creating your own project, go for it! Put it in a public Github repo and give it an appropriate license. I like the MIT license because it is least restrictive on users. The GNU Public License (GPL) is also good, partly because lots of open-source stuff is already licensed that way. If you use that stuff, you need to use the GPL yourself.Thanks for being part of the open-source movement!",

In my experience, when I started working as a developer, they gave me time to study the project I was being put on and to read the docs about the frameworks, libraries, and technologies they were using. Nobody expects you to start a revolution in the company, I think that, most of the time, as a junior dev you just need to show that you're there to learn and become productive. Also, if a company is looking for a fullstack developer, it would be strange to go there and say something like: \"*Yeah, I wanna be fullstack, but right now I'm too scared. Can I start with frontend? :folded_hands:\".* Just go in and say that you have no experience, they'll understand that they can’t assign you the hardest tasks in the company.",

However, C# can be used in game engines like Unity.Saying it's the \"best\" for game design is hard to prove. There are many choices that are arguably better, depending on your goals. That said, it's a good language to learn if game design is your ultimate goal.As for tips:- Don't use AI.- If you use AI anyway, don't ask it to generate code and paste it in without understanding what it does.- Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Just try things.- I wouldn't jump straight into game dev. Try to get a basic understanding of the language with console apps or Windows Forms first.C# is a \"typed\" programming language. Every variable you define has a \"type.\" IE: ints are numbers, strings are text, chars are letters. You can use or define more complex types. For example, you could have a variable called \"player\" with a complex structure to represent the player's position, velocity, health, etc.C# is a \"managed\" programming language. You don't have to worry about directly allocating memory, or cleanly exiting your app— that's all handled for you.",

But it also depends on your country, it's not the same everywhere.If you really want to be a computer science engineer or work in cybersecurity, depending on how things are in your country, you're probably going to have to put in a significant amount of work in your resume and may need to apply to quite a few jobs just to get one.It's harder to land a profession today than it is to land working at a restaurant or retail store.If I could give you my \"best recipe for life\" suggestion, it would be to work in real life, and do programming as a hobby. A lot of peoples' egos go \"ewww, labor! but i want to go above and beyond\", but they end up overworking themselves and realizing that office work wasn't as great or as fun as they thought.As a hobby programmer, I've made a couple very helpful open source projects, and a lot of fun stuff involving mods for video games. I've also created a few of my own games myself, including both using game engines, and without game engines in pure programming languages.It can be a very fun creative outlet, and when you don't have time pressure behind your back, the problems you encounter can be *fun* instead of annoying; like interesting puzzles to solve.So, programming as a hobby, as long as you don't do it too much, can make for a healthy balanced life and even give you a creative outlet you didn't think of before. Programming as a *profession* you are not guaranteed to land even if you try, and even if you do land it, you might realize it isn't actually enjoyable in the long run.>ill be studying animation in polytechnic in MalaysiaI've taken some classes in animation before. I took it for fun, while most of the others in my class were taking it for career prospects. Animation is a fun hobby, especially making fun little lego animations, flipbooks, etc. But once you start getting serious with it, or taking professional courses, at least in my country, then it gets a lot harder.I've also heard from animators on the internet that their job is a struggle, that AI is concerning them about displacement, and that they're having difficulty whether they're YouTubers or employees at a company.Just google \"is animation very competitive\" and you'll find search results.",

It can be assigned or unassigned, but it's perfectly well defined - it's really just a number anyway.- Unicode in itself has no \"byte\" range. The encoding UTF-8 has variable lengths, and some of them are 4 byte long.- Unicode is much, _MUCH_ more than just the assigned characters. For each character you also must support all the properties, case foldings, categories, NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD, different collations, sortings, glyphs etc.. Range checks on the codepoints alone are almost always wrong.All of the languages with support I know of just implement the actual algorithms and then import the lists from the Unicode standard verbatim each time they do an update to not have to deal with this particular headache.Edit: In case you don't know it, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default/6163129#6163129)'s an old rant about Unicode support in Perl back in 2011 when most browsers couldn't even properly render the rant, including a lot of gotchas.",

And a block always start at a number divisible by 16, meaning that the last hex-digit is 0. So if a block doesn't have a multiple of 16 characters, there will be some empty spaces. Often there's a system within a block of some sort, so that characters either match between lower and upper case, having the same number of codes between them, or so that variations of a character have numbers close together, and if one character has 8 different variations, and another only 7, then the eightth character might be left empty (or \"reserved\" to allow for the system to make sense.I have no idea about the specific ethiopic characters, it could also be that there were some characters that weren't added, because there were \"controversies\" in how they should be interpreted, and rather than wait forever, they just added all the characters around them.Remember that unicode is a living standard, and new characters are added all the time, sometimes in existing code-blocks, sometimes entirely new blocks.It would be a terrible mess if they just started at 0x0000, and added a new character to the end of the list everytime they encountered one!",

The first, at U+1E7E7 is in keeping with the Ethiopic encoding principle in the Unicode Standard whereby eight positions are allocated per syllabic family. Most, but not all, syllabic families will have a member occupying the eighth position. Past experience found that the eight position may later be populated when a corresponding syllable is found in a language when it begins using Ethiopic script for its orthography. Accordingly, U+1E7E7 may later be populated with a HHYWA or HHYOA syllable if its availability is later found to be required by another language. The remaining unassigned positions, U+1E7EC, U+1E7EF, and U+1E7FF have correspondence with syllables still in use from the prior orthography that might have otherwise occupied these syllabic and code positions (U+1380, U+1383, and U+138F accordingly).",

This is an important rule because you don't want the code point U+0045 to mean the letter E in Unicode Version 3, but the letter W in Unicode Version 4. Code point reassignments would invalidate all earlier documents.If you accept this rule, then the following three desirable properties are incompatible:1. Related code points are grouped together in sets.2. Sets can gain characters in future versions.3. All assigned code points are contiguous beginning at 0.If you break rule 1, then you lose sets.If you break rule 2, then it means that if you need to add a related code point, you have to start a new set (which will probably have just that one code point in it). This basically makes sets pointlessSets are useful because they let you check things like \"Does this code point require a font that supports Cyrillic?\" more conveniently, as well as allowing those checks to continue working even when a new version of Unicode is released. Any new Cyrillic characters will take a previously-unassigned spot in a Cyrillic set. You need to update your code only if a new relevant set is defined, like \"Cyrillic Extended-B\".Sets are also useful for parallel development. If Team A is working on a new Cyrillic character, and Team 1 is working on a new Ethiopian character, they can each choose an unassigned code point from their respective sets and start writing documents with it to see how well it works. If you didn't have sets, then maybe Team A gets unofficial number N and Team 1 gets unofficial number N+1. But Team 1 gets their code point approved first, so now they have official number N, and this disrupts both Team A and Team 1 as they both have to go back and re-encode all their documents. (And we don't like re-encoding documents. See first paragraph.)Rule 3 isn't important. You shouldn't be rejecting unassigned code points anyway (except perhaps for those marked as \"permanently unassigned\"). The Unicode Standard has recommendations for [Unassigned Characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99191.htm), namely, to treat them as generic characters with default properties. This allows your code to continue working when previously-unassigned code points become assigned.So the question is based on a false assumption: That it's important to be able to reject unassigned code points.You don't want your program to reject a person's name because it uses a newly-assigned CJK character, or to reject a product description because it uses the newly-assigned Rupee symbol *₹*.",

Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.I would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would). In short, you generally don't use recursion unless you have a very good reason to, and you usually don't.",

Moreover, If you don't use something, you'll forget it because your brain trims it out.

You say you hit a plateau doing LeetCode questions which is definitely to be expected, learning is a bell curve and as difficulty increases the rate at which you progress decreases. This is a good sign that you're at the end of that bell curve, and that you should keep at it even if progress feels minimal.

Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition. This way, when time comes for you to perform it's automatic and requires little thought. Second, create a cheat sheet for you to easily reference hard to remember concepts. I would suggest you physically create this sheet to help solidify terms and concepts and/or but it in a spreadsheet for quick referencing. Once you feel you have a concept, command, and/or process down, remove or archive. Third, pace yourself. This is your race. Your race is different from mine and everyone else's. Comparison is a thief of joy. You should be disciplined and motivated in your race to reach your goals, but don't compare my race to yours. I may have jet boots compared to your flip flops , but I may have a lead backpack on while you're wearing a linen shirt. Finally, be honest with yourself. Our profession isn't for everyone.

Search for alumni in those titles or companies like Nvidia, Siemens, or even startups doing robotics/IoT. For prep, brush up on C++, OS concepts, and maybe RTOS. Also, when you start applying, do as much digging as possible before interviews—dig up old interview reviews, check out \"prepare.sh\" or leetcode.Full disclosure, I’m a contributor at prepare.sh now, but I used it as a regular user for my own prep long before that, and the questions were spot on for the roles I was targeting.

You need to ask yourself if what ever you do right now satisfy you or you're just keep moving with inertia from your initial childhood curiosity. And if its the latter, consider thinking about what are you really curious and passionate about. I spent 7 years studying law and 6 years working with it. It's always been easy for me, I got highest grades in school just by reading a paper 30 minutes before I needed to talk about. Never had my notes with me, it was laying clear in my head, always ready. But law is something you need to be passionate about, always digging and thinking about it, even at home. I on the other hand spent 6 years clocking out at 6pm and it left my brain until the next morning. Everyone thought I was a beast, always coming to me for the advice. I did in couple hours something that other's struggled with for several days. Everyone said I was soon to be a big deal. I was bored out of my mind. And when the opportunity presented itself, I left everything and never looked back. Because the thought about changing career was far less scary than the thought that I have to do this for the rest of my life. Now I'm getting ready for my first job in tech. People telling me I'm pretty good too. Because you can get good at anything if you put your mind to it. But this time I'm actually curious and digging. And never bored.",

I don't have a desire to learn something without a purpose. If I am not going to use it, it's likely that it won't be a good use of time as the knowledge will likely erode over time unless it's used.So I guess I would say that if you're looking to expand your knowledge, put yourself in a position where you need to learn something to do your job if that's your goal. That being said, if you're happy being very efficient at your job even if you're not growing your knowledge then that's ok too. It depends where your job is in your list of priorities. If you go this route though, you might want to occasionally, learn something new to see whether you're still capable of learning something pretty easily.",

You say you want to avoid scratch, but note that the first week of cs50 is a gentle intro via scratch. Scratch is great for beginners though if he hasn't had any experience. I've introduced a 10 year old to scratch and it's pretty phenomenal to see them get their head around basic programming concepts and talk about them without necessarily having to take on a text based syntax. It's excellent preparation for taking on that text based language because you already understand how things work conceptually, learning your first text language is just adapting the concepts you know to new syntax.",

A unique cookie (often with a GUID value) is returned to the client browser and upon subsequent web page requests the cookie is used to lookup the session information ( is the session \"current\", has the token expired or been revoked? Etc.) and the token stored with the session data is used during the web session to call APIs or connect to data stores, etc. For SPA or single page applications, a short lived sometimes single use external access token (EAT) may be issued, often derived from the login token, that allows very limited API access through a gateway that does not live on the web servers, but is accessible within the website domain. Can the login token simply be handled by the SPA ? Sure, but often an SPA is hosted within a larger site that already has dynamic content and session management. To your question, The cookie or token is returned to the calling client as the response to the authentication attempt. A server does not \"imitate\" a return message.",

It's 10 contexts either way.This does get messier with things like quic & http2 that pipeline requests within a single connection, but the mechanism that unwraps that pipeline should still split them into individual requests.The easiest way to see this is that whether by auth, cookie, header, etc, you still have to authenticate every request - every context needs to be authenticated.

This is quite easy to hit, even if you don't have many concurrent users. Fortunately, this is easy to test as well — just make a test script to write recipes to the database, and then use your website — see if there any issues when pulling out a specific recipe, or searching through recipes.The next \"10k\" limit you'll reach is 10k regular users. This is not too difficult; any scalable, modern, hosting provider — like Vercel — should be able to handle this with no issues. You'll simply want to check that you can afford whatever they are going to charge you, so this simply involves being familiar with their pricing structure.Finally, we come to what you said — \"10k concurrent users\". This is a *really* rare situation — this is going to be getting close to a really popular website on the Internet. At this point, there's no guidebook on a guaranteed, step-by-step way to handle this. You'll need to have a lot of logging in place, so that you have visibility into load times, and exactly *where* are the slowdowns. Once you know that, you can start figuring out solutions to speed up those specific slowdowns. However, it's important that you know *where* the slowdowns are first, because it's a bit waste of time to optimize something, only to find out that that wasn't the true slowdown.To test this, you can use one of the many load-testing software tools out there, once you have appropriate logging in place.",

Means to an end? In the nicest way, don’t waste your time. Programming is a lifetime of learning new things and spending hours on not only creating new things, but finding tiny bugs in thousands of lines of code. If you’re not passionate about it, you will burn out and ultimately waste your time (and sometimes money if you join a bootcamp or something). It takes a ton of failing through an attempt to create projects where you’ll actually learn and make it into a useful skill.",

Let's look at his assertions**Learn this language and you're set for life**Python is popular and it will get you far, but much like learning a second (or third language), you gain a better appreciation of the first language and its quirks when you learn a second one. Most find the second language intolerable because it does things differently from the first, especially if the language is quite a bit different. If you went from C to C++, that's like learning more C. If you go from C# to Java, they will feel like similar languages. If you go from Python to Java, Java would likely seem way to verbose and too concerned with types.It's nice to know a few other languages, but for now, getting decent at Python is a good first step.**Learn Selenium**OK, that's out of left field. If you can't build a web page, learning Selenium seems advanced. It's often used to run automated steps on a browser, often for testing purposes. It's a little like learning to fix a car before you learn how to drive. I suppose it can be done, but it seems advanced.I wouldn't worry about Selenium for now.**Taking a Course**There is a free course here: https://programming-25.mooc.fi/This is a real college course and there are some quizzes and such. You don't get credit, but at least it's structured.You could also try: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/It's a little hard to set up initially, and I think it goes into non-standard topics at the end, but it's also good. It was developed by the folks at Harvard.You'd probably spend a year (or at least 6 months) learning to program half-decently. I think some feel they need a few years to feel somewhat comfortable. It does vary widely from person to person as some people find it easy to pick up (rare) or they just don't get it at all (rare). You seem like you're in the middle.Stuff to learn* Control flow (if, while, function calls)* File I/O* Functions* ClassesPython doesn't really force you to write your own functions or even classes, but it's good to learn them.Afterwards, you'd learn some basic data structures* Queues, stacks* Trees* Dictionaries* Graphs* Sorting algorithms* Binary search through a sorted arrayAs another person suggested Automate the Boring Stuff (free online) spends ten chapters going over Python, then has ten more chapters (or so), each devoted to one thing you could automate.

A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the \"hole\" inside the loop. There's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)For the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.A bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.Once you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.P.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [\"skeleton\"](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that. But getting something that works reliably and gives good-quality results would likely be a very challenging project, IMO. Certainly much more difficult and time-consuming than just redrawing the letters by hand.",

You'd then animate the percentage from 0->100%.You didn't mention what platform you're on, but on web Snap.svg has the `getSubpath()` method which can perform that operation, and on native, Skia has the `SkTrimPathEffect` API that can do the same. There are likely other libraries out there that have an implementation of a similar API.If you're interested in how this works, typically the input Bezier spline is chopped up into a bunch of tiny linear segments, which have very simple closed-form length and interpolation computations. To get the overall length of the spline, sum the length of the tiny linear segments. To get a % length of the spline, grab all the tiny linear segments up to that % of length.",

I might also try asking ChatGPT for hints on how to get started. If I could find some tutorial projects I'd try them just to learn more, then I'd dive in. But there's no magic point where all the tutorials just click and you just know what to do. It's all trial and error.

That's why courses like Odin Project are crucial, it should be one of the first things they teach you.There is the front end code - the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that gets sent to and parsed by the user's web browser.Then there's the back end code - the Python, C#, PHP, or whatever language you like running on a web server, that takes a browser's HTTP request, does stuff, then sends a response back to the browser (usually in the form of a web page or some dynamic data to render).You can't run Python code directly in a web browser, they don't understand it.GitHub Pages is designed for hosting documentation for your GitHub projects, as such it has limited capabilities. There is obviously a web server involved, but it only serves front end code (aka static content), it can't run custom Python code or a database or anything like that.Instead what you need is a web server that supports Python code. Probably using a Python-based web framework like Django. Or at least something that can run Python via CGI, a protocol that allows standard web servers like Apache or Nginx to call external runtimes. Very few companies are giving this kind of functionality away for free, it costs real money to maintain the infrastructure. You can run a web server from your own machine, but that has its own caveats.",

Sure the capabilities you have will land you the job. But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you. Don’t limit yourself to one stack though. Try to learn the basics for a few others so you know what you like best. For example Angular, Vue, etc.(My bias is for react and next.js though :squinting_face_with_tongue:)",

Even a big successful private company either won't offer you any stock or the stock will be worthless without some kind of exit event that lets you cash out your options.Even for big public companies outside of FAANG, you're not likely to get much stock:[https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-eng](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-eng)Capital One: $150k for mid level[https://www.levels.fyi/companies/walmart/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l2](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/walmart/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l2)Walmart: $112k for L2One of those is going to be closer to the average salary for a developer with 2 years of experience in the US. Out of the millions of developers in the US, most of them do not work for FAANGs.Landing a job at a FAANG has always been very competitive and requires specific interviewing skills, in this market it is even more competitive. About 40k software engineers work at Meta across all levels and the company makes about $150 billion a year in revenue, so they can afford to pay their developers a lot.",

And then you’re looking at candidates working at some of the most profitable companies in the world. To get into these companies they’re doing 5-6 rounds of intense interviewing. To even get their resume looked at they are competing with thousands of other candidates many of whom are also from other FAANGS and top tier colleges.In America we can be fired for no reason at all without warning, so our salaries have to compensate for our potentially long and unexpected job searches. South America appears to have considerably more protections here.You also likely have public healthcare, low cost education, and/or pension plans, none of which we have (we have social security but it’s only for folks who worked and every election there’s talk of getting rid of it). So our salaries have to offset that and other basic social services that we lack. The market is horrible right now. Getting interviewed at one of these jobs without connections or a top tier degree is basically impossible. Partially because there are not nearly as many openings now as there used to be, partially because these jobs have always been somewhat like that. Even if you got the interview you’d need near perfect performance to pass as employment shortages mean they can be pickier. And after all of that most of the FAANG companies will be looking to heavily overwork you and then push you out or PIP you within under 3 years. I worked at Amazon, happens all the time.",

        "body": "I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation. I am not anti capitalist. I believe in markets. But capitalism only works when it is balanced. Capital should flow to where it creates value. When one player has too much it is like poker. They just buy every pot.",

AI: You are absolutely right, putting your dick inside a mixer will not work. The reason why is because bacteria are very small for it to have any effect. Instead what you have to do is to set your dick on fire, that will killl all the germs, first of all, get a gallon of gasoline... Me: Wait, but what if I just wash it with water, could that also work? AI: You have nailed it! Now you are getting into the intrincacies of dick cleanlines. In order to get your dick clean you need to get some water. The first step is to go to the nearest river and get your dick out Me: What about using the faucet's water? AI: You are absolutely right again! The faucet's water is all you need for dick cleaning purposes. On and on for 7 hours.

I can confidently say that I know when you're cheating. Software Engineers are not Actors, and they ALWAYS make stupid mistakes in how they answer a question when they have the answer as opposed to when they're working it out. In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.You would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires. I've even interviewed people that have so blatantly cheated that they've either quit an interview mid-way despite getting the answer \"right\", because they couldn't explain an if statement or why they've structured a for loop in a specific way (it's a for-each).",

This means they have no memory of past bust cycles, and they're experiencing one for the first time now. Because they assumed the party would never end, they were extremely shocked in 2022 when the market suddenly reversed course and layoffs began.As for the people saying \"but this time is different because AI\", it's important to remember that \"this time is different\" every time. In the mid-2000s, people had a panic over offshoring destroying the American tech industry, a fear that clearly never materialized.

It honestly doesn't make much sense looking at the state of the tech market in general, there are other things in play - outsourcing, fictitious hype gravy trains, etc. Where every company was and should still be upkeeping their legacy systems, adding AI functionality, and the startup scene should be kicking full tilt (now more than ever). But it's not. The upper execs and boards are still increasing their take home and ownership at or above the same rate. It's really a tear in the system. Something is very wrong - and no I don't believe it was due to 'over hiring' during covid. It's probably more-so that they have been sitting and have so much pride in their infrastructure/office-space, their ping pong tables, etc. where those buildings were a massive shit investment (hence enforced RTO), where they were absolutely hemorrhaging money for years. They own other office spaces they were renting out to smaller companies - which if you drive around and peek at those alt-office spaces, they're still dormant.

This article is flawed, because contributions are more complicated than just commits, but it is true that something like [10% of developers contribute nothing](https://shiftmag.dev/ghost-engineers-stanford-study-4643/) (hint: they're on reddit instead, posting comments about how to get a job in the industry).As with all subreddits, this sub is a huge echo chamber, with people voting what they want to hear to the top. There are even periodic calls to ban or flair or otherwise discredit new grads or junior developers for being too pessimistic due to \"not having enough experience\", even though they are, by far, the largest part of the industry and the greatest indicator of it's health.Even today, anyone who dares complain about the state of the industry is often derided for being mediocre, told that \"there are no problem for goOd dEvelOpErs\" and fed other pointless misinformation. Most developers are somewhere around average. This average has risen a lot over the past ten years. If these people can't find jobs, the industry has a problem. It's really that simple. Tech isn't going to die as an industry, but macroeconomic trends mean that it's only going to become more competitive for developers.",

For example, for one role, it was supposed to be about modernizing COBOL code to Java, but I was interviewing for just the Java part. The recruiter said I wouldn’t have to worry about COBOL. Then I got into the interview and the hiring manager asked how I would interpret COBOL code if I needed to on the job. He also gave me a mini-system design exercise and asked if I would use a noSQL or SQL DB. But then he wanted me to drill down and give sample SQL queries. I don’t have any experience writing queries so I couldn’t answer that.I had another interview with a bank where the recruiter said it would be a call with the manager, and “maybe an engineer” would join, and it ended up being 2 engineers joining and doing a panel-style interview, which didn’t go well. Most recently, I had another interview interview for a test automation role, and I tried to ask the recruiter for more info about what the team did but she didn’t have any. I thought the role had to do with the tests that run in the CI/CD pipeline but it was a completely different world, I didn’t recognize any of the testing technologies the manager mentioned (because I never worked in testing) and it was awkward when he asked why I wanted to join that team when he hadn’t told me what the team did and neither did the recruiter.",

You network so over time, your \"brand\" (you, your work, etc) increases in value.Then later, when a company wants to fill a role, employees with connections will typically refer people from those connections first. This gives those candidates a significant advantage in the market.Networking also builds a repertoire of trust.It's much much easier to land remote jobs with a good network, since the gained trust can be converted in to more flexible working conditions (since companies will have an easier time trusting you to get your work done).",

Meanwhile if you stay at Google and get promo, your base salary is adjusted to bottom of L+1 band and you are granted NO new equity for promo. Your annual refresher is just at the L+1 band, so it can take a few years to reach middle of the total comp band.You could also clear the interview bar for L+1, be unprepared for it, and get managed out. Being close to promo at your current company usually means you are operating at L+1 though, which is why I think that’s ideal. I would only stay at Google if you see guaranteed promo toward L4 in next cycle, scope after that for L5, and strong support from your manager to get you on those projects. But without foresight it’s hard to beat a guaranteed level bump and band reset from a financial perspective imo w/ all other factors normalized.",

It's almost always about their prosperity relative to their expectations.Once you understand this, the world makes a lot more sense in a lot of ways.CS grads aren't the most vocally frustrated because they have the worst career outcomes, they are the most frustrated because their career outcomes are the farthest from their expectations.When they chose their major, people were vloging their life as a faang engineer making $300k working 15 hrs/week, and everyone told them it was the most in demand field with the easiest labor market. A sure bet, just do the work to get through the degree, and then it's smooth sailing to FIRE at 30.Accountants weren't given that story. They chose a practical career with expectations about where they ended up.",

Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.You’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.You’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.Sounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.It’s far worse.",

There can be gaps/flaws in requirements/design, but it doesn't always become apparent until the thing has been built, people see it for real, and you're working with real data scenarios. Better places/teams take care of these things ahead of time, but mistakes happen, things get overlooked. At worse places, they make the devs figure these things out on their own.So, a lot of responsibility ultimately lands on the devs.Another thing is that industry/type of work likely attracts certain personality types. There may be more people who would rather work in isolation, so working with others causes them more stress. They may not be able to handle situations, including stress, tight deadlines, production issues.A final thing that pops into my head is that money always attracts people. I read Fishbowl, which is a social media app/site that was originally for consultants. It's tried to spread out a bit. But you know all those psychotic people in management consulting and strategy? One of their exit strategies are tech companies because they want to make money, too. So, the money in tech attracts more psychopaths who are more than willing to sacrifice the mental health and careers of others for their own well-being and bonuses.",

They have people working with them that they get a cut off the work from those people. They all work overtime (50+ hrs), usually in unpleasant weather, because most customers procrastinate on repairs until it starts to hurt them. This pay level usually happens decade(s) into their careers when they know basically everything they need to and have connections with wholesalers and inspectors.This is all contingent on there actually being work in their area, which is not a given. SWEs can break 200k a few years into their career by taking 2 shitty contract jobs that pay $50/hr and being willing to work a few extra hours to do both.

Do they have a boss that they all report to? Someone responsible for the whole group?I collect all of the examples of their garbage code and my peer reviews, then I send them to him. At first I was being kind and tolerant, but these people are making mistakes that literally no one with actual development skill should make.I've had many of them replaced already, and 90% of them are the same. I ended up with two decent contractors which try to keep the others in line.Their boss has actually made attempts to hold them accountable, and things have slowly improved.Anyway, yes, try to push for better code if possible. It is _painful_ to continue working with code that bad. Since your lead will likely support you in your effort, it might be worth it.",

Just because it isn’t SWE doesn’t mean you need to work in fast food for the rest of your life. You have a college degree, and a very rigorous one at that. Many jobs do not require a specialized degree, just the fact that you have one gives you an advantage. Once you start your career, you’ll start building your network for real. You could meet the right person at the right time and have a foot in the door into a SWE role down the line.Besides, there’s no rule saying that you must work a fast food job until you land that dream job. You can start in something else and continue applying for SWE roles. Maybe you’ll end up doing something else you like more, shit i see SWEs on reddit all the time talking about how much they want to pivot to something else.In any case, this is the unfortunate reality for many, many recent grads; and for many more to come. A lot of CS grads with dreams of being a software engineer will ultimately do something else because they have to, until the market improves.",

The remote work aspect can amplify these feelings since you're hyper-aware of your productivity throughout the day.The standup charade is unsustainable and probably contributing to your stress. Consider proactively approaching your manager about taking on additional responsibilities, proposing process improvements, or contributing to other teams' projects. Frame it as professional growth rather than admitting you're underutilized.Start exploring other opportunities before this situation damages your skills or motivation further. You can use a service like Applyre to passively search while still employed. Look specifically for roles with clear project pipelines and established team structuresRemember that not all tech jobs suffer from this problem. Your fear of repetition is understandable, but asking detailed questions about day-to-day responsibilities and team dynamics during interviews can help you avoid similar situations.",

I would also say if anyone needs help I have some capacity, sometimes that led to more work but sometimes I was just given then good optics of Im getting my work done + remaining available for more work.I think I got away with this bc I was a junior. I could see this working again as a senior doing more deep dive or complex tasks that no one can rly question, but as an aspiring mid level I think I'm just gonna have to get stuff done, maybe delay it by a day or two and be transparent im testing my ticket.I got average/good reviews most of the time. I got a bad performance review twice in a row, that taking it easy caught up during crunch time.I stepped it up and cleared my name, just didn't matter bc we got mass laid off anyway lol. I consider myself successful, because the same boss that gave me the bad review got laid off with me - and ultimately gave me referrals + was a strong testimony to help me get my new job.I would use that free time to up skill now though. I would study whatever it takes to be successful for interviews in devops, or even just see if you have interest in learning any kind of tech in a deeper setting like reading books/documents or building out small little projects (way easier to do that now with AI as a starting point). Otherwise go the company route and start looking around with coworkers, your manager, or even some sister teams and explore what work is out there.

SO. HARD. :(idk if i have much to offer in terms of advice, but maybe knowing you're not alone will make you feel better! the industry feels brutal right now (like it's not made for us anymore) and I just don't want to be a part of it. I know it feels like throwing away everything my life(career) has been building up towards, but it's also kinda freeing. I do feel that the ways we think / approach problems is unique to our practice, and can be helpful in many other practices. IMO do a solid quiet-quit and try your best to work on things on the side to see what sticks for you. It's a luxury to be able to pivot while still getting an income! sorry if Im just ranting and didn't offer any meaningful advice; just felt the need to share bc I'm going through similar stuff! Good Luck!",

There will be winners, losers, and companies that were just along for the ride during AI. Have you been looking at switching companies rather than switching fields? Not every company has the same view of AI as your current company. You're probably suffering from burnout, from the mix of surviving three rounds of layoffs and how unpleasant your current working environment has become. Out of curiosity, how much have you been thinking about this switch? Part of why I mention this is that other fields aren't necessarily better. Nursing comes up often in this sub, but if you ever look at the nursing sub, they are pretty miserable there. They are understaffed, and we're just 5 years off from a pandemic where lots of nurses were dying.I saw a video recently that said Private Equity firms were buying out plumbers in cities. Once they've bought out enough, they will drop their rates to put the others out of business. Then, they'll drive rates up. There are a lot of fields going through change right now. I'm personally in the camp that AI will be another tool we use, and there will be blowback when the bubble eventually bursts. It's just not sustainable, and eventually, there will be callout for actual results. Then all that money being invested will have to be invested elsewhere.",

I got hired at age 40 for my first job with no CS degree at the time(I've since completed it) and no experience in the industry. But one thing I did have was that I was far better than most junior devs coming out of college, because I put the work in for several years prior. Now you don't need to take several years to transition. In my case, I always assumed wrongly that those people with CS degrees were better than I was, but as I continued to become better and better and take code challenges and pass with \"professional level\" code grades, I started to believe that I was good enough and started applying to jobs. It took me a few interviews to land my first job but it's been like a rocket ship going straight up in my career ever since.",

It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward \"coffee chat\" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.That feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to \"network\" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The \"friends\" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",

As a more junior dev I went to a junior dev meetup. Met some people who were trying to get their first job. Really got along and they seemed switched on. My company wasn’t hiring at that point but I messaged my boss that there were some switches on developers looking for entry level roles. We were able to make a role which one of them got. The hidden job market is a thing. These jobseekers didn’t think they would get a job from me, they weren’t trying to use me. But it worked out! “It isn’t what you know but who you know”, and if you know more people you up your chances for opportunities. We are more likely to recommend people we know and trust. We are more likely to listen to the recommendations of people we know and trust. But it is a long game. Can be years to see the benefits.",

Do good work and get on well with people in the office(also: work *in* an office) and don't be afraid to cultivate genuine friendships. Go to happy hours that the other underlings are organizing, those are the ones where you'll build real rapport with your team, rather than the official ones put on by upper management that doesn't even know your name. Go out to lunch regularly. Basically if you can do good work and be a likeable member of the team you'll begin to leave a good impression on people and over time you'll find yourself with a professional network.

I bright this up with my manager and got the ole “it’ll be a good thing to bring up during the next promotion cycle” seven months from now.Some new “can’t miss” deadline nearly every week “, weekend releases, insane pressure. Team clearly burnt out and getting short with each other, it’s just sad.I’ve been lucky enough to get many interviews and it’s brutal. 6-7 rounds per company, really positive feedback, just to get to the end and be told they ended up hiring someone else with years more experience. If people with 10 YOE are having to down level to take SE2 and SE3 roles (I don’t blame that at all) I’m not really sure what to do at that point. Work will always be work to me in some ways, but I did genuinely enjoy my job and showed up with positivity every day. At this point I’m fully burnt out and looking for any exit I can",

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.It's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.That part's out of our control.What's in our control is how we react to it.WLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a \"OK, will take a look tomorrow morning\".There's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies \"tighten the belt\" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane. In the medium/long term find another job ASAP. It's a sinking ship culture-wise.",

It’s often the point where shifting from “just executing” to “strategically shaping” your role becomes critical.Burnout like this can actually be a signal where it usually means it’s time to grow differently, not necessarily grind harder.This shift in mindset helped me make more impact, focus on the right skills (soft-skills that can be a game changer), and get recognized + promoted.Feel free to reach out if you have questions. happy to help however I can!",

The coding part is still fine and I enjoy it, but everything else - the 5-6 round interview processes, the leetcode grind, the daily standups, scrum meetings, product meetings, performance reviews, and my favourite one that ruins everything good that remains - the internal politics.When I started in 2010 I sent my CV to a company, I had one round of interview and a one page test, it was one day, I got hired. Now a round with a recruiter, then one with the hiring manager, a homework assignment, a leetcode technical round, a culture fit round, and if you did not fail at any of these steps, you can still be rejected because there was someone better. And this is for one company, and you rarely got hired from one application, you need to go through 5-10 if you are lucky. And do this beside a 9-5 job. It is ridiculous, even doctors and surgeons do not have such hiring processes.Life should be much more about than this soul destroying industry, and to be honest I don’t care about money, reputation and fancy titles anymore, it’s not worth it, everyone has one life.",

On the down side, he has to worry about paying farm labourers and making sure the ends meet and he's pretty much spent what he sold the house in England for. They're in it now, they have to make it work. On the plus side, apart from a few initial bad starts which cost them a good few quid, the last time he came back to visit in the UK, he had a brand new Toyota. OK it's not an Audi or a BMW, but a brand new Toyota in Ireland is roughly equivalent. Especially a diesel with a Dublin plate! Seriously, in Ireland, that's doing pretty well!\\- Another bought a van, a bunch of cleaning equipment and became a carpet cleaner. On the plus side, the amount of hotels and function rooms that immediately gave him business and even rolling appointments is definitely helping to pay off the equipment he bought through hire purchase. On the downside, he's cleaning carpets at 55 years old with a 55 year old back. He likes the work but it's obviously a lot more physical than he really thought.\\- The last one now works three days a week doing minor admin stuff for an office. Filing, sending stuff out, packaging, doing the odd excel sheet stuff, fixing printers, any odd jobs. It doesn't pay well. But the mortgage was paid a while ago, no real debts, kids are off to university, his wages pay for the monthly bills easily, the wife's wages pay for the family holiday every year though kids may or may not come. If you have no heavy outgoings, you sort of don't need to chase the wage anymore. So yeah, none of that is helpful or answers your question. Or does it?",

Also in your practice you need to sort of streamline the thought process along with the toolset.Think of it like branch prediction in computers. The computer just guesses what it's going to need to do next and it starts prefetching data and executing instructions. It might guess wrong sometimes and do some wasted work, but overall things happen way faster than if the cpu was just waiting around.Another analogy is like competitive games/sports. The way you get good at these things is by internalizing the playbook so that you can make snap decisions in the moment based on the scenario. Obviously you get there by lots of focused applied practice. LC is pretty similar. When you first start it's normal to sit around brainstorming and headscratching a problem and that's fine but realistically that's just not a viable approach in an interview, so you have to internalize the playbook.",

You can often get in just on portfolio work and being able to speak to your development abilities.These jobs won't be at FAANG companies, but they are not terrifically hard to find. Look for small to midsized companies, especially ones that are not directly in the tech or SaaS world. Agency work is also a good option as they generally hire on potential more than raw ability.That being said, you ***can*** just grind leetcode for a few months and get better at it, do a few hundred problems, figure out the patterns, watch some tutorials, etc. Leetcode's unfortunately not really a transferable skill to day-to-day dev work in my experience, they're not significantly different from the \"brain teaser\" type problems companies used to use before. If you know the answer, they're easy, if you don't... a lot of them (medium+) are based on academic thesis work, so you're probably not figuring it out under time pressure in an interview.",

A contract role as a consultant may be easier to land in this environment, and can help you build exactly that kind of experience.At the same time, starting a side project or business, something where you have to identify a customer need, build software for it, and try to monetize, can help you develop the kind of product thinking and entrepreneurial mindset that employers and clients increasingly value.",

There's of course some situations where the crisis is so big and the time line so short (and August is short if there's nothing, but an expectation of something that a team spent 18 months on). In such an unusual situation, unusual measures could be needed and depending on other circumstances it could be the right choice for a lead to take a heavy-handed approach. Even if it involves compromises. BUT I would expect in such a situation is that he would spin off tasks to the team, and you. E.g. he could ask you to review things, create tests (unit and others), design/impl of additional feature/functionality, ci/cd, documentation based on his notes - he should be able to quite quickly write down at east the key design decisions and premises etc. as he goes along. This should be able to speed up the delivery. It would only cost him maybe 10-15% of the time but still deliver a bigger boost than this, even if the rest are juniors. Maybe you can suggest this to him, e.g. offer to help in the way that stands least in the way.",

I have years of experience, and I’ve had conversations with someone who was working at Hobby Lobby a few months before. Don’t let someone lacking emotional intelligence get you down. I had a recruiter start harassing me on LinkedIn because I was being considered for a contract-to-hire role at Chase that was a higher rate than she was used to seeing. She kept trying to insist I was lying. I just blocked her. No good advice on how to network. You need to find people willing to talk to someone, effectively a stranger, for very little in return. It’s a challenge. I recently accepted some LinkedIn invites from random new grads from my college, but I had too many personal things come up to follow up with them. It’s a very hard market right now. You know that. It just takes more time and effort than normally. One thing I’d encourage you to do more of is learning and expanding your skillset. You say it’s been 7 months. You can learn quite a bit in time like that. Maybe you should try learning some things to make yourself a stronger candidate. AWS had a free tier. You could get exposure to cloud services that will help you grow. I encounter a lot of experienced people who still don’t have a lot of cloud experience.",

Because they were small they didn’t have specific recruiters, it was the head of development usually interviewing me. I did have a personal project I had been working on and was excited about it. It wasn’t a standard tutorial or project that everyone had done. I like to think it was that my excitement about my project shined through, because at several places I pulled out my laptop to show the project, and each time it usually ended up with me doing 15 minutes of pair programming with them. A side note: learning pair programming skills is super useful! Not just professionally useful, but great for interviews. Talking through what you are doing as you do it. AMA!",

It is sometimes hard to do as a researcher since your incentives are misaligned - publishing frequently is often incompatible with writing clean, maintainable code. But trust me it will help in your own research, especially if you standardize your setup to launch, track, and report experiments in the first 1-2 years of your PhD.

If you are doing it cause you heard you can make a ton of money or its an easy gig you can skate by in because you watched some dork's day in the life of a SWE where they worked 45 minutes out of an 8 hour day, I'd look for something else.Don't buy into the AI hype train. AI has a lot of flaws but if used properly, its a tool to augment a developer...not replace. People hyping AI like its going to replace people either have a vested interest in seeing AI succeed (and we are using AI loosely here, they are hyping up LLLMs), parroting the hot takes they see online for engagement, or haven't really ever coded anything beyond a basic todo list app.Also, my advice is to not utilize AI while you learn. Just like lifting weights, your brain is a muscle and if you never learn how to learn, and AI can't figure out the problem, your going to be SOL. Utilize your time in college to learn how to figure things out and think critically, don't let AI do that for you. I tutored online for 3 years and the number of students that utilized AI for their learning but had no clue what was going on was huge, they are likely now running into issues finding work because if they manage to land an interview, they certainly aren't passing them.My view, there is going to be a lot of work in 5-10 years fixing applications built utilizing AI because everyones mandating it be used in the work place to make devs more effective. Theres already been studies where usage of AI has been a net negative in productivity. Personal annecdoate, worked on an application where a guy vibe coded an integration into sales force in c#, in order to find a patients next appt date, it had to look back through all 35 years of patient data (all patients) in order to find one patients future appt date. Took 10 minutes to run 150 patients worth of data because it was churning millions of row for each patient because chat gpt coded the query.",

Just go to an interview where no one goes and you have a job. The trick is simple, be willing to do what others hate. SAP consultant, legacy technologies like Delphi, enterprise low-code and so on. In my country even no one wants to do Ruby, it is dying anyways. They want all the cool stuff like React, bah. Everyone wants to do React, you compete against tens of thousands of ppl. If in my country you go to an interview for Ruby, your competition will be 5 people max.",

It was more or less a dead-end job since there wasn't a lot of room for advancement/salary increase. Mentorship was non-existent as was training and pretty much everything else. Things were siloed and if you did what you were told you would get the job. I'm thankful I had the job because at least it was a foot in the door into IT. The second job I'm at is better in some ways and worse in others. We're very understaffed and are on a hiring freeze with a lot of technical debt that is overdue by years. Like a lot of organizations we want to be proactive by reacting to the latest trends in IT-- if you guessed AI, you'd be correct. We have a Github that's there more or less for some kind of version control, but it's used kind of rarely. Yes, the technical debt is to that degree. However, I'm lucky to have someone that's at least willing to work with me, and help me out and provides me some advice of things I should be doing-- that's when I buy a book on that topic and read it. I try to do a book a month when I have the time. My advice would be to do that, talk with someone you trust or who is willing to help a little and research on your own. People will take notice and be happy you cared. If there's other IT departments you work with, I'd also ask some questions what they do, their responsibilities and at least understand them from a cursory glance so if you know of something is their responsibility you can articulate yourself in a manner where people will at least see you're taking yourself seriously as a professional.",

If a chance presents itself, mention that you're looking for a role in $tech_stack.Your networking will have a greater effect if you attend a recruiting-focused meetup. For example, HackerX hosts events in multiple cities and they match you up with different companies for 5-minute speed-dating-style chats with a chance to mingle over pizza or drinks afterwards. They sell tickets but give me a free pass every time. I don't know if anyone has to pay or if it's just to make it seem exclusive.

Yes, offers can get revoked through no fault of your own.What I do is pass the background check, sign the forms, get a firm start date and only then give notice of leaving. Is usually 2-3 weeks, was 1 week once due to background check delay. I got blackballed, oh well. You want to give 2 days notice out of paranoia, you sure can.Negotiation, some companies refuse. Others, you need leverage in the form of another job offer, which they can match or give you a signing bonus instead or maybe 1 extra week of vacation. They just aren't going to give you more for the sake of it. That looks bad. Your pay was set from experience, job title, work unit and pay bands. No one rolled a d20.Other thing in negotiation, standard time to accept or refuse the offer is 1 or 2 weeks. I've asked for and received an extra week when given 1 week and explained I wanted to be fair and finish the rest of my scheduled interview with other companies. I've also asked after a final interview if I could get a verbal decision in less than a week.",

I'll have a lot to talk about if someone asks about them, but it has done nothing to catch any attention, even on entry level listings.For those that are curious so they can judge for themselves; the first project is a WebSocket based chat server written in Go. It has message caching with Redis(Valkey), long term message storage via PostgreSQL, and an admin panel via React where admins can create chat channels, ban users, and search message history. The server was containerized with Docker compose and used Caddy as a reverse proxy with TLS. I did a basic chat client in Qt/QML and C++.The second project was a basic audio DAW/tracker where you could cache audio samples, sequence patterns, and play them back. It was in C++ and Qt/QML with RtAudio to create the audio stream. I had to explore multi-threading and lock-free design for this project and genuinely learned a lot. I even separated the gui from the audio engine and made my engine a static library, in case I wanted to switch away from Qt in the future.I know it's not a replacement for job experience, but they did nothing for me. I figured going off the beaten path would benefit me, but no pay off yet.",

Are you in NH because it’s close to home and family ? Yes google overlooks the coop at MIT but loads of other people work there and the myriad of firms that are in Boston and the surrounding cities. Also loads of Keene alumni in the area as well so don’t dismiss it as the price for 4 years tuition is lower than one year at some private colleges at the same academic regard and level. Contact them directly and ask them for advice. If you don’t have drive or ambition going to a top tier school won’t get you hired for long. My suggestion is that you figure out an area of focus that’s likely close to the tech stack you’re doing for work as a test engineer ( if possible but if it’s cobol or some old spaghetti just take the mulligan )and then use that to jump into a dev role.",

Nice to have a cushion of adequately long stays so getting dicked over once doesn't flag you as a hopper.Be appreciative you have a job and learn all the tech stack and software you can and use it while you're there.

The majority of recruiters can't tell \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" from \"on the Rust board of directors\" just by looking at a project listed on a resume or discussing it in a screening call. Know your audience; An engineering manager, or senior/staff+ engineer reviewing your resume or interviewing you, will probably know the difference. Recruiters speak \"years of experience\" and \"accredited education\" exclusively.I'll add that the project is 100% useless in any case if you can't speak competently, verbally, to the design and implementation. Why this, why that, what if ... I and my engineers are asking a lot of questions that start this way.Personally I care about impact/value and demonstrated ability to work on a team. Show me those 2 things and the focus of the interview will shift to your project/product. We hired the guy with no degree who built a Roblox game with 4 other people that peaked at ~1000 concurrent players. Was it technically impressive? Not particularly -- their contributions are what I would expect of any fresh undergrad. Are there Roblox games with higher concurrent player counts? Probably I don't play. Did the person experience some concrete, real world struggles with shipping a software product? Absolutely yes. Did we talk about those experiences at length? Absolutely yes.",

I'm just going to dump my thoughts on the interview process and how far I have to go still.I refused to accept I'm not good enough for this industry despite failing so much. It took me 1k+ applications, 20+ different position interviews, to get 1 decent offer (that is still a pretty big downgrade to my last 2 jobs).I have anxiety and have a low stress tolerance, so I was fighting twice as hard because I couldn't make myself study more than 1-2 hours a day + I would get super nervous during interviews and it made it very hard to recall what I studied for.Maybe it was because I took it easy for most of my work life, maybe I just was supposed to be interview prepping during down time. For whatever reason, I could not adapt to what it took to pass interviews.The random trivia questions just get me. I don't have memorized small little stuff like making random SQL queries verbally or specific syntax or concepts for coding languages. I've gotten better at it studying and getting live interviews for months - even then I'm still missing questions sometimes. I HATED that feeling of completely blanking out on something that sounds easy, but the pressure and the fact I just Google this stuff when I need it at work made it so hard for me.Part of it was me stretching the truth in my resume, but early on they wanted me to be able to talk more deeply about CI/CD, and cloud/devops + QA experience. I just didn't know that stuff and lost a lot of early interviews bc of that. After I studied some major concepts and talking points - it was good enough for most interviews but some people would DIG in and expose me.I'd get a small coding live assignment that would be similar to a homework you'd get in first/second year college - but you have 10-15 minutes to do it. I immensely struggled with the pressure even if it was \"easy\".  I started timing myself doing LC easies and pretend to try to simulate that pressure.I'd get Leetcode, the worst I saw was Mediums in interviews. I wasn't that good at it, but at least that one is straight forward on how to improve even if it's many hours and hard.I got a take home once + did one personal project, and used AI to make it. I then went back and revised it after it was working to make it feel more like \"my code\", and then studied the code base with AI until I could defend the entire codebase. I did end up passing that specific interview. I will admit, making a personal project in my stack did help a little when I was discussing trivia questions and concepts bc it was more fresh.I got system design in 2 dif interviews, failed them both. Maybe the landscape is changing with AI but I felt like system design for 3 YOE was very unfair. I did not study this stuff, I'll work on it studying on the job in addition to this other shit above.I think I got a lot better at behaviorals, but I don't think I had the best stories about what I accomplished at work at first. I will literally be on the lookout to hunt for good project stories at my next job, whether it's work I did or it's my coworkers. As long as you can reasonably explain the STAR and talk at a high level about the coding and the decision making and paint a good story - I think you can get away with it even if you are borrowing someone else's stories.",

I would suggest CS if you plan to stick to IT as you get to learn networking, algos, AI etc. which is applicable in industry.Take CS, do a focus in AI/Net/Sec/Algos/Data sci... or something like that, you can also have a minor in math. Just keep an eye out for requirements as some courses can be offered once a year making some concentrations/minors just unachievable in a reasonable time frame.Consider doing summer classes that could help speed up process too.

OMSCS at Georgia Tech will accept liberal arts majors though and is all online. No funding but it's inexpensive by US standards. It's a rigorous program and will fail people out.You get the same job with a BS in CS as you do an MS. Maybe 10% of jobs list an MS as a plus. But yeah you'd have to go MS in CS with a Math degree. Get more in debt for choosing the wrong degree at the start.Problem with all CS is how overcrowded it is. Not enough jobs for everyone. Check this sub out. Some people make it, some don't. It's a risk.>I've studied the equivalent of the second year of a CS program on my own.No you haven't. A legit CS program is 30 hours of graded assignments per week, timed exams, testing of theoretical knowledge and practical skill, plus weed out calculus/chemistry/physics failing the bottom 1/4.

If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that. So if you want to learn mathematics in some sense to widen your perspective, a well thought out CS course load and maybe some reading on the weekend can definitely do that. CS isn't really that far mathematics if you look at it the right way.",

If you're solely relying on AI or someone else to find out the answers to things, when it comes to getting/keeping a job, how much more useful are you going to be than AI or someone offshore that companies may try to replace you with? I'm not saying you should never use AI or ask other people for help, but I think you should also consider what other ways you might be able to go through to find the answers to some of these things. In particular, if your question is whether or not a piece of code works, there should be a way to test that out without AI or asking someone else.",

My main interests also involves scale and I'm interested in getting to work with companies that deal with high throughput or distributed systems. I graduated from a 3-4th tier uni in 2023 and only work at a Fortune 500 company in enterprise right now. I'm in the process of job searching and hope to land a job at big tech or adjacent within 6 months (fingers crossed) so I can work on more interesting problems and to relocate.I also have already applied to OMSCS and am awaiting decision for Spring 2026, but due to the aforementioned goals, I'm planning to defer my start date for a year to get a chance to job hop as well as to sit on the thought for a bit. I imagine you're also wishing to do the computing systems specialization as well? My main concerns with a masters also align with yours too - between the gym, hobbies, my gf - and the idea that I can simply redirect the time commitment to get hands on experience with my interests at work anyways.I've emailed a Meta Staff engineer who also had a masters and he mostly concluded with the popular opinion that it wasn't much useful outside of having a good time. I think for my case I can see that it can be a backup option for me in terms of better job security given a pessimistic market: for you, I feel that landing in Meta out of college is all the opportunity that you need :) If I was in your spot I think I'd forgo the masters and focus on the other important things in life, we spend too much time inside anyways. At the end of the day do you think you'll gain fulfillment out of it? If you're already at Meta the ROI probably isn't that high",

Be prepared to walk through any projects you've built, explaining your decision-making process and what you learned from challenges you faced. They know you're new to this field, so they're looking for someone who can learn quickly and contribute to their team culture.

The bootcamp/self-taught path (even if it's associate degree) rarely works anymore unless you're exceptional.It's almost impossible without a CS or Computer Engineering degree. Every entry level job gets over 100 applications so HR filters by degree for a sanity check. I like your plan.>as eventually staff/principal SWEI don't think that's what most people really want. At Team Lead, I was working 50 hours per week with 15-20 hours of meetings. I had responsibility to my team and the whole business unit such as tracking work intake and discussing if defects could impact other departments. For 10% more pay. Then it's a pyramid, rank in Top 10% of employees at your grade for a chance of making Principal. You made it that far? Now get 5 DMs per day of people asking you for help who will blame you if you don't. Be married to the job.>That said, I enjoy the field (I genuinely like math, I like coding (just not obsessed)) Me too. Coding isn't my hobby. I like it but it's just a job. I'd rather do most anything else in my free time. I don't know an accountant who does accounting for fun when they go home. I stepped up my math and statistics knowledge. I get more out of that.",
