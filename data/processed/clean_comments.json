Data scientists usually need to spend more time conceptualizing the model and figure out what the problem is, what the model should do, how to engineer the data to accurately represent the business scenario, what are the biases in it, what are the limitations of the model, etc. These challenges take enough of their time and mental capacity that considering anything more will actually lead to compromising the model quality. They also tend(based on my own bias) to be non-coders, like statisticians, phds, analytics etc., and the technical aspects like package compatibility, resource limitations, pipeline and deployment don't really come to their mind. It's not that they are not bothered, it's just that they are not aware of the challenges engineers deploying the project face.I understand the challenges engineers face and it can be so frustrating. Awareness and communication between the two teams is important. Make them aware of the issues you face. Help them understand the importance of following coding standards. There are so many tools nowadays which can help with all these challenges, if the data scientists are aware of it, they will definitely use it to make your experience better and make the overall process faster and smoother.",

He did not achieve that goal, in part because it's difficult to measure an increase when you have no real base data.They are using AI as a buzzword and a way to make themselves appear like they're \"with it\". It's easy to say \"I'm going to help facilitate AI infrastructure growth\" or \"expand AI use\", but then what?I think AI is oversaturated. We had several different teams working on projects that were supposed to integrate our company data with ChatGPT (i.e. allowing business users to query company data) and then ChatGPT came out with a \"Company Knowledge\" feature (like 2 weeks ago) and all those teams are now looking for new projects to work on, but they wasted what I can only assume is months of development hours that the company paid for. This is not an isolated incident at my company - there are tons of AI projects with no real end goal other than \"enabling AI across the organization\".It's just crazy to me how many people at my company are working on AI projects, but don't really have any demand for these projects (at my company specifically).",

Can you package and scale that with CI/CD?There are lots of folks that were able to survive on just parts (only EL, only transform, only cloud infra). The best DEs I know have the cloud infra (Infrastructure-as-code, IAM, storage, horizontal and vertical scaling) because that's the hard foundational part.

Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way. But data engineers need to be better informed about DQ and push hard for architectures, tools, and processes they need.",

The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B.

Basically it didn't contain a flag that would have resolved it.I hit some limitation of some system because excluding any more matrix rows would break the visual. So, we had to go to DE to fix it upstream anyways :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: we were told they were mid migration and wouldn't do any new work.

This is called bronze in a medallion architecture - A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the \"single source of truth\" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools. This is what most users will ever see. In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.The 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.Besides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size. Again, some will disagree.",

The people who do understand how it works have a hard time explaining it to them and they might not have the patience and humility to listen. Which brings me to my next point. In my experience, doing DE doesn't necessarily mean I don't have to deal with people, presentations, and politics. I deal with that stuff a lot. Maybe not every DE does, but I find myself constantly put in positions where I have to coordinate with cross-functional groups of people or make presentations about how stuff works or what problems we discovered. That said, I hated the kinds of \"people\" work I had to do before, but don't hate it as much as a DE. Part of it is because I have supportive leaders who want me to do this stuff, and the other part of it is that you usually know what you're going to get out of a DE project so it's easier to propose and explain.",

At the same time I really liked the engineering part of things as the focus of my study was always on the computational side of things. At some point back then I remember getting super interested in Spark and did a small project with it. It turns out that there is another team using it already and then I joined that team as a junior data engineer.

This was not the case at tech companies, but by the time I worked there, I was software engineering anyway (data engineering -> ML Ops deployments -> software engineering), so the line was blurred. Also I studied software engineering.For your case, I recommend focusing on the 'Python' part of those skills, and doing the areas that you enjoy like pipelines and process automation. Companies have inefficient processes and need people that can understand the underlying data and the business, as much as the tech. If you can keep doing great work in those areas, without losing sight of the business context, you will do great, and lots of opportunities will continue to open up for you!",

While none of us can say for sure what the exact technologies will be (other than that sql will still be around) I can tell you with complete certainty that the engineers who pursue mastery of their stack will always be in demand. Every technology you use is likely deeper than your current use of it. If you make a habit of digging a bit deeper each time you work on something you will build greater mastery than many of your colleagues - a lot of people just want to do the work and go home, after all.If you pursue that mastery you should easily find interesting work as a senior data engineer (meant as a description, not necessarily as a title). If you envision the staff+ roles in your future, then combine that deep technical mastery with a product mindset. What is the business rationale? What is the use case for that request? (this one will start to annoy people who are accustomed to always getting their requests fulfilled) How does this look when you imagine the results? (we have a habit of over engineering, when all they wanted was a gut check).I should probably write this out with more thought beforehand. Yet another thing to add to my to do list.",

Learn about UDFs, parquets, partitioning, merges and SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) and merge statements. API ingestion patterns and different ways you can authenticate, paginate and any frameworks. If you ho with databricks, pick Delta Live Tables, Databricks asset bundles, streaming tables etc and almost certainly CI CD. DbT would be another thing to think off.

However, if that initial part is done properly, most of the work later on becomes analytical engineering (aka, translating business needs into sql queries).Learn Polars instead of Pandas. But in fact, if you want to seriously learn DE, focus more on SQL / relational databases (for the base) + distributed computing / operational vs analytical databases.Get the books \"Designing Data Intensive Applications\" (amazing, cant recommend enough. It will give you a great understanding on why certain tools exist and why they are relevant) and \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" (from Joe Reis. Quite basic book, but great if you are starting)",

        "body": "I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under \"control\" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever. Also, there are routine things, but most of the time we are thinking in new ideas, so we are free to be creative.If you have any questions I am glad to answer them!",

The concepts you learn building in Azure Data Factory (for example) will allow you much more easily learn something like Airflow versus if you were just learning it from scratch.Also, the vast majority of companies you apply to already use at least one of these and your audience becomes a lot bigger if you are an \"Azure expert\" vs. a \"Snowflake expert\" or a \"PySpark expert\". You can definitely learn any tool you want, but you also need to consider the market and what jobs will be available when you're ready....Almost all of the major tools like Data Factory, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Snowflake, XYZ123, etc. and so on will all be around in the next couple years, but if you focus on something like dbt, for example, you're going to only have a handful of companies that use that and only like 1%-20% will give you an interview - so just keep this in mind if you learn less popular tools.",

There will be reports, there will be dashboards, there will be analytics there will be god knows what.Whatever will be the next hype cycle in the world data, companies still need their infrastructure running. As the old joke goes, whenever a data scientist joins a company, the first question they ask is 'well do you have a data infrastructure running?' and the answer is mostly no.AI/ML is really interesting and there is space for innovation. DE work is less innovation, but more hands on problem solving. I liked working in both. You can still transit from DE to AI/ML easily, you'd have a very solid foundation.I'd vouch for DE with an AI/ML flavour. If the market shifts, then you can become DE with a something else flavour (e.g. bit of analytics on side. Dashboarding maybe?). You already have an ongoing experience with AI/ML, combine that with a solid expertise in DE and you have good chances ahead I think. I'm sure i'd be happy to have someone like that on my team.Some skillset i'd recommend overal: strong grip on SQL and Python is already given for you which is great. Add understanding PySpark on top (with Spark generally), add a good understanding of a cloud provider (Azure or AWS, some relevant resources) add a data platform skill on top (Databricks or Snowflake). Get a basic understanding of OOP, maybe implement a simple pipeline platform in OOP for an example project.The market will always change and shift and we always had to adapt. Learning never stops in either field, but i agree that AI/ML is currently steeper than DE. If you cant land a DE role, go for a Data Analyst with (and i cant emphasise this enough) heavy tech skills orientation. Many business views DA jobs business only and not IT. I started off with a DA job and I was an SQL monkey for a year. I actually quite liked it, then i transitioned into DE with a very strong SQL base knowledge.i hope i could be useful.",

Also, attributes could be added in the source system without notice. Rather than casting/flattening, I decided to leave this as an array/object. This makes the pipeline more durable and cleaner, and analysts can cast depending on their use case.If a particular set of nested keys were regularly used, it might make more sense to flatten it out, or make a separate view e.g. [customer, attribute_key, attribute_value].I use Snowflake to manage the above scenarios.",

We don't run distributed for processing, Polars + custom Rust UDF on 2 server with 4TB of RAM each goes really really far. \"scan don't read\". Some GPU compute nodes and some lower perf compute nodes when it doesn't matter. We also use Airflow, it's fine, not amazing, not awful either.No vendor lock-in is really nice, we can deploy a whole \"mini\" version of our whole stack using docker compose for dev. Dev flow is great.Our user facing serving APIs are not on prem tho. It's just a big Rust stateless modulith with Tonic gRPC, Axum for REST and the data queries/vector queries are using LanceDB/Datafusion + object storage + Redis. Docker Swarm and Docker stack for deployment. We hit around sub-70ms P95, trying to get it down to sub-50ms it's really awesome.Most people stack is wayy to complex and wayy to overengineered.Edit: Some of the compute for ETL (more ELT) is on VPS in the cloud tho, but it feeds the on-prem setup. Edit: We do use Runpod a bit for bigger GPUs too. Buying those GPU for on-prem compared to Runpod pricing doesn't really make that much sense.",

The budget cycle is annual, so if you miss it, you could be waiting a long time. At one point while I was there, the lead time to get new hardware capacity for the on prem data lake was more than a year. So that means, you have to be able to project your needs a couple years in advance, to be able to get what you need when you need it.Needless to say, that limits how quickly you can respond to the market and changing external circumstances. It is true that large enterprises are like a huge container ship - takes a long time and plenty of advance notice to steer the ship in a new direction.Tech-wise, it is similar. Behind on latest tech due to how long it takes to get them into the company. In the meantime, use older tech that is reliable and has been vetted.",

General dev pods for engineers/devs/datascientists 100 GB NIC. Use case is a bunch of image processing some machine learning . 7 servers 6 compute with storage in and 1 GPU node might expand to more depending. Most work isn't LLMs but Machinelearning and Vision. Data is mix between Postgres/small appdbs and lots of blob storage. 2 GPU for LLM 2 GPU for other work. Probably need a few more GPU nodes depending on how much more people want to GPU accelerate. Whole stack is open source and currently dreading about Bitnami pulling up the ladder on container maintenance/closed sourcing stuff. Current stack about $300k recurring costs for software about 1k/node/year(OS License). My time and sanity however are not tied to a dollar amount. On prem for Security/cost once yo u start getting into PB scale or higher in data those cloud ingress/out fees along with storage capacity add up if you want it hot you can play with the Azure/AWS storage calculator to see. Cloud storage is great for arctic/freeze data for backups or old data costwise if you can spare it so hot -> cold cloud was always a good discussion.Took us a long time to organically set this up from scratch and bare metal and learn from scratch but I was happy for the opportunity.

DevContainer would probably get lumped in here as well. It's how I start most of my new projects these days.Ci/cd, IaC, branching strategies, feature flags, tdd, etc are also critical skill sets for any engineer.Terraform is a good investment if you work in the cloud.The rest of it is moving, shaping, analyzing, and orchestrating data which is all table stakes for a DE. It sounds like you have the important bits down, but do consider spark to gain an understanding of parallelized data processing.

Use GitHub Actions to run dbt tests, unit tests, build/push Docker images, and deploy DAGs. Add data quality with Great Expectations or just lean on dbt tests to start. Build one real pipeline: ingest NYC Taxi or NOAA data with Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub, land in GCS, load to BigQuery, model in dbt, schedule with Airflow, and publish a small dashboard; write a short readme on tradeoffs and costs.Spark is nice to know, but on GCP I’d learn Apache Beam/Dataflow first; if you still want Spark, run it locally with Docker to practice partitioning and joins on a few GB. For quick APIs over curated tables, I’ve used Hasura and PostgREST; DreamFactory also helped when I needed secure REST endpoints for Snowflake/BigQuery-backed services.Focus on one cloud and ship end-to-end; that pays off fastest.",

Then when you launch vscode in the project directory it will ask to relaunch inside the container. So now not only do you not need to mess up your computer with a bunch of installs and conflicting versions to work on multiple projects locally, other folks working on the project will have the exact same local environment as you since the devcontainer config is part of the project. And I get it with kubernetes. It takes a little work to get your head wrapped around it, but it's worth the effort. Think of it like a giant server upon which you host your containers (called pods in k8s) plus all of the tooling to make them speak to each other as needed, or share secrets, or keep them alive if they fail, or scale them on demand, or a million other quality of life things.",

The default out the package snowflake io manager is also kind of wonky and can not handle situations where the data frame is blank (think a job ran and there was no new data). You can use multi asset decorator to deal with this quite well.AssetSelection for jobs can get annoying if you have a mix of dbt source + ref tables in them. There should be an ability to override skipped materializations so that they don’t cascade down the dag override downstream materializations. If I have 3 ingestion branches that are referenced in a downstream table, if one of those branches doesn’t have new or updated data, then I don’t want to churn the tables. I wish I could in that case mark specific assets with a “Skipped but successful” status so that if there was new data in the one of the other branches the final table rematerialized to include the new data. I know in this scenario the 3 ingestion branches could be separate jobs but that feels messy.",

Make it your managers problem to decide what the most important things to do are. User angry that their thing didn't get prioritized? Sorry, user, it was out of your hands. You don't control prioritization. Start logging off on weekends/nights unless you're explicitly on call to support a very important thing. It can usually wait until you're back in the office. Most deadlines are made up. Some aren't (Legal/Regulatory/Things that directly cost or make money), but most things aren't in those categories.

It has a visual builder and this shouldbe enough for your analysts to build their own pipelines and run transformation before data hits Redshift. Also has fixed pricing so thats a plus.",

With this you can simply connect your end DB directly to the iceberg catalog as the front and get a good performance as the majority of them have native iceberg connectors.

The most complicated schema change IMO is usually changing the cardinality of the link (from 1:N to N:M or vice versa). If you're just adding elements (entities, links, attributes) then it would be easy, assuming that your database does not have too heavy traffic. But even then you could use things like side tables that are trivial to create without service interruption.\\> Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better?Depending on what you mean by \"putting more efforts\".\\> How should I know is my design is already fine?Uhm, I have an entire book that tries to answer your questions.

I can't find a way for that except just making a long list of notes on when they took a leave, and then adding back the number of sessions they took a leave. It is a mess. After all that mess, my manager still wanted me to also keep track of transactions in the monolithic spreadsheet. Well, that's the bell for me, I need to make this right. Haha.And then I also need to synchronize this excel sheet to an external spreadsheet for my sales team, and my company is a bit warry of google, so they don't want me to completely upload everything on there, I then need to manually select them, copy them, and make sure I don't copy the wrong stuff, and it's hard to synchronize the data if sales team managed to change some of it. Well, all and all, I also think this is a great opportunity for me to learn RDB, since I didn't have any hands-on experience with it, aside from vibe-coding a project using prisma etc, which I don't have any idea about anyway.",

Build a committee with folks from DE, analytics, SRE, and ML to review across stacks. Use Discord/Slack for comms and Sessionize or Sched for scheduling.For demos, think Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms, and DreamFactory for auto-generating secure REST APIs from databases when you need to expose curated tables.For OP in the US, near-term vendor-light options: Data Council (Austin/SF), QCon data tracks, PyData, and ODSC East/West if you pick the DE sessions.Start local with clear rules and you’ll have a real vendor-neutral data conference fast.",

I cannot answer precisely on business wins as I had less exposure to end business users.From my experience, I can tell that it works well when there is a consuming/business team driving MDM with proper requirements and goals. Slowly it can evolve and become an enterprise level golden data layer by onboarding other business groups. This becomes a single source for multiple departments and business teams within an organization, this in itself solved a lot of things and improves productivity and business insights.Examples I have seen,- better(faster) customer onboarding and handling with the Customer master.- Improved vendor insights using supplier mastering.- I have not done product master implementation but I have seen a lot of top companies doing that as well.Cons:- MDM projects might fail if an organization fails to involve a business rep (MDM requires a lot of business involvement to deliver)- MDM projects unnecessarily extend and fail to deliver if an organization has short term vision- Vendor lock might be a problem as MDM is offered as a Software product- Sometimes it can be too complex- Before bringing mdm it is important to educate clients on what value MDM can provide and what are the limitations of MDM. It might sound absurd but I have seen a couple of projects cancelled midway due to this.Please let me know if my answer is naive. I am improving as a MDM Engineer and the feedback will help me.",

When you actually try to match and master records, the golden record doesn’t just magically appear; it evolves over time. Usually, it starts with picking a key domain, like customers or products, getting your sources talking, and slowly cleaning duplicates and standardizing fields.The small wins are honestly the best part: fixing just one field or deduping a batch can save hours later. The bigger insight is that MDM isn’t just about tech; it’s as much about processes, rules, and deciding who owns what data.

And without somewhere to reconcile them all to one customer record, every downstream instance suffers So the MDM team creates master data tables that are referenced in ETL flows created by the date engineering So the data engineering team extracts data from a source, reconciles it against master data, and drops it in the enterprise data warehouse It's not perfect. The teams are all spread thin and the company is still not there with process maturity overall But, being able to have one team just focus on defining what the \"truth\" is with the business is awesome",

It breaks down queries into how much I/O, cpu, logical reads, how the joins were working, what indexes and searchs are being used etc. It does a really nice visual representation of the query plan including how many rows are flowing between one stage and the next. You can then make changes to the query, add indexes etc, and compare the info. I used to get such a kick from reducing a humungous query taking 10 mins to run and doing millions of logical I/Os to e.g 3 seconds and 1% of the original logical I/O.As a rule, the quicker you can limit how much is being read and computed, the better a query will perform. So if i am joining millions of rows to millions of rows and THEN filtering or aggregating, that is going to require a lot more reads and memory. If i can filter the incoming data first or aggregate it, then do my joins, it will run much sweeter.",

I have applied to a handful of senior+lead roles in the past two years and received two offers, but ultimately declined both.I suggest you should target \"modern\" tech firms & startups who anyway have more international colleagues and need quality talent, thus they are ready to compromise on German knowledge. Think places like Sportradar, Microsoft, Entain, N26, Dynatrace, etc. Forget companies who serve the local market like ÖBB, REWE, etc.Also while Vienna is one of the most liveable cities in the world, since the local tech scene is not that big, so IT jobs do not pay that well compared to cost of living. If optimizing for $$$, you may be even better off in some eastern EU countries.

(Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual. It's deeply structural.",

        "body": "I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this. People usually either just give up on referential integrity, or limit the time window and select everything rather than random sample.",

        "body": "I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",

Gdpr has many facets and some are taken less serious than others and the serious ones are easy to implement with RLS and the likes.

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",

Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky. In some highly regulated organizations that are still immature, I have seen them hire data governance specialists before they even have data teams or a CDO. In those cases, the governance expert ends up sitting under legal or some other non data function. That is where it becomes ugly.",

No tool, Iceberg or otherwise, can magically guess that your name column is semantically equivalent to the first\\_name column in a new schema version. That's business logic that has to be codified somewhere. Iceberg solves for physical compatibility - it ensures you can still read old Parquet files after a schema update by tracking columns via internal IDs, not names, but it doesn't solve for logical compatibility - presenting a stable \"view\" of the data to your consumers. That's what a transformation layer, like dbt, is for. You land the messy, multi-version data in a \"raw\" Iceberg table, and then build a clean dbt view on top of it that uses logic like coalesce(first\\_name, name) to give your downstream systems a consistent, predictable schema. Iceberg is the foundation, but you still need to build the house",

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go. If your environment is stupid complex per tenant, we used to have terraform project creation to deploy tenant environments and then you can provide permissions for airflow to run compute/etc in those projects. Then you can track everything at the Project level and put them under a folder to ease IAM.",

This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\\_id, task\\_id, and most importantly, customer\\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a \"good enough\" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\\_in\\_hours \\* cost\\_per\\_hour\\_of\\_worker. It's not perfect - you'll miss network and disk I/O - but it'll get you 80% of the answer for 20% of the effort and help you find your most expensive tasks",

For machine learning specifically, grab Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning or Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie et al. Both are heavy on the math but that's what you want.Stanford CS229 is available free online with full lecture videos and notes. Andrew Ng teaches it properly with the linear algebra and calculus you'd expect. MIT also has open courseware for their AI courses. The key is following actual university syllabi rather than random YouTube channels. Look up what MIT, Stanford, or Berkeley require for their AI graduate programs and work through that material in order.For deep learning, Goodfellow's Deep Learning book is rigorous. Then pick a specific area and dive into papers. ArXiv is your friend. Start with foundational papers in whatever subfield interests you, read them with a notebook, derive the math yourself. Implement things from scratch in numpy or pure Python before touching frameworks. Most importantly, work through the exercises in the textbooks. Reading isn't enough - you need to solve problems and prove things.",

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse. The only thing I know is that I won't stop anymore and maybe it will lead to somewhere, maybe it won't but even if not then it will stay a lifelong hobby for me that I do in my freetime like I do now.",

If I want to get good I know that I have to keep coding, writing code, understanding and structuring logic consistently.

Before I went to uni, I mostly knew C and C++, and a bit of Python; at uni, I picked up Java and a lot more Python (and did some hacking on the Python interpreter, which means C…and was briefly exposed to more languages like ARM assembly, Prolog, and others); an early job was in PHP, which I basically didn’t know at all until I started; and for the past number of years, I’ve done very well in my career with mostly Typescript. Plus of course bits and pieces of other things like bash scripts and what not.For the most part, programming is programming and the specific language doesn’t matter so much. Until you get into ‘weird’ languages (in different directions: assembly, Scheme, Haskell…), *most* of the skills will transfer. Most of the skills have to do with problem-solving and structural aspects that don’t depend all that much on language.All of which is to say that you can’t go too far wrong. C++ is fine. Java is fine. Python is fine. Typescript is fine. Rust and Go are fine. In your career, you’ll probably use it—and then go many years without even seeing it.Do make sure to pick up SQL somewhere along the way, though. Regardless of the main language used in a system, there’s a pretty good chance that *something* at your job will require you to interact with databases using SQL, which is a *very* different experience from imperative languages with Algol-family syntax, and initially not very intuitive. (There are many dialects of SQL, so whatever you learn at first, you’ll have to learn more nuances later; but the basics are consistent across tons and tons of DB systems.)",

I am a mathematics graduate who minored in data science and computer science, enough to focus on software engineering as my full-time job.My reasons are not degree based, but content based. I find it very hard to get motivation without structured, grade-based, financially-committed learned. That is, online free MOOCs are difficult for me to complete and actually learn. The masters program definitely breaks this barrier by putting my academic reputation on the line, and hitting my wallet!In my undergrad, there were a few gaps I had being a mathematics major. I never had a formal operating systems, database, or computer networks course. Thus, my first glass is in operating systems and I'm learning a ton through the projects, including client-server programming in C, IPC (shared memory and message queues), operating system design, and so much more. Note that I am doing this while I work a full-time job as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. So I'm learning from multiple angles. My focus in my program is to learn several computer science fundamentals that I missed and some new ones, and then transitioning to some more AI/ML related topics and applications in robotics, computer vision, etc.Do I think that an official masters degree in name is worth it alone? No. Don't get the masters if it's just about getting the degree. Do I think that an official masters degree is worth it for the structured learning and content? Definitely yes. I've only been in the program for 3 months and I've already learned so much. I'll take some classes on things I'm not familiar with and some new cutting edge features in computer science. Now there are some careers I'm interested in that start with having an advanced degree, but it's more of a convenience that I'll get that requirement than it is a motivating factor.Will it help your job outlook? Maybe, but it depends on what you take from it. If you have a masters or undergrad in computer science, but can't program anything or speak on certain subjects, you likely won't get the job. Believe it or not, this is a common thing that happens. This is the reason why cheating and similar is discouraged. Not just because it is dishonest, but because you won't learn anything by researching documentation and spending hours trying different things out. That's where the learning happens.The masters program I am in is Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). From what I understand, this program is very welcoming to non-CS undergrads, but you need to be able to speak on your abilities to accept the intense CS workload. If you don't know a single thing about computer science or programming, you won't succeed. Luckily, there are plenty of programs out there to get up to speed and demonstrate some basic (non-exhaustive) requirements before entering the program.Good luck, hope this helps.",

E.g. setting up hardware via registers (like a bootloader or OS would), using very specific features directly (e.g. hand-rolling SIMD like in ffmpeg codec impls) etc.The applications of reading it are wider, e.g. performance (where it matters at this level), verifying compiler output e.g. did you hit some UB and give the compiler carte blanche to \"optimise\" your code in an unintended way? etc.It's also not that difficult to pick up the basics if you already know how a computer works, so a skill well worth having if you're interested enough. You probably won't write anything in it at work outside of specific job roles.Edit to say: ARMv8 (and ARM in general) has slightly less historical weirdness and is easier to learn that amd64 IMO, if you want to buy a cheap arm SoC or you have a Mac with apple silicon.

Later switch to TypeScript and learn the Angular UI framework, and you will have a highly marketable skill.Another worthwhile first language that is production ready is C#. You can use a Game Engines like Godot or Unity to learn it. Using a game engine will give you plenty of engaging ways, to visualize what you do and will keep you motivated to follow through, as you will be able to create very nice programming challenges in a game world setting.Another highly regarded option for a first language to learn is Python.As always, feel free to check some job sites to see how many job openings exist for a certain language or skill if you need advice about what to learn.",

I got into math because I wanted to draw pictures on a computer. Or maybe music _and_ computers.Use your hobbies / interests to guide what you might _do_ with a computer. A lot easier to work hard on something you like that it is to work hard on something that is boring.So to answer you question:If I were starting again _today_ I'd play with [nandgame.com](https://www.nandgame.com/) to learn a _little_ bit about how computing hardware works.Then maybe a class on \"From Nand to Tetris\".I might see how far I could go at [https://www.khanacademy.org/computing](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing).I'd look for cool projects on youtube or [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) and try to make one of them. Maybe look for a robotics team if your school does that sort of thing.I might get a RaspberryPi or two and study networking.I might read up on how to program simulations and enter a science fair or two.I might see if I could get some books like this from my school library book loan system:[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution - 25th Anniversary Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution).[Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age](https://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895)The reason I like these 2 books especially is they're about people who _created_ things that changed the world.

Also, you generally need a master's for a lot of those jobs here. I would focus more generic Computer Science undergrad then decide specialization at master's.And quite frankly if you are considering Data Science or AI, just go straight for ML then. That's the in between. That's probably what you are thinking. Actual AI jobs are for PhDs. And Data Science teams are some of the first to get removed when companies lay off employees.(personally for me)* Which would you choose today if you were starting fresh? * I would say to avoid data science or front end. Those two are generally in for rough times. * I would heavily consider C++ and focus on Operating Systems, Networking, Databases, Robotics (+ Computer Vision). It's a niche language but there's also very little talent in that space. And it opens you up to robotics, firmware optimizations, autonomous vehicles, military weapons, high frequency trading firms, AR/VR applications, game development, platforms like Figma.* How's the job market overall comparing between these two? * AI needs PhD. What you are thinking is ML. ML generally needs Master's as well and pays the biggest premium currently but is also very very competitive. * Data Science needs Master's and generally the talent is quite flooded because the talent bar is overall lower in that field. And some of the first in chopping blocks in a market downturn. Hence I would personally avoid it unless you really like Data Science.* Any regrets or \"wish-I-knew\" advice before committing to one path? * I wish I studied Operating Systems in school.To be quite frank though, do what you like. All these fields are fine if you are willing to put in the hours and keep learning. I'm a web dev today. And it seems for web dev world, it's now expected with LLMs that Backend Engineers do fullstack. Note I said Backend doing full stack, not Frontend.When I look at job requirements today, a lot of employees are looking for one/two of: full stack (who is backend main - typescript + java/python), Go, C++/Rust.It does feel C++ is more futureproof though as the language forces one to actually understand how memory, pointers, etc works under the hood. And realistically most students will run away from actually learning C++ in life.",

He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.Starting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't \"optimal\". \"'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?\" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \\*was\\* more efficient. \"Benchmarks?\" ....\"no...I never benchmarked it\". \"What cases does it work with\"....\"oh..this and that and the other....\". His response was \"how do you know?\". \"I tested it!\" .....\"No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works.\" I responded indignantly \"but it's slower\". \"By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?\"\"Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?\" .... \"I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?\" ....\"Yeah....\"....\"Then do it the next time you change that code\". It never had to change. I never put it back.If I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.If you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work. It \\*might\\* work. But you don't know that. You don't know what it is expected to handle. You don't know how its author was intending it to be used. I became an instant convert to unit testing after this. This happened in about 2004 before unit testing really became considered mandatory. I'm glad the industry has changed in this regard.",

Also, certification from these big giants really matter when you apply for any job.and yeah, coursra is good too but more theoretical than hands-on.

First, you get a general picture of what the program should do (top down) and then, you drill deeper into each of the features. Track everything - in plain text, bulleted lists, whatever. Don't even think about programming at that stage. Once you have a clear picture of your program, you start to flesh out each individual part (bottoms up) - again, only on a textual, conceptual level.You have to ensure to really understand the project. You cannot solve what you don't understand.Also, do not get lost in intricate details. Flesh out the *core functionality* first, make a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and then add the details. E.g. if you were to develop a ToDo list, focus on adding, deleting, changing individual items. Then, on saving/loading, then on the GUI, etc.There are several books that can help here:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldForget about the programming languages that these books use.

        "body": "First of all, you have your boiler plate stuff. Creating the solution and the main project, setting up configuration. I have separate projects for different parts.* Main program - UI / API (+web) * Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional. Then I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.I then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each \"domain\". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",

At the next juncture I decided to pick a window manager technology, so I picked KDE driven by Cmake, so then:* Make a Window class to wrangle all of the above* Build in some virtual controls for more parameters to tweak* Build an ADSR class because I totally forgot that* Lay out full suite of controls (ADSR for both filter and amplitude, LFOs, filter controls, etc)It's really just a matter of figuring out what the boundaries are between components and developing them in a piecemeal fashion.I also have a space sim engine that I'm working on if you're interested in hearing how I got from zero to \"fly around in a single ship in an empty universe\".",

However, some places to start are basic programming language topics like variables, control structures, and data structures. Each of these will exist within pretty much every programming language. You should learn multiple languages. You should learn problem-solving skills. You should learn debugging skills, version control, and be familiar with at least one developer tool(IDE). You should also have communication skills because gone are the days of the nerd locked away in the steam tunnel. You have to be able to communicate and explain technical concepts to both technical and nontechnical audiences. You should learn how to document both your code and possibly write technical documentation. You should understand how to collaborate with other developers so that you can integrate code. Also know that everything you learn now will likely become slowly obsolete. So, expect a lifetime of constantly learning new tools, languages, and technologies.Good luck",

        "body": "I would suggest you define some reasonable piece of software that you want to build (don't set your goal at \"an Amazon clone\" for this) and start with a blank page. What is the first step you must take? You must get your empty script running in the page (unless you're using node, which you probably aren't) so you're going to either place a script src reference at the bottom of your html body or you are going to script an immediately invoking function expression in a script tag at the bottom of your body.An IIFE looks like this: (function(){//do stuff})();Then you have to decide what you want to do. Don't bang your head on the desk if you don't know how to do it. It's simply a framework for you to gauge your progress rather than working out the simple language elements without the structure of an actual goal.Good luck",

LLMs don’t rank pages like Google does; they interpret them.From what I’ve seen while experimenting on a few AI-integrated projects, models tend to favor sites that are semantically clean, have clear headings, simple hierarchy, and minimal clutter. They don’t care about backlinks or meta tags; they care about context clarity.Think of it like this: instead of keyword density, LLMs look for meaning density. The cleaner the structure, like H1 → H2 → lists → short paragraph, the easier it is to turn into embeddings that make sense during retrieval.It’s a mix of HTML parsing + embedding similarity. The model doesn’t want to guess what the content means; it wants to know with high confidence before it recommends it.I’ve noticed smaller sites win here because they’re often simpler: fewer pop-ups, less CSS noise, and more direct semantic HTML. Basically, the easier it is for a model to read like a human, the more likely it is to surface that content.",

When the model only has access to the static surface of the page, anything that depends on heavy JavaScript or dynamic rendering tends to get lost. It basically reduces the site to whatever is easily tokenizable.I also noticed the same complexity effect you mentioned. Once a site has too many layers, widgets, modals, marketing blocks, or “creative” layout choices, the core meaning gets buried. The model can’t reliably extract one clean representation of what the business does, so it defaults to safer, simpler sources.And you’re right about agents. They can technically navigate and interpret more, but the cost and latency make them impractical for widespread retrieval. So most LLM-powered answers still depend on very plain, parseable structure.It’s interesting to see how that pushes the web back toward clarity.

Docker was just a small part of it. All docker does is containerize individual processes. You can use either your own docker “images” or install them from docker.io or other registry. Images are basically just scripts to run the application. Kubernetes is a lot more complicated to understand but it gets pretty easy once you get to the heart of it. Services are what matter in kubernetes. They take the containerized application and assign an id to them. Since kubernetes deals with multiple ports if you were to handle it traditionally you would have to manually allocate ports to reroute traffic, however services work to reroute the traffic automatically to the assigned port of your application. If you want to practice you could probably use virtualbox to create a few vms and try to connect them.",

For most of these, you shouldn't just be reading them, but simultaneously doing the problems in the books and applying the knowledge to something outside of that too.I am not familiar with all the books, but if you don't have a book on programming languages you should, e.g. look up Concepts of Programming Languages by Sebesta as an example.One book not on there that I would very highly recommend is the Linux Programming Interface.

It's probably better to reference it for patterns as you read other books.You can also skip K&R C if you already know how to use C well. It's a terrific manual for the language, but it's just that.

It's not just the language is different, but the registers and addresses are different as well. So different architecture requires a different binaries i.e. you need to compile for architecture. OS has the same problem, but on the other side. Your applications needs to interface with the OS, and different OS has its own quirks. For example, Linux vs windows uses foward-slash / double back-slash for paths; Windows adds a carriage return to the end of line, and Linux doesn't. There are a lot of other difference in permissions, networking, filesystem, etc. i.e. you need to compile for OS. The OS doesn't do the work for you. The OS runs on top of the processor, and can only ask the processor to do work that the processor already do eg. execute this binary. It's the same as how a mobile app is not actually doing the work but is instead asking the phone to do it. So in the same way, you have Android apps, and you have Apple apps i.e. compiled to different OS.",

Those opcode, operand instructions use the instruction set of their target processor. The opcodes are literally switch settings that direct the operands to the physical hardware gates in the cpu. Your OS is not going to do any final compilation of your program. It’s going to load machine code into an isolated virtual memory space and control physical memory storage, swap space, and cpu time vs other managed processes. It will also provide mediated access to hardware via OS calls. You still have to compile for the right cpu architecture and OS. Virtual machines like the Java JRE let you start with a semi-cpu agnostic median build that is JITted into machine code at runtime. The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard.

        "body": "I am not a REST evangelist, but the STANDARD approach to REST is that an endpoint set should refer to a RESOURCE, and a good litmus test for that is \"can I assign an ID to it without it getting weird\". And then you spread CRUD operations (create read update delete) across the verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for that resource. If you're more familiar with SQL, thinking about how you'd normalize the tables and what gets a primary key can kind of give you an idea what a \"resource\" or \"entity\", etc. would be.In your case, I'd probably have something more like1. POST /api/cart - CREATE a new CART2. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId} - Update metadata about the CART {cartId} (not necessarily its sub objects)3. POST /api/cart/{cartId}/item - CREATE a new item in cart {cartId}4. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId}/item/{itemId} - UPDATE an existing item in cart {cartId} with the id {itemId}. Your quantity update would go here.For the item model I'd probably have something like (BASIC) itemId // the id of the CART item productId // the id of the product in your catalog quantityNote I dont put things like PRICE, etc. in there: the PRODUCT linkage should let you get the price of the product in your catalog and do the math to present price information. You don't want to put things like that in your cart model, because it gives attackers a target to EDIT something they shouldn't, and suddenly they can update something in the cart to give it a price of $0. There are like a half dozen different suggestions about proper security design that go along with that, and I know you didn't ask about that, so I'm not going deeper.Also note that endpoint split is a little obvious for REST stuff, but there's others that aren't as obvious: like do you have an endpoint for SHIPPING information, OR is shipping information just part of a CART update call? ie:1. POST api/cart/{cartId}/shipping - \"create\" a shipping record for cart {cartId}?2. PUT api/cart/{cartId} - or just update the shipping information on the cart record itself?These judgement calls can be driven by LOTS of things. I might want to split shipping info updates to its own endpoint because the UI segregation of that operation vs other cart update operations kinda suggests it. Or because my DB design says that \"ShippingInfo\" is a 1:1 record with a Cart, and I want to adhere a bit to my data structure case, or dozens of other reasons.Another fun one, what type of endpoint would you use for a SEARCH endpoint? By REST standards its conceptually a GET, but robust search often becomes a POST out of necessity of supporting larger POST bodies. Plenty of GETs in a larger ecosystem migrate to POSTs to support request bodies too, because REST doesn't really deal with that, and you absolutely will hit a point where you have to send a body on a GET at some point because URLs can't support the size. Be pragmatic when its called for.Hell you don't HAVE to use PUT for updates. I've seen plenty of people only use POST as just \"POST is an upsert\" instead of dealing with PUTs at all, or reserving PUTs for PATCH operations and using POSTs for full object updates. REST purists will get all up in arms about that but... you should really ignore them. Almost no one does the pure thing in reality.",

The _cart_ is the resource routed at /cart/{id} and the action you’re performing is a custom action addQuantity. I used a google/microsoft-ish convention for custom actions, but you could also do /cart/{id}/addQuantity (but this is a little less RESTful because addQuantity is an _action_ not a resource) or PATCH /cart/{id} (if you know the current quantity and can just PATCH in the correct new value).",

In actual development, which framework or language to use is usually dictated by the situation. For example, if the client’s system is in JavaScript, you can’t just use Python. If they want React, you gotta learn it and use it right away. So, there’s no framework that’s definitely worth learning or should be ignored. It’s just about using the right tool to solve specific problems.My advice is, if you really like Django but don’t have a project for it right now, why not come up with your own project? Build it and keep improving it. You’ll discover a lot of cool things about the framework along the way.But if you’re not super into Django, feel free to check out other languages and frameworks. There are tons of them out there. You might find one that you really love someday.I used to mainly work with Django and Flask until I started using React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS. I can’t say this setup is the best, but I just like it. So whenever I get the chance, I stick with this combo to get the job done.",

It's very opinionated, and whereas most other platforms allow you to make important architectural and code design decisions from scratch,  Django feels like a cage.Then again,  you have already invested a big deal of time on it, so make the best out of it. If I were you, I'd probably shift to Flask, and at the same time explore NodeJs (just pick a framework.. I suggest to keep your dependencies to a minimum,  and focus on clean architecture), and possibly NextJs or NuxtJs, as they seem to be dominating the job market right now",

Pointer stores adresses, not primitive values, so you get an error. Correct thing here would be allocating memory (excuse my C++) like `char* p = new char;` and then dereferencing it to assign the value to the memory block that you just allocated `*p = '\\n';`The thing with text in \" \" works because thats a string, and string type is const char* which is the same as char* so there is no unkown conversions.

He covers this dilemma, among other things, but one of the core principles of learning something deeply is to learn it directly. In other words, you should try to learn something in as close as its real-world application (whatever that means for you) as possible. What that looks like in real life is tackling that problem/project/assignment much earlier than when you feel ready. When you hit the concepts that you don't know is a signal to drill down *JUST ENOUGH* to overcome the hurdle in what you are currently doing. This means you will spend a lot of time in that uncomfortable space but what is often left unsaid is that is the exact space that learning solidifies. In fact a lot of the times the comfortable space is a lie; we trick ourselves into believing because we read and/or took notes on something we understand it, but the truth is if that knowledge is not applied it will decay extremely quickly.",

Computers, to begin with, have no concept of \"line\" and even less of \"curve\". They only have pixels - grid coordinates and even these don't mean anything to computers. Even if they had the concepts of \"line\" or \"curve\" and the math built in, they would still need to interpolate through several algorithms to produce the output on their natural display grid.If you were to hand draw your line, your hands intrinsically and sub consciously do very complex calculations similar to what computers do, plus, contrary to computers, you have your visual feedback loop. Try drawing a curved line in pitch dark as this is basically what a computer can see - nothing. Have you ever tried to draw a curved line on an \"Etch-A-Sketch\"? Similar problem. Or, get a CAD program to precisely draw your curved line. Or, get a 3D printer or a CNC machine to follow your curved path. All these are far from simple.Curves in general are no trivial math, no matter what algorithms or what curve systems you use. Every trigonometry or math professor will tell you that.What we humans classify as \"simple\" doesn't mean it is really \"simple\" in an objective manner.Computers are generally very dumb devices that are only good in one thing: calculatingYou have to tell them every single minuscule step that they have to perform.Once you accept that computers are extremely dumb and that you have to tell them every minuscule step you are on the right track to becoming a programmer. Stop assuming things, stop classifying things. Nothing ever is as \"simple\" as we humans see it. On the other hand, a task that might be impossible for you, like calculating with huge numbers, is trivial for a computer. Human classifications are worth nothing.",

Those force you to understand concepts, not just repeat steps.Programming isn’t about memorizing code snippets; it’s about learning how to break problems down logically. That takes time. You can spend *years* mastering a language, but the deeper understanding you’ll get from reading real docs and experimenting on your own will make everything “simple” feel much simpler over time.",

Barely anyone actually use a skateboard to move up and down the street but getting started will involve a lot of just going up and down the street.The same is true with coding. Almost no-one will write code to draw a curved line. But in order to get to the point where you don't need to do that yourself you have to get through the basics.

SQLite will let you (doesn't have complicated logic to stop you) do it, but then when you read the data back out, the type affinity will return INT equivalents from the floats that are stored.It may hide a few types of bugs like accidentally storing floats in an int col.

I, for example, would much rather write system plumbing than mess around with web browser JavaScript. Neither of them is more \"real\" programming than the other.Now, let's talk about software engineering, which might be what you're thinking of when you say \"programming\". It's a different discipline that **involves** programming but is mostly defined by turning programs that work well enough that they solve **your** problem into products that can solve the problem for more people. It very well might be that you would not like doing that. I do: I like figuring out how to make people's lives easier, which usually starts with helping them understand what is making their lives hard. I like a perfectly-tuned deployment that is memorialized by nothing but a line in a changelog somewhere.

It really doesn't matter, except that scripting is sometimes associated with people who lack comprehensive programming skills and often just copy and paste code without truly understanding why it works. Programming is more associated with the capability to write a full program from scratch and understand every bit of it. Also, sometimes scripting is the label when you are required to code more in short bursts, like attaching a little bit of code to some object like an event.

More difficult subjects will need more breaks, easier ones, less.Even though I'm not really a fan of it, I'll suggest the *Pomodoro Technique* here to start. You can always extend the intervals later.Also, it is far more important to stay consistent and do something every day, even if it is just a short time. Studying for 8 hours straight today and then not doing anything for several days will not help. Doing 1-2 hours per day consistently is far more efficient.Don't focus too much on theory.

Everyone gets in such a spot and they get through by reading code, documentation, test scripts, screen shots, and talking to users and other developers. Take notes, learn the dialog and key words of the Application and its users. You will get by.",

But politely, it’s not a college student at college.Now you will see a lot posers, and that could make you feel inadequate, but that’s not imposter syndrome. That’s some kind of insecurity that comes from believing the lies that others project. And nothing cuts through that like hard work and real experience.

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, \"signal processing\" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \\*massive\\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.Did I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks? This project planning can be difficult because it's more fun to dive in. It is a necessity...don't skip it. It will be more gratifying to get a small task done rather than have a big undefined task that slogs on and on.",

And these are all scenarios where a solution like site builders, CMS etc are not only easier, but often the most appropriate solution. Any experienced dev will tell you there's no point reinventing the wheel unnecessarily, and you really want to avoid building yourself from scratch anything that handles money or PII.Companies that do need custom web app development/maintenance, are hiring teams of them on long-term contracts or FTEs, via job postings/recruiters/consultancies, not from bloody Fiverr or the local community notice board. And that's almost exclusively larger businesses. Or smaller businesses run by inexperienced entrepreneurs whose eyes are bigger than their budgets, whom you should avoid.So yes they're hiring true full stack devs, they're as in-demand as ever, but not in the places you're looking. And between the economy & mass industry layoffs, cheap foreign labor, and the several-years-long influx of newbies who've been convinced a 6 week \"bootcamp\" is enough to get rich quick and that freelancing is the cheat code to success when real companies won't hire you; competition is pretty fierce so your work is cut out for you.If you truly want to attempt this you would avoid those freelancing platforms, that ecosystem is tailored towards small COTS solutions with short turnaround. Instead work on running your own business and getting industry connections, attracting clients etc for the kind of work you want to do. Basically run your own consultancy. Be prepared to subcontract, spend more time running a business than actually coding, and don't bite off more than you can chew. Best of luck though, I don't like your chances.",

You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff.

Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, \"wasting time\" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",

Who's gonna be better, a guy who uses AI only or a guy who actually knows what the hell hes doing but is using AI to do the bits hes too lazy to do?The thing is, theres a fundamental flaw in these LLMs. Im not educated enough to know if this can ever change, but the fact is, they dont produce the absolutely 100% correct answer. They produce the most common answerAnd most people are not that good, thats what average means. The average person is average. Roughly half are below average roughly half above, but onky the top 10/20/30% are considered actually good at things. Thats why we have \"AI slop\". The code it produces, unless its ridiculously common boilerplate code i.e. set up code for projects, it tends to be pretty much useless. At my job currently ive had two solve two problems, offline mode, and push notifications to progressive web apps. Theyre basically largely untouched areas. Theres few apps or codebases that deal with either of those, compared to a lot of other bits of code. I tried turning to AI and it was literally, no exaggerartion, useless for the infrastructure and logic side of things. What it has been helpful for is instead of having to sift through 100 websites and/or documentation and/or books and/or youtube/video tutorials for foundational things, i can use chatgpt and claude. And even then the free models are utterly useless. Ive had to pay for a monthly subscription because it takes about 10-20 attempts for it to give mr what I need.",

Then once you download and install the game engine, usually within the main interface, there's an icon with a link to their online manual. Bookmark that manual and start reading it as fast as you can. Then I'd see if that game engine has a YouTube channel or somewhere where they're posting free engine learning content, possibly their own website, and I'd pick a couple of their 'how to make game x' or 'how to make game y' series (usually varies by genre), and watch it about 3.5 times-5.7 times. If you have photographic memory, you may only need to watch the series 1.1-2.3 times, and I'm so jealous by the way. I don't have photographic memory. Then start making your game.",

It really forced you to try and understand and reason about what each step of the \"code\" was supposed to do and its effects, instead of just sitting with an editor doing pure trial and error, changing random values and variables when stuff doesn't go your way.I think the best way of learning, is to try to be as conscious and intentional about every decision you make along the way, and when it goes wrong, try to understand what in your reasoning process went wrong, rather than \"just\" be happy that u could fix it.",

If they have an operating system (e.g. linux) then you can use VM langs. These tend to be your bigger devices with more power. If battery operated customers really care about battery life. If you have 30,000 sensors around the country with button cells in, you want it to be 5-10 years before you have to replace those... so we use microcontrollers and C (sometimes C++). Custom protocols are sometimes seen, but LoRa(WAN) etc. are common too. You need to be comfortable at the bits-and-bytes level ideally. Good fundamentals in general software dev (data structures etc.), network programming, are necessary. The ability to understand a bit about hardware is a nice to have.You can also get into the networking and infrastructure side, or the distributed system design side of things, and of course you have standard app development to actually use the data from things like sensors and devices on the network etc.Cool field if you like to stick your fingers in many pies.Edit: Forgot databases. Ideally you would be comfortable with different types e.g. relational, hierarchical/document, columnar etc. SQL is great to have. All this device data is stored places.Also, knowledge of logs, queues, pub sub on the distributed/processing side of things. Services need to communicate etc.Edit 2: I should add that we wouldn't expect a junior/grad to come with all this, I'm just listing things you should be thinking about. This is a lot and every system is very different.",

        "body": "Here is a recent comment I made on Assembly, with some book suggestions. Tldr: \"Programming From The Ground Up\" is a good starter assembly book imo.Assembly is very useful if you have a need to craft custom executables without trying to wrangle a compiler. Having control to the byte level of an executable can be handy.For example, I have written x86 assembly in recent years to solve 2 problems.1: I wanted to make a hobby OS that can run on BIOS based computers, and to get that going, I needed a MBR (master boot record). So I wrote a 512 byte MBR in x86 assembly, since an MBR needs to be exactly 512 bytes, with a signature at byte 512. No idea how I could have done that in C or any other language.2: I wanted my Python program to export executables for vintage computing platforms. Think MS-DOS, C64, etc. I did not want my program to rely on cross-compiler packages or any of that crap. So, I used assembly to craft some executable code that would look for video data at the end of the file. I assembled that into a machine code blob, and have my program encode video data and append it to the blob when I want to export an executable. Now my program can spit out custom DOS and C64 programs, with 0 dependencies for the user.I found the book \"Programming From The Ground Up\" quite useful for getting my feet wet with assembly. After that, the books \"Advanced MS-DOS,\" \"EGA/VGA: A Programmer's Reference\" and \"Zen of Assembly Language\" became useful.Other obvious modern uses for assembly language are writing compilers, language virtual machines, reverse engineering, writing exploits.If you are writing for a microcontroller and need to use as few bytes as possible, assembly is the best way to optimize for space.As far as I know, hardware IO ports (x86 only?) are only accessible through assembly. C functions that do this wrap assembly code. This is necessary for writing some hardware drivers where memory-mapped I/O is not an option.If you want to try 6502 Commodore 64 assembly, this site has some great resources: https://codebase64.c64.org/",

Being software developer is more than Odin Projects and such. Better go for a degree. And how will it take 6 years for you? I can understand 3-4 years as this seems to be the norm. Or will you combine it with Master studies? In most places you won't need a Master degree for a junior developer position. Or, did you mean this 250 euros per month online university? Perhaps their study load is much lower and this is why it takes also more years for you to get a degree.What I did was dropping my work load to 50% and going to an actual university where I had to show up in person, sit in lectures, etc. Yeah, I had close to no free time for anything but study, work, eat, sleep, but I managed to get it done. With university your portfolio will be also better, you'll have connections from your course mates, from your professors, from your club mates (computer club and such). Your theoretical knowledge will be also stronger.And do not listen to the people who are fear mongering how the AI will take our jobs. It will not take any job. Learn to use it as a tool.",

I chose online university (iu distance learning) because it takes longer and I can go through the material more slowly, as I have to study alongside my 40-hour job. If I chose full-time university, it would take less time but it would be stressful. I've already tried to study in Austria, but I don't have a high school diploma, so I have to take additional courses to get in. I have to do that at IU too, but it's not as strict (e.g., how to write a bachelor's thesis and basic math, English, and German). There is a university in Vienna that is very strict, and many say that it is so difficult at the beginning that they can't get through it with a 20-hour work week. That's why online IU is probably the best choice for me. I also thought that I would study computer science in general (networking, software development, web development...) and do a master's in cyber security.Thanks for sharing your story. Self-study is good, but to avoid tutorial hell, you have to choose something specific. Ich habe kein Angst von AI weil ich habe teilweise benutzt.

I am self-taught software dev, it is my hard-earned experience. 3. If I were to start learning to code again, I would start with cs50. If you want to, just ask for a roadmap. 1. Learn react js. 2. Make one project not more than 2hrs from YouTube, don't try to make the entire software now. 3. Now you have intuition from the video how react is used in a project. Now build a simple login page or very small functionality using question-driven development. 4. Now do the same with any backend framework. I would recommend you go with Node js or express js as you don't need to learn another language. 5. We have other frameworks for Java, Python as well. 6. Why use framework. They make development easier. You just have to build the functionality. Everything else will be handled by a framework, you can think of them as template which you can use to create functionality.Every thing like routing, modeling layer will be defined in a framework(If you are not able to understand routing, modeling layer, middleware etc) don't worry you will learn with time.DO GOOGLE ABOUT JIT(JUST IN TIME LEARNING) OR QUESTION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT. Don't learn everything end to end.",

As a teen interested in digital electronics, I actually enjoyed making something as simple as an electronic counter - and convinced myself that I could use it to count how many push-ups I did :) If you are more into \"understanding\" than soldering, you can also build emulators and simulators, experiment with creating your own assembler or disassembler for a simple CPU, or play with languages and compilers, and create your own.

For front end, you can learn JavaScript and learn a related framework like React; you can then make a full stack app tying it all together.

Haskell has lazy eval, is functional, has great support for ADTs, interesting ad-hoc polymorphism system with type-classes etc. lot of those are things which you can realistically never have any experience with from JS/TS and it will enrich you to learn them.C is basically lingua franca of systems programming, everything has to interact with C ABI at some point so it’s worth knowing it. You can also learn about manual memory management that way. It can also teach you lot about parallelism if you start doing multiple processes and multiple threads. Again those are things which you won’t have any experience with from TS and it can help a ton to learn them.Beyond that learning a bit of assembly is always worth just because it can demystify bunch of stuff. Scheme and C++ are both very interesting if you want to learn what cool stuff you can do with compile time meta programming, since they these languages are kinda kings of that. Erlang and co can be interesting because of the OTP and in general CSP/Actor style concurrency. Learning prolog can be pretty interesting educational experiment since the whole highly declarative style of programming is very unlike anything you might see elsewhere. Elm is also really interesting take on declarative UI programming. Idris is amazing take on dependent type systems. Rust is obviously pretty cool and popular take on affine types etc. There is abundance of cool languages which can teach you a lot.The holy trinity of corporate languages (Java, C#, Go) are not particularly interesting, nor can you gain a bunch of great insights from learning them… Sure maybe some things about parallelism can be learned, and Java and Go are both decent enough takes on the whole CSP concurrency model, but mostly they are kinda boring, which is kinda the whole point of languages like that. Just ALGOLs with a coat of paint on (in C#’s case very ugly and bloated coat of paint).",

The course does create some organization for the people involved. I should say I don't know of a Discord group off the top of my head.Finally, to answer your question, not that I'm aware of.

You’ll feel good seeing how easy it can be to get something up and running with rails and then build the fundamentals.Rails guy here (just letting my bias be known). I’d say start poking around the rails guides and see what you can do. DHH has said he wants to make it really way for younger something on the screen, even if you don’t know how it’s working. You feel a sense of accomplishment which pushes you forward. Then you keep learning and never stop.https://guides.rubyonrails.org/After playing with rails a little maybe get the basics of Ruby?https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/Then maybe try to climb a mountain? The Odin project isn’t perfect (I’ve heard from people it may have some gaps or not explain everything as clearly or in as much detail as they would like). But if you supplement it with some google / chat gpt / reading docs / watching videos you can go a long way. It’s also free.https://www.theodinproject.com/Deployment / hosting / domainFor a few bucks a month you can toss a rails app with SQLite up on fly.io. You’ll get a subdomain they give you and also can add your own custom domain. I love them.Why SQLite? SQLite doesn’t require a database server. You basically read/write to a local file and that’s the database. For small to mid size apps it’s great. If you are lucky enough to need more rails will make it (relatively) easy to drop in MySQL or postgres. And by the time that happens you should have the knowledge or money to make it happen. LiteFs makes it so you can have one server be primary with reads and writes and then have your SQLite db replicated around the world to different servers acting as read replicas. Fly.io makes it so that all post/put/patch/delete requests go to the primary and get requests go to the geographically closest server. For things like verify a users account from an email - a get requests that ends up writing to the db you will need to have an intermediate page which auto submits a form and/or allows a user to click a button to do so. That way you just execute read from the email link and then a post request for a write. By the time you get to deployment all this will make more sense.https://fly.io/docs/rails/https://fly.io/docs/litefs/",

It's not a difficult project, which is good for getting it out in a reasonable time, and it's easy to scale it in different directions once its out (e.g., adding detailed pages for each track, track reviews, letting users store their lap times for each track, and even adding a booking service so users can book sessions directly on the site).As someone else already said, it's very motivating to develop something you're already interested in. And I think this project could apply to basically any interest to make it unique and to help people find what they are looking for. For example, golf courses, hair dressers, sushi places, chess clubs, music events, etc, etc. You don't even have to have a full list to begin with, just some examples, and then add some contact information to you where users can submit suggestions for things that are currently missing. Then you add over time.Hope that gave you some ideas at least.",

I broke it by violating some pretty basic React rules, so if you know React you should be able to fix it.For the backend I chose a hackerrank test from the list of available tests. Mostly everyone who has taken it has at least done decently.Only a few people have taken it so far, so I’m really only getting initial data here. About 1/3 of the people have been able to fix the sorting in React. It’s only two files, it’s a fairly small code snippet, and you have about an hour to do the test.The interesting thing is the backend test I chose from hackerrank. It’s a beginner level question, our project is pretty frontend heavy and we are moving a lot of logic to the backend. We need someone strong in frontend who is at least somewhat competent on backend.Since it is an easy question, it tells you to create a class, what to name the methods, and what they need to accept as arguments… then it flags everyone’s answers as plagiarism because they are all exactly the same.",

A lot of companies downsized their recruiting teams or replaced experienced engineers with random “panel volunteers” who have no idea how to evaluate people. It leads to these weird, tone-deaf, or even offensive interviews that test nothing about actual engineering.I’ve had interviewers throw trivia-style questions or ask me to debug something they themselves didn’t understand. The frustrating part is that it feels like they just want to flex rather than collaborate. Good companies use interviews to measure how you think and communicate, not how well you memorize obscure stuff.At this point I treat interviews like noise, one bad experience doesn’t mean you’re not good enough, it just means you hit a broken process. I practiced and interviewed using StealthCoder to focus on explaining my reasoning clearly instead of chasing random trivia. It gives hidden hints and structured solutions so you can focus on communication and problem solving, which is actually what real interviews should value.You’re right, these companies need to fix their process. A lot of great engineers are getting filtered out for nonsense questions while the best hires are the ones who can actually reason and work with others.",

I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. Sorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path.",

When I got out, I had no idea what to do, went through a really bizarre divorce (not related to that transition) and basically sat on my hands for a year and a half. Had to move back in with my parents, it all made me miserable. Finally decided if I wanted to do something worthwhile, I would need a degree. Turns out if you haven't been in school for awhile, its hard to get accepted to a technical program, so did community college for a year, got into a program, didn't really know what I wanted to do, did math, decided CS might be reasonable. Transferred to a different (better engineering school), COVID hit, decided the work I was doing in CS was remarkably boring, did really poorly, felt wayward again. Got transfered to a different program (Civil Engineering), got through the whole program pretty quickly and cleanly, basically could care less about it. Now I am in a Computing applied AI and systems masters program trying to focus on the components I actually enjoy (to varying degrees of success so far). The joy I find in all of this comes in at the edges, and honestly my girlfriend and cooking, the little things I do everyday keep me sane.I say all of this to say its okay to be struggling, its fine to vent and shout into the void, its fine to be tired and disappointed and honestly, in my experience is its also normal to feel like you are doing everything right and still come up feeling like you didn't get anywhere. Life is a grind, survival is a grind and if you can set goals and work towards them, that is awesome (and aspirational), but when something doesn't work out, for whatever reason, it doesn't mean you are washed, you aren't done, just time to figure out the next thing.",

Might get a handful of people trying to weasel through on a VPN, but it would at least create a barrier, and I’m sure the HR folks that review the resumes and stuff would appreciate not having to sift through 90 resumes of ineligible applicants just to find the handful of eligible ones interspersed throughout.",

We don't hire externally into senior/staff+ roles -- it's just not possible to have the necessary organizational/product knowledge required to operate at that level until you've been at the company at least a year or two. You're also not getting promoted to \"senior\" without:* Demonstrated track record of owning complex technical delivery from start to finish. You worked with one or more product teams and drove the bulk of the high level technical decisions for those teams, and shipped many successful products/features while working with those teams.* You have successfully mentored multiple junior engineers and new members of the team up to autonomy.* You have been responsible for fixing time-sensitive regressions, or responding to incidents, and are recognized by the incident team or release management for exceptional work.For any of our Software Engineer promotions, your manager needs to go stand in front of all the other managers in the horizontal/vertical who have Software Engineers and explain why the specific person they are promoting should be promoted. It's an opportunity for every other manager, who will on occasion need to explain to one or more of their reports why they ***weren't*** promoted, to call bullshit.

We have senior people who have been here 10+ years and have no interest in matriculating to a staff+ position.

More like, you have these traits/habits that combined with your skill, you're clearly a Senior.One of my previous teams, there was like 6-8 of us mostly mid-sr. One of the devs had been there 3ish yrs, maybe her second job, I was surprised to find out she wasn't Sr - because of the sense i got from how she operates. But she got promoted maybe after my first month there. There was one official Senior on that team already that was clearly outdoing everyone on the team. It wasn't a competitive thing, it was more like \"goddamn how did you do all of that?\".And IMO usually the Seniors have these traits:* mentioned above, they're always exceeding expectations* they can take ambiguity and figure it out and get it done* instead of asking to do something, they just do it* the don't have to be asked to mentor someonethat last bullet has a bit of a blurry line, some companies will make it a point for a Senior to be assigned to someone for mentorship. That being said, people are gonna come to you for guidance, you shouldn't deny that because you're not officially their mentor",

If that's just what you do normally and don't really have a story that applies, then that's just how it is, should you make something up?Now that I think of it, a similar question that i've been asked is like, 'how do u handle a difficult coworker, or disagreement with a coworker'. Fortunately, in my career, those moments are few and far between. And that's what I express - but i still have to come up with something, i just have to tap into some really really old examples. My response is usually \"you know, i've actually been fortunate enough to work with engineers that collaborate very well together and so i can't tell you a definitive situation recently where our disagreement on xyz was so strong.\" And so i give maybe an old story and how i generally work it out, and really if things escalate to where it gets out of hand, that's what our manager is there for.",

For Atlassian, do you at least still get hired into a craft (BE/FE/FS) or did they get rid of that? They have plenty of fully-BE and platform work (mostly Java/Kotlin or Go), but I don't know whether as a new grad you'd be able to steer you assignment towards it under the new system.TBH, I'd probably go for Bloomberg between those two because if you're willing to commute from Queens or a non-hipster part of Brooklyn. As long as you're not trying to get an apartment Manhattan or a total spillover area, you can live a LOT better on $190k in NYC than you can for $175k in the Bay Area - SF and Manhattan are both ridiculously expensive, but rents in livable parts of NYC fall off in price a lot quicker than the Bay Area does, and you don't need to have the expense of a car.Edit to add: what is the Bloomberg comp breakdown? Atlassian will be cash + stock + bonus (for new grads, both end-of-year and starting) while Bloomberg is not public. That means Bloomberg is a more cash-heavy than Atlassian, right? That can be a good or a bad thing depending on how much you see the upside in equity comp. Personally, I'd choose the cash.",

I suspect your path to promotion is much slower in finance adjacent (at least, that's been my experience).

I barely write any code, the occasional automation, but it’s mostly yaml config type stuff. Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school. As others have said, it’s something people usually choose to get into later in their career, it assumes a lot of underlying knowledge, it’s high stakes, and it’s not the type of work everybody enjoys or excels at. I know the job market is hard and you take what you can get, but I’d definitely try to get on a different team, or take the job and immediately continue looking for something new before you get pigeon holed. Don’t let what happened to me happen to you.",

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it. Otherwise you’re in danger of coming up with tests that are meaningless but pass and create false coverage.",

I copied my implementation into Gemini and it spat out a fixed version of the code. was probably 3x the LOC of what i had, not safe and would have been rejected by me if I was the reviewer.I tested it out by copying and pasting it in and rerunning my tests. it worked. I read the code, to understand what it was doing differently. I read the little explainer it output. Then I deleted all the AI code I copied in and restored my original implementation. I then reread what I had. I understood my mistake. I modified a single line to return a reference instead of a copied value and it worked.oddly enough, I do not find copilot, cursor, codex, claude, opencode or any other tool \"better\" than using AI like this. to me this is the best way to use it, to get 1 little kernel of \"knowledge\" if it can uncover it and then discard everything and make the change myself. i find all I want from AI is \"what am I missing in my understanding\" not \"give me the solution with me having zero understanding\"",

Not sure what kind of startups you guys are joining, but I’ve worked at startups in pre series A funding, series B funding, and I’m about to join one at series E. The companies in the earlier rounds were an absolute goldmine for learning opportunities. At smaller startups, you typically have to wear many hats, if you can’t do a little bit of everything and be flexible in your work then you’re not as valuable. They’re also a fun, exciting, and different work environment than large companies. There are a lot of desirable reasons to work at a startup. I’ve also worked at large companies (30,000+ employees) and my experiences there were largely terrible in comparison to the startup life. I always really enjoy going into work at startups, you make really close connections and you build cool stuff. It’s very fulfilling and rewarding and you don’t feel like a cog in the machine. That being said, I’ve been laid off twice due to companies going under. There are many reasons to join a startup - stability is not one of them. Just my 2c.",

They proceeded to do a few more funding rounds that changed our valuation of $8B -> $9B -> $17B -> $24B -> $39B in the course of about a year due to the pandemic. Then they hired a few finance people that would help us IPO and we started to realize what our actual valuation was as we did 409a’s (I think that’s what they were called? Idk, someone correct me…) which were basically outside companies estimating valuations. Our value went on the path of $39B -> $35B -> $29B -> …. All the way down to $8B. Then we IPO’d at $10B and by the time we could sell shares it was around $9B.When I joined I got a promotion (SWE -> Senior SWE), then got promoted to their Senior SWE II, then promoted to manager. I ended up making roughly market value for the Bay Area which felt crazy considering I joined a company that went public and at the time of IPO I had been at the company longer than like 75% of the company. Happy to have reached a liquidity event, but would have made more money if I had joined big tech. Also I got taxed at a higher rate because my 3.5 years of stock got taxed as if I made it in one year.It was way more fun than big tech though. Our companies Blind account was sooooo entertaining.

Use it or lose it. Here's what sucks. The longer I sit in this leadership role, the harder it is for me to escape, b/c my coding skills dull and and the industry is rapidly progressing.I haven't picked a path yet. I'm riding it out while the market is trash. I'm compensating by working longer hours so I can study either before or after work, just to keep my skills sharp.As much as I love programming, management is becoming more appealing simply because I think it would be easier at this point.

But she even discouraged me from taking a week of PTO for a once in a lifetime professional opportunity. (I don’t want to dox myself, but I was part of a professional organization in my spare time, who provided the opportunity. So it was “personal” and not directly job-related, but job-adjacent, and would have been a unique experience that probably less than 1,000 people in the country have had. I wasn’t in CS at the time). I deeply regret not pushing it. It’s honestly one of my biggest life regrets.I’ll never work a job again where there is any response to a PTO request other than “yes”. Obviously, I give adequate notice and am ok with working together to ensure there’s coverage over holidays etc. But this whole attitude toward PTO is a huge red flag for me.Maybe you’re a bit stuck for the moment, but I’d be looking to leave ASAP.",

There are some highly competitive companies that run full remote but for the most part if you can be remote, you can be offshored is the company guidance nowadays imo.That being said, maybe survey some higher level courses to see if it would potentially put you off.

The reason I say this is because most companies are bringing back RTO, and in this market you’ll be lucky to find a job at all. There are a ton of layoffs, and the first targets are always older people with less experience (which you will be if you start school now).Salaries are dropping across the board unless you’re a top top prospect (which 99% of us aren’t)If I were you, I would look into nursing (travel nursing pays really well), Teaching, or some kind of government position.I also don’t think you should feel bad at all, it sounds like you got to enjoy your early 20’s - theres a lot of people who didn’t do that AND are unemployed",

My previous employer ended WFH 4 years ago and gave every software developer 90 days to report to the office 4 days a week or take a severance package.Fully remote still exists but the trend is pushing back and, given CS overcrowding, remote jobs are going to get mass applicants.>My true passion is travel, and I figured if I studied CS I could get a well paying job and potentially be able to work remotely whilst traveling in the future.I have never been allowed to take a work computer outside the 50 US states.

There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/There are also tech roles that are don’t require coding. But those are also very competitive, partially driven by a lower number of positions.",

Building things with words and watching the computer spring to life to do your bidding is magical, in a sense. Not enjoying that basic part early on says your tolerance for it might be too low for an industry that prides itself on burnout.However! There are a lot of cushy, well paying jobs in literally every field. And, in most of these jobs, you will find that having a working knowledge of scripting, data manipulation, and basic structures can give you a MASSIVE advantage.My advice: find something you want to do. You’re 26. I’m sure you at least have interests that could point you toward something career wise.Love travel? Become a photographer or something that lets you utilize it. Use scripting to manage your catalogs more efficiently, making your website and portfolio presence stand out more with some web development, etc.I started out loving coding.Then, over the years, I started loving it less.Then it went to apathy.Now I actively dislike it.This was only after ten years. I wish I had gotten my creative writing degree and done what I wanted with my life instead of chasing money.TL;DR: the industry sucks right now. It’s not the slam dunk it was five years ago. If you already don’t like it, maybe give it another six months to a year, but just bail. Do something else. Get a degree in something you want to do, or even a business degree and start your own company doing what you want to do. So many options. CS is not always the best.",

I'd originally planned to have it do bar graphs, pie graphs and line graphs but ran out of space on my floppy disk and had to make a copy of the project and do the pie graphs on another floppy. I wrote some rather cheesy input routines to input the data and drew the graphs using the Apple Pascal Turtle Graphics library that came on the floppy disk. By the time I was done I was bumping up on memory limits so badly I had to swap the keyboard routines out to disk. So every time you hit a key, the floppy drive would flash briefly.Only good thing about that year in school, the project probably kept me from going insane. Everyone was quite impressed with it -- most of the rest of the class opted to do something like Tic Tac Toe in Basic or Fortran. I'd opted to take a couple of programming classes over the summer by that point and could see the difference that they made. Wish I'd kept a print-out of the source, I'd probably get a laugh out of how bad my code was back then. But you know, we all start from pretty much the same place, so I wouldn't be ashamed of it. It'd just make me realize just how far I've come.",

Azure is _more_ than thriving.Second, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",

This may not be the case for a company going through layoffs which may also not even be corrected by said layoffs.Culture will be better. Stability of position may \"feel\" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it. The people will appear more at ease and will usually be more pleasant to work with.Management will probably have a better vision and plan to steer the company. With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.So basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place. If you were even able to get an opening at these companies, would you even want to work there? Maybe, but unlike a share of a company you purchase you have to live that work every day and suffer from the environment for your livelihood's sake:Source: survived several major layoffs at medium co for the last several years.",

Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more \"efficient\", which actually means \"overwork the shit out of people\"3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market. Not always, but often.",

They may understand what the code is doing, but never understand why AI decided on its approach. So if asked how to solve the same problem, even at a high level, these people generally cant come up with an answer.This results in a lot of suboptimal code as the developer settles for \"it works\" because they dont know how good code should look like. Right now AI is decently good, but in my experience, the more you have to keep re-prompting for changes, the worse and worse it gets. So not having a clear direction for what something should look like before engaging AI can sometimes lead to horrible code as you don't know how to course correct because you dont even know what the course is.As a new junior developer, your work is probably very simple and things that AI can handle really really well. But as you progress in your career and tackle more complex issues that AI just isnt good enough at yet, you will need to have critical thinking and problem solving skills that I think you are not developing because you are so reliant on AI.This ended up being a bit of a soap box for me, but tldr: solve the problem on your own and use AI as a faster typing interface so you can develop your problem solving skills better.",

So, if you want to know the reality - get your hands dirty. Be real. Figure it out - and stop listening to the hordes of people generalizing everything. Get together with some humans and talk about the field and the career and see if it's a direction you're willing to spend some serious time exploring - or pick something else.",

I'm not sure why people think software engineering would be any different.>I just want to understand the reality of things before I startHere's my free advice for you: start teaching yourself how to code first. Do it as much as you can. See if you like it. If you think it's cool and you enjoy it (despite it being confusing and difficult at first), then enroll in some CS courses and see if you like the coursework. If you do, then jump into a full-time CS degree program, and try to do at least one internship while you're enrolled. Once you graduate, based on how well you did in school and the quality of your resume, you just might end up with a job after graduation.On the other hand, if the *only* thing drawing you to this field is the potential payday, then things might not look as good for you. The sheer competitiveness means people who enjoy this stuff are going to have a leg up since they're more likely to excel and stand out.",

Base salary increase is nice, but make sure there are stock options available for you at the new place because that is your incentive to make the place a success.Bottom line, the major advantage of an established company over a startup is that established companies can offer more stability (less likely to miss payroll, less likely to close up shop entirely, etc).

Effectively, what this means is that you either need a lead to sign-off on an exception (pretty easy to get), or that when you change the legacy functions, you must add enough test coverage to \"prove\" that it works.Otherwise, the scanners because just another step to the compiler.

In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet. I have zero regrets about the transition in because of what I gained financially. I may try to transfer into a SWE role once I’m able to though.",

They're likely going to want end the interview feeling that you can competently architect and implement solutions on Azure. And if you've done this on AWS, chances are you won't struggle with Azure. But you'll need to sell the interviewers on this.Differences in the major services across AWS/Azure seems reasonable. S3 vs Blob / EC2 vs Azure VMs (and all of the sysops stuff orbiting both) / Glue vs Fabric -- you get the picture. So you can confidently address things like \"well, we did it this way with Glue at current employer for these reasons, but my understanding is Fabric handles X Y Z differently, so we would adjust the approach in A B C ways for D E F reasons if we were to reimplement\".> Postgres * MVCC * Complex and composite data types * JSONB * Object relationsIn my experience this is all pretty surface-level stuff that practically any RDBMS would force you to learn if you're building anything moderately complex with it.

        "body": "7 YOE here.I am a BE generalist who due to the fluidity of the market also do full stack (BE focused).Personally, life just... more or less led me to be a BE/full stack-ish generalist. It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\\_job\\_search\\_2\\_month\\_long\\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs. So you do get screwed in job searches as a pure generalist.Keep in mind specialist in some outdated garbage is the worst of all worlds.",

That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it. I want the experience that comes with it. Diversity of experience is very good.Long story short, I vote for doubling-down, but occasionally pivoting.",

The company had basically been chasing the language they thought to be most popular among devs and also handle large numbers of users. I personally think if you feel confident enough learning it, and intrigued with the features/use cases, it should be well worth your while. I have since interviewed for a few companies that were headhunting for experience in Go, and I will say I've had more inquiries from recruiters because they noticed that experience on LinkedIn over my more extensive experience with JavaScript and Ruby. As I'm sure you've noticed, the more programming you do the easier it becomes to pick up new languages. Python will be but a breeze after Go. TLDR; yes, it has stood out to me as a very lucrative language if you have the time/bandwidth to learn it.",

I have worked with consultants who were smart and have gone on to work for big tech so it depends on each individual career trajectory. But most end up being master of none as they move between projects. It takes years to develop expertise in any tech stack working on a specific problems, say develop a delivery app. Increase the $$$ to attract the right candidate and filter accordingly.",

What happens is they place you with clients that are \"easier\" and can be satisfied by a consultant consistently missing deadlines or one that isn't acclimated to being on the bleeding edge of technology. Because of this there's a sorta schism in the talent pool for consulting. My advice is to really read into their resume and figure out if it's fluff (it usually is). During the first round, be sure to pay close attention to how they talk about previous work. This won't solve all of your problems, but I do hope it provides some clarity to the quality of candidates you get.",

When AI can build Enterprise scale apps that link multiple APIs, funnel the data through an AWS EC2 cluster and not break any security or privacy rules along the way, almost every job on the planet is on the chopping block and either we implement some sort of UBI/Work Guarantee, there will be serious social disorder and whether or not you can get paid to code will be the least of your worries.Don't worry about what is coming, except to stay up to date and learn any new tool you can, like the AI. It's not going to wipe out coding, but it can help one developer move far faster in many tasks, so it will increase productivity and we'd all be smart to learn how to use it and how not to. Like don't copy and paste its code as it makes mistakes a lot, preferably don't use it to write code at all unless it's boilerplate that you are just sick of writing each time (unit tests for example), it's patterns aren't always correct and if you use it to write code, then that code doesn't work, good luck. But do ask it for things that are unchanging, like design patterns, DSA, common established patterns for popular frameworks, etc. Use it like you would a senior at work, you don't have them do your work for you, you ask them for help and, hopefully, they point you in the right direction.",

AI is scary sure, but I'm more scared of the AI bubble popping taking down the rest of the economy with it.Best thing you can do in your position is do the best with the information you have. If you truly love software, stay in it. That will show through. It'll be tough to get seen, but once you do your passion will stand out.

No one will look at a GitHub you list on your resume that could easily be plagiarized. HR doesn't code. Can code on your own if you want to learn tech stacks but no need to polish for sharing.You're seeking entry level work. You just have to know the basics. Most of CS is work experience. Your #1 goal is to get an internship in any part of CS. Oh you know this. If you don't, your odds of having a job at graduation tank. You're competitive applying in your 3rd semester for the upcoming summer.An AI job is not an impossibility with work experience but the real AI work requires graduate school education. Can be in CS or Electrical or Computer Engineering. Entry level job might masquerade it's AI to bait and switch you. Oh you can use GitHub Copilot, big whoop.University prestige is very important for consideration of internships and entry level jobs, then maybe never matters again. If you're US, I call Tier 1 a Top 40 or 50 program or #1 or #2 in your state. If you're at shit tier, you need to transfer up. You're not going to have 200+ companies recruiting on campus for CS and engineering students and HR is more likely to not read your resume.For now, make good grades, apply yourself and pursue what you're passionate about, whether in CS or not. Recruiters like seeing passion. I was into camping and hiking. Hackathons are a decent use of your time. Working with others is a valuable skill, both in general and to recruiters.",

Personally i think the only way to get a master's is if you got it for cheap (i.e. a job paid for it, or you got a lot of scholarships). Basically if you need to take a financial hit to take it, it's not wroth it because you wont really see much of an immediate upside iwth it. I think in your case, it does makes ense to go for it. You can get it in a year, and even if you got loans it's not going to be enough that once you land a job you couldnt pay in a year or so.",

        "body": "Personally I would say stay at your school if you’re going to finish faster. Really unless you’re at a school that no one has heard of you’re going to be fine. Especially applying for full time positions, a single internship with relevant experience to what you’ll be doing in the position you’re applying for is worth WAY more than a degree from like CMU, MIT, Stanford, GT, etc. That said, these places might get you better connections, but at the end of the day you can make up having a less prestigious school in your resume by having strong projects and or internship and co-op experience. Also once you get your first real position, no employer really cares about what school you went to or what your GPA is. If you’re interested in graphics programming, I would start with picking up a book on OpenGL and actually building stuff. Possibly using something like Open3D. As for if you should get your Masters, I would look now at the types of jobs you would like to apply for after you finish school. If most of them require a master’s degree, then yeah get it now. Speaking from experience it’s way easier to get it straight away than trying to go back. I tried after i started working full time and my wife and I had just started a family and finishing my masters program was more than I can handle. So if you think you might want to and you have the means to do it, I would say do it now while your brain is still in “school mode” and you don’t have a bunch of other extra responsibilities to balance. The other alternative is to get in somewhere that will pay for your master’s, but that seems to be increasingly rare nowadays.",

I did the thesis option and my research project was pretty much an implementation of existing research. I was paying out of pocket though so I couldn't afford to stay longer than a year. If you can only stay a year I would do the exam option in which you need to take a final assessment instead of doing research. My friend did the exam option for his master's and he found employment rather quickly whereas I'm still struggling to find a full time job.",
