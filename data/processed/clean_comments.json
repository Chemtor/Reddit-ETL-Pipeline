Was it due to low effort resumes?The 21 who got a phone screen, did they all have the exact tech stack you were looking for? With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.You had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen. I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based. So I can understand why 9 failed.You then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge. I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials. Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.But then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review. I find that odd that so many failed. Was it an experience issue with the tech stack. Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?Anything you would have wished gone different? I find the funnel here to be very lopsided. Do you think it would have been better to start with more than the 21 initial candidates?",

That’s rare.* **Zero-Copy + Arrow Interop**: Shares memory with Arrow without copying — great for performance.* **Pushdown Compute on Compressed Data**: If supported, this is huge — filter/compute without decompressing.* **Forward-Compatible WASM Decompression**: You can ship a new encoding + its logic *inside* the file.* **Handles Ultra-Wide Tables**: O(1) access to 100k+ columns using FlatBuffers.# :cross_mark: What It Gets Wrong (or Needs Work)* **Still immature**: Tooling is limited. No wide adoption (e.g., no Spark/Presto/DuckDB support).* **Too complex for most**: Great for low-level devs, but not plug-and-play for typical data teams.* **IPC Format = WIP**: This is critical for streaming/cloud-native workflows — and it’s not finished.* **Limited language support**: Rust and Python are solid; Java/Go/Scala? Not there yet.* **No benchmarks vs Parquet/Arrow**: Claims are strong, but I want charts.# :balance_scale: Bottom LineVortex is **not** a Parquet replacement (yet), but it’s potentially **better** in specialized cases — like in-browser data tools, embedded systems, or custom DB engines.If you love performance and control, it’s worth watching.

In terms of getting hands on \"big data\", more difficult but not impossible. There are tons of open datasets that you can practice using Spark on. Check on Kaggle, lichess, Google Big query sample data (for this one you cna get Google credits then write out these large datasets to parquet then you are good).I have to say that Spark was quite intimidating when I started around 6y ago but there are a lot of good materials out there.Edit: you will require basic sql knowledge but I would learn this via Spark APIs eg.

The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.Also, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.If you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.You can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.For a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely. The books by Kimball on data warehousing are one of such \"bibles\".Lastly, you can consider proper schools. In my country, there are short courses by local polytechnics and universities for undergrads and post-grads, with substantial government subsidies on the course fees.",

If every build vs buy decision is automatically \"buy\" because the team doesn't have the ability to build, then you are going to end up with a complicated mess of integrations, configurations, and impedance mismatches between systems without clear boundaries of responsibilities.

Sure you can argue that the \"medallion architecture\" is just marketing crap rebranding an idea that's been in use for decades, but pre-aggregated data serves a vital purpose when you're serving data to analysts. Just off the top of my head:- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development. Do you really want them running a monster query with tons of joins repeatedly when you could just save compute by pre-aggregating the data for them?",

It still has millions and billions of rows, if you let business users or data analysts build aggregations and derive kpi's from it, then you'll end up with massive inconsistencies. I have also noticed where multiple teams interpret metrics in different way and that's an issue. Let's say, \"active customers\" which can have different meaning to different people.  Data is still normalized to certain extent in silver. It's really at gold layer where data is demoralized for fact tables. That's where you could take huge advantage of partitioning and clustering based on low cardinality fields like date.",

But this isn’t the big problem the author thinks it is. At my company, we treat both silver and gold as consumer-facing data marts. Silver is the atomic “business objects” (equivalent to fact/dim, but without the star schema). Then we have gold models for some pre-calculated/filtered/aggregated datasets, always using silver models. There’s really nothing wrong with this kind of structure and people who get all annoyed about “medallion” are just whining and straw-manning the topic to death.",

You need experience as the end consumer of a data stack (or lack thereof), have some comfort with software engineering as opposed to simply \"knowing how to code\", and put in the work to learn how to build and maintain the plumbing that enables data to make its journey from source to business value. This last part takes years of work.The most common story I see (and mine is more or less the same): STEM major works as DS/DA/BI analytics/similar position. Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build. From this point you become a DE in a few months, by definition.I suggest you *don't* look for DE positions. Look for any other job as a data practitioner, and try to slowly move upstream on the data stack from there. It really does take years.",

You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an \"expert\".

You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you find *no* gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.>You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the hill—for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it afterward.Mark Twain, \"Roughing It\"About sums it up.

And the latter is sometimes difficult because although every manager loves the idea of pay-per-use, they soon find out they actually have to pay for what they use, while in the old system they did not have that dynamic. Given the amount of overhead of running something yourself, I would definitely not rule out Snowflake. It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.What I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer. We are eying that currently, and I think we will save around 50% on our Snowflake bill.",

Its like people who really know DBs sat down and thought \"Lets take all the best bits we've seen, make the ugly bits pretty and easy to use. Lets minimise management\". I'm a huge fan of it, even considering the hands on experience I have with alternatives.Cost wise, it really is pay for use. Basic common sense applies.Cost monitoring should be a priority. Dashboards that autorefresh frequently when they don't need to must be hunted down and shot.People who use SELECT * need reeducating again....and again. It is possible to block its use with a row policy but that can cause more problems than it is worth .One thing that shocks me with clients is that if they have budgetted X, with a bit of leeway, then they don't care if it costs significantly less. Cost savings don't excite them. Revenue generation does!",

BigQuery gives 10GB of storage and 1TiB of query data processed per month for free. Not just that, in BigQuery you can partition your data on various field and time, which optimizes your query processing to use less resources and manage costs. Big Query's Active storage costs $0.02 per GB which you will be charged around $20 each TB after 1 TB coz first 1TB each month is free. In snowflake it's around $40 and no free storage.And as long as Postgres is concerned, you can use a hybrid in which you can use it for smaller transactional data which you might not want to store for longer period, like logs, sessions, and sometimes historical data, you can use it for quick processing for your SaaS and use Data Warehouse for analytical use cases because as your data will grow Postgres will start to slow down in processing, but data warehouse will be great for processing big data, using this approach will significantly optimize your cost and boost your use case.",

        "body": "This is the wrong way to think about this.Snowflake is a consumption based pricing model. It's not really about the size of your data at all. It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.They give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.It scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.BUTthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \\*and\\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.It's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.So the math is simple:DIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (\"Free!\\*\\*\\*\") + a lot of opex (\"pay people to manage it\") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)PaaS/SaaS is higher capex (\"Snowflake is expensive!\") + very little opex (\"this thing runs itself\") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.So in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.When my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: \"When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.\"PS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price. Don't think of it as \"needlessly\" expensive - think of it as \"am I going to use it in a way to deliver the value I'm trying to pay for?\"",

You’re looking at ~50 dollars per month for pure storage costs (could be even less due to compression when moving to columnar storage). The rest is compute, so that’s hard to estimate, but I don’t think your use cases will be too heavy. I could imagine you end up with a bill of 100-200 dollars per month.For that amount of money, you should save yourself the troubles of self-hosting an open source DWH. Yes, you could end up with a cheaper bill. But you should keep the time you need to invest in deployment, maintenance, security etc into account as well.",

We've seen tons of companies move from exactly your setup (PowerBI + expensive compute that runs 24/7) to ClickHouse and it usually works really well for retail drill-down scenarios (we have a very large retail customer at Tinybird doing exactly that - unfortunately I can't mention them by name).ClickHouse is that is quite literally built for this kind of workload - fast aggregations across massive datasets with arbitrary groupings. Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.A few things to consider though:1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?Druid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.I'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions.

        "body": "Many reasons. Challenges with OBTs include: * Some reporting tools prefer or expect dimensional models * Even with columnar storage there are performance impacts from having a large number of columns, especially high-cardinality, long strings. * If you are keeping raw data so that you can rebuild your OBT, then you already need versioned models, which is the hard part of dimensional modeling, to support rebuilding it. * Without dimension tables getting a consistent cross-tab with all possible dimension values isn't possible. The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values. * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows. * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred. For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year? All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT. * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns * etc, etc, etc, etcFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",

Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head. People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down. This is all part of learning and improving.Second advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do. If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge. People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",

You've already got the job and it sounds like you are producing at a level that is expected/acceptable. Go easy on yourself, and ask lots of questions about how you could improve your submissions, or ask about terms that are unfamiliar. Everyone starts at the beginning, and NOBODY learns EVERYTHING in school. Get to know them and you might find that they have some additional resources for you that are directly relevant to the kind of work you are doing. You may even find out that a few of them struggled in the beginning, just like yourself.If you don't want to get too personal, you could always just ask them directly about some of their favorite resources like books, YouTubers, or podcasts because you want to continue to grow. Also, keep posting here. Everyone wants to help and mentors are hard to find. If you don't already have a daily reader, I highly suggest the Confidence Gap on audible.

Also sign up for a free trial on Snowflake and mess around with it. Learn how you can get data in and query it.

But i'd reccomend doing a bit of a pit stop in analytics engineering first for a year, and then doing the transition from AE to DE.This transition is a lot easier imo as the skill sets are super similar and way more opportunity to get into it right now I think.I commented this on another thread, but I helped two of my friends get analytics engineering roles recently. one was a CS graduate, the other had one year SWE experience - so less than you tbh.To get into AE, the best advice i can give is to read all the dbt docs, do the free dbt course. Then set up dbt core on your own. Connect to whatever db, Google BigQuery is a really easy one to get running and play around putting theory into practice.The AE space is very active right now, at least it is in the UK where I'm from.Good luck dude!!",

Yes, obviously GPUs have become big — if you’re paying any attention to either the tech or finance space you would’ve seen Nvidia dominating with their explosive stock growth (you know, during a gold rush, sell shovels and all that). A much more interesting discussion around this is how the AI boom is basically keeping the (American) economy sustained; how we’re on the verge of data center infrastructure bubble bursting similar to the telecom bubble the late 90s; how we’ll have trouble feeding electricity to all these new data centers and how electricity prices will continue go up because of that and because policy makers are putting the brakes on renewables; how all this new AI tech is amounting to little more low quality slop being generated at an unprecedented rate and we’re essentially stuck with it forever. Yes, I know these technically different topics but I find them much more relevant and the educated discussions around them much more insightful.This article is just about shifting more computing resources to hardware designed for matrix multiplications… like, yea no shit. The title is clickbait, the content is feeble, and the whole premise is weak. Regular CS fundamentals are not going anywhere and will always be a core element of computing. I find Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy’s statements around this much more interesting — that with each paradigm shift, the makeup of software (and hence hardware) just shifts. I get that this article is essentially saying that, but there just isn’t much there besides the obvious.",

If you try to get a bachelor's degree that is online at the cheapest, easiest school you can find, you may be able to avoid this by simply being able to check that box.",

I've almost always seen some version of number 1. But letting users \"blue sky\" things can be troublesome no matter what. I usually try and anchor the conversation in tangible reality: \"How are you getting the data now? Is there a native report inside the tool? Have you used something in the past that delivered this? What was it?\" If there's something that already exists that can serve as a starting point and provide a common understanding that can greatly ease the process.

Version 3 has been realised in this year and as I know need few updates to work correctly. I think it will be easier to start with version 2.xx.BI: Python Stremlit - very easy to build nice looking chartsVersion control: git of course, and github with github actions. And my recommendation for future is to buy computer for homelab and try proxmox to create different VM and set different services on each.On local computer is easier because everything works on localhost so you don't have to worried about networks.I suggest to use docker. It much easier and I guess you want to focus on data processing instead of devops thing.",

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).If you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.If, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.Pay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.----tl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself. You've never worked in this field, it's not appropriate to have expectations. Become a student again. Focus on learning the needs of the role, not on yourself / your self-doubt / your perception of yourself.",

If I was to change company salary expectations would be a clear issue as I can’t afford to go any lower than what I am on now £90k as reference.But you’re right. I can write code and build something simple, but the rest, where you mention my GitHub repo I agree 100% but for me that’s the learning journey too. I would also say because of my imposter syndrome I am very humble with my skill set and what I can and can’t do. I will never be someone who is will say they can do it if I’m not 100% comfortable",

Interview hiring managers, explain your intention in your career path for the future, ask what technologies they're hiring for.Identify 2 or 3 real, long-term careers that way (one technology = not a career), learn only that specific thing/career (nothing else matters), maybe get certified for it (optional), and interview for junior/medior positions while being honest about your career path and skills.Learn only what matters for that specific position. Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.Find yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.I would say \"that's it\", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.But the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",

The shift toward treating data infrastructure more like software has been one of the biggest changes I've seen over the past few years.I think the \"data is too messy\" argument is kinda missing the point though. Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.The schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general \"data as code\" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.The local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.I guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges. Like CI/CD for data pipelines needs to handle things like data quality checks, schema validation, backfill strategies etc that traditional software CI/CD doesn't really deal with.",

Log-based CDC solves that but yeah, the tooling is mostly built for full-on streaming pipelines, not lightweight batch.There's a couple open-source options like `mysqlbinlog` or libraries like `go-mysql` and `maxwell`, but they’re super low-level. You end up writing a lot of glue code just to get something usable. Some folks hack together scripts that tail binlogs, write them to disk, and then batch-load into analytics systems, but that’s pretty fragile long-term.Are you pushing this into a warehouse? How often do you need fresh data? And how complex are your schemas (lots of deletes/updates or mostly inserts)?For what it’s worth, I work at Estuary, and we actually do log-based CDC (including MySQL binlogs) but abstract all the hard parts away. It’s more like “click to connect” and you get real-time or batched syncs with very little to manage. Kind of like Fivetran but way more flexible and with a transparent pricing.",

Keeping all that infra running just to read binlogs in a small team setting didn’t feel worth it.One project I recently came across that sits right in this middle ground is OLake. Instead of going full streaming, it can just read from MySQL/Postgres logs in a more batch or micro batch oriented way - like you schedule a sync job with Airflow or cron or they even have temporal integrated in their UI offering, and it picks up exactly what changed. No \"updated\\_at\" hacks, no Kafka clusters.Couple of things I liked about it:* It talks to the binlogs directly, so correctness is better than column-based filtering.* You can still run it in “batch or micro-batch” mode, so you don’t have to keep another service always-on.* It writes data straight to open formats like Iceberg or simple parquets in object store, so downstream analytics feels natural.It’s open source and lightweight (basically a Docker container you can run anywhere), so might be worth a peek if you’re looking for that sweet spot between *timestamp columns* and *full streaming infra*.Repo here if you want to poke around → [https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake)",

Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.I personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. The medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. You architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. With that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. One last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",

        "body": "I'm not sure where the confusion is. We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.That's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.Maybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.As far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.That being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.However, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like \"I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?\" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.For example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.Having said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as \"bronze\" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.For your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an \"analytics\" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",

The simplest approach without knowing your tooling, level of effort available, number of users/pipelines/reports would be to create a report that keys off a table holding runtime information for your different data pipelines.An easier way would be to have the dataset name (meaningful to the analysts), the runtime datetime, expected interval, and is_stale flag set to 0 or 1 if the last updated + interval is greater than the current datetime. You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. If analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale. This will depend on your analysts tooling though and if they’re viewing raw data, using bi tools, etc. You could also use something as simple as an email group with email notifications when pipelines fail. I don’t recommend this personally, but it might be quick if you need this done fast.",

I would ask a candidate 1) what is the software engineering concept not being followed that is causing this mess (my answer: lack of DRY models and not having one purpose per model) 2) How would you go about fixing this? (my answer: start with a model used for BI consumption, understand its source tables and columns, check column level lineage for each column, come up with a plan to consolidate intermediate models after understanding each column calculation) 3) How do you prevent this in the future? (My answer: create a strong culture of preplanning and peer review, alerting based on some measure of DAG messiness in the CI pipeline)Going from “I just know general dbt concepts and execute them” to “I can make your data ecosystem stronger with my dbt skills and promote of a culture of engineering excellence” will take you way further.",

And if they ask questions you don't know the answers to, well, you've learned about a gap in your skillset and you can go learn more on that topic. At the end of the day, dbt is just a really nice way to structure and test SQL using some tools borrowed from software engineering. Knowing the fundamentals of data management (which I assume you do after 20yrs) is still like 95% of the job. The \"years of experience\" aren't necessarily about dbt specifically, they're about asking for a certain skill level / ability to perform. Realistically, you should try to apply for any job where you meet about 75% of the requirements. *Especially* if you have relevant experience in related areas on the stuff you're technically missing.

Let's say TBL A has 100m rows for same prim\\_key you are joining on, and TBL B has let's say 1000 rows for the same prim\\_key, now when you are doing joins, the result is 100m \\* 1000 rows in single core/executor. Now let's say you introduced a new key with salt factor of 100 for eg. You pick the smaller table and do cross join and create 1000 \\* 100 rows for TBL B, you add a new col in TBL A and 100m will be divided by 100 for each salt key resulting in 1m rows per each salt key. Now when you perform join, your executor is effectively processing still 1000 from B, 1m rows from TBL A --> final count per core / executor --> 1000 \\* 1m.You can do the math for two large tbls, the only consideration is the table which is going to have smaller rows should be choosen for cross join candidate, and your executor should have enough memory to handle this data skew in the first place. I'll let others pitchin for above two large tbl joins.",

Therefore we also have a third one, which is a subset of the snapshot but only with active users, so we can maybe get it down to 30% of the size.So in joins - we join on the date and userid with the transactional and then use the snapshot (with active users) as a fallback on date -1 if there were no changes on the day we process.This has reduced the data scanned massively and also improved performance in all measures.Edit: typos",

For example the NFL starts next week, you could scrape fantasy football rankings from multiple sites and calculate each player's average rank (or some other analysis). Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).Then it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.Sports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time. This sort of thing is a common use case for a simple but non-trivial data pipeline.",

If you happen to experience bugs or anything weird please report as a Github issue or in the #dbt-fusion-engine community slack channel2. you're right to call out that the Fusion CLI and VS Code extension are different things, but overlap slightly.3. Forgive me if I get long-winded, I'm a former teacher, so always love a good lecture / teaching opportunity. Please let me know what of my explanation clicks (and what doesn't!)On launch three months ago, we published the blog: [The Components of the dbt Fusion engine and how they fit together](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components). It's worth a full read, but I wanted to paraphrase the section about [the VS Code extension and Language Server](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#the-dbt-vs-code-extension-and-language-server).There's actually 3 components worth calling out:1. The Fusion CLI binary (basically the equivalent of dbt Core but in Rust)2. The Fusion Language Server binary (a.k.a LSP)3. The VS Code extensionA language server share a great deal of code with the Fusion CLI but it's intended user is not a human in a terminal, but rather an IDE who can talk to it on behalf of the user. When you download or update the VS Code extension you might notice that in the bottom status bar it will say: \"Downloading file\" that's the extension grabbing the latest version of the Language Server from our CDN.In it there's a pretty diagram (made by yours truly) that shows that the VS Code extension has two buckets of features broken out by the binary that powers them1. **by the CLI**: running commands, previewing models2. **by the LSP**: intellisense, lineage, go to reference In a comment >So can I access the enhanced features in fusion without using the extension in another IDE?Theoretically, the Fusion LSP could be made to work with and distributed such that it could work with other IDEs like you say. However, the reality is today that it only works with VS Code and VS Codium-based IDES (i.e. Cursor & Windsurf). If we hear of enough demand for other IDEs (emacs, JetBrains), we'll certainly make it happen there as well.",

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. The other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",

You’re experience in the past that supports this is ABC. You can use the aforementioned example but need a concrete data point how it’s caused problems or slows down the team. Do not bikeshed on it, despite the universal urge to do so that we all feel and can relate to. Then move on and focus on delivering what leadership expects of you.

You highlighted my exact concern, bringing this up in the regular meetings is basically pointing a finger at someone and that's not my intent but right now is the best time to fix this as we just redesigned and I don't know how much is dependent on it yet. Unfortunately the people id have to pull in to answer those questions wouldn't consider it a priority. I took this job to learn about organizing, culture and workflow of larger teams and unfortunately it's been more frustrating than educational. By the time the problems get to the devs it's far too late to do anything about it, I really wish we could have useful design reviews but that was something I was hoping to learn at this job. I know how to do all this on small teams where you just communicate, not so much when trying to essentially automate different teams workloads and getting them to fit together nicely",

Too many cooks.With larger teams it does become more organizational, which is closer to what managers and directors think about. Staff and senior staff engineers normally work with that leadership to carve out projects and scope that meet high level direction. They also take the flak when things are slow, don’t pan out, or aren’t as useful as they expected. Ideally, with good leadership principles, this is transparent to the rest of the team but also not in a way that makes the team feel unsafe. These relationships are built on trust, good examples, work ethic, and competence. But that good leadership is VERY VERY hard to find. Even at big FAANG companies. I’ve only experienced it a couple times in my whole career. Some people never experience it.",

Airbyte’s better on cost, but the managed version still needs care, and self-hosting isn't hands-off at all.Debezium is great when you want full control, but yeah, it needs a ton of infra and Kafka knowledge. Also, some ERP sources (like SAP) can be messy with Debezium or even unsupported directly, so you'd need to extract from a staging DB anyway.What kind of latency are you ok with? And do you have any infra budget or internal support for CI/CD pipelines? Also curious if you're planning to land the data in Delta Lake or use something like Synapse?FWIW, Estuary handles CDC with minimal setup and works well with most of your stack (Oracle, Salesforce, etc), and you don't need to run any infra.

However, I'm planning to have my higher level pipelines write some rows to an ETL status table in the DW DB when they complete successfully. Along with that we'll remove our Power BI web service scheduled refreshes for our models and instead have Power Automate jobs that start at maybe 5:30am and wait for their related rows to exist in that status table, then kick off the model refreshes. The Power Automate jobs would time out by maybe 6:30am. This way if the ETL didn't finish in time for automated analytics emails etc, then those emails will just send with the day-old data and models will wait until the next day (or manually refreshes when I check on it).",

But I'd want to get the DAG correct first.I think you're thinking about it backwards a bit. Whenever a given node in the graph runs (and I'm assuming that we're including source tables in the dag, at least in your mental model), every direct or transitive dependency (which you can find efficiently and without cycles, that's the directed and acyclic parts) is then outdated. That doesn't mean you have to instantly address it, but it does tell you when there's potential work to be done.Looking at it from a \"pull\" perspective is totally valid from a mathematical perspective too, but I think looking at it in terms of what downstream tables aren't up to date may be a bit easier to think through.",

For example, I have a friend who contracts for a big pharma company in a Senior position managing clinical trials. I have looked at day rates for a standard DE role here in the UK. Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.Aside from that, this requires a mindset shift. As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, \"what jobs am I good enough for?\" which eventually devolved to \"will I ever be good enough?\".The cycle is this - you apply for jobs. You get nothing back - you go away and improve your existing code, take another look at your CV/resume, you continue learning. You get something back, your profile and the job market conditions are in the right place. You keep repeating until you get something back.There are no secrets, hacks, or shortcuts.

So I’d say most important is what you bring to the role, good attitude, energy and an openness to learning and developing skills. Like mentioned before, be proactive in understanding how the product or application (s) you are working on really works. Sketch the data pipelines, the tech stack and how they fit in together. Talk to seniors when you have questions. Identify areas that are bottlenecks, have legacy systems and that can be improved. Try not to change large blocks, but find small things you can improve. This will give you confidence to do bigger things. Reading books and doing courses are okay, but you learn most by solving real problems. So always focus on finding problems and solving them.

LLMs underperform by ~10% (best case) compared to conventional document processing / entity extraction / OCR tasks. By LLMs I mean GenAI chat bots. You can use a custom encoding fine tuned on task specific output layers but 99% of the vibe coders don’t know this.2. OCR works great if you use the right OCR. Cloud based OCR APIs from Azure, AWS, Google. All can be set up securely and are 10-100x cheaper than LLMs.3. Find the right tool. Look into successors of LayoutLM specifically built for charts. Though at the end of the day this is a hard problem and most likely an XY question type ask.If this really is the client’s data and they’re not scraping charts from some other data source, why can’t you just recreate the charts with their data? If they are scraping charts from other places, are they able to extract the raw SVG or similar vector format? If you can get the raw vectorized image you can pull out the information manually without AI.",

Read kimball modeling practices and write SQL to make good data models. Get a job as an analyst. Get tight with the people feeding you the data and step into their world. Good luck",

If you are a hard worker and self learner, and you start out by building a project and find your you like it a lot then there is no reason you can’t succeed. All the info and more exists on the web for free. The best thing to do is to think of a personal problem you want to solve (my first project was a web scraper that found upcoming shows for artists I like in my area, I still maintain it 8 years later) — and make it fullish stack. Some backend DB, like Postgres, some python data wrangling, some analytical processes using duck db, and then a UI of some sort for fun like a UI to trigger jobs or view reports. I would suggest pasting the above snippet to chat gpt and asking for a real breakdown starter project template — but then refraining from asking it to do anymore.

You can read Athena tables in Glue because it reads the underlying S3 data, but you cannot write to Athena tables the same way you do in the Athena console. The recommended approach is to perform the transformation and insertion entirely within Glue: first, read the source data from S3 into a Glue DynamicFrame, then apply any necessary transformations using PySpark, and finally write the results back to the target S3 location in the correct format (e.g., Parquet). This way, Glue handles ETL, and Athena is used for querying, avoiding the unsupported pattern of executing Athena queries from Glue.",

If not then maybe this will work for youI learned to distrust Airbytes historical loading along time ago and instead wrap each Airbyte raw table with a dbt snapshot.With this approach you can alter the start date of the api calls (I forget if hubspot has it but I would guess so) and only retrieve a reasonable amount of historical data. The snapshot would allow for merging any changed historical data. I regularly prune out the airbyte raw tables to keep the normalization step from becoming a time bomb. When it tries to unfold the potentially billions of json rows it seems to struggle",

Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. Source connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. Debugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT. It also supports JMX out of the box.The real problem is that many connector plugins are not open source (for example the ones from Confluent), so you have to rely on documentation and forums.",

What you can try to do on your local machine is setup a Postgres or MySQL whatever database, and install confluent Kafka. From there, set up a source connector that reads the latest inserts into a table and into a Kafka topic. And then after that, set up a sink connector to read from that topic and put it in another table. If you want, you can even practice doing some data manipulation in your config files as well. This is just a simple flow for Kafka connect that you can get to work on your own machine. Kafka Connect is simply a json file that you deploy to do all the easy pub and sub for you",

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. I'd recommend looking up some videos which will explain this much better than I can. Take a look at some blog post etc. just generally get a few viewpoints and explanations as to what it is.Generally, you develop code for your application locally and then it runs somewhere else on a schedule. So, you have to get your code over to the location where it runs. The process for most workflows is develop on your machine -> push to a branch/repo -> submit pull request to main -> deploy to where it runs. This is a CI/CD process.To avoid it getting too complicated, your CI/CD process is likely going to be as simple as branching off main -> making changes -> pushing to your remote branch -> pull to main -> auto publishing main -> schedule application via Github actions.This is assuming you're familiar with git and source control. If not, this is a great opportunity to learn.",

That is what has to solve your use-cases, given all the properties you require in your specific circumstances. I can choose a totally different stack and solve other DE problems in my environment. Same DE domain, different stack, both valid. Exactly this is why corporations are susceptible to just go with one of the big platforms. Large community solving solutions with the same tooling on the same platform makes sure that you can get support or hire someone.",

Here are my recommendations:* Prefer Parquet over CSV.* Unload only the needed columns/rows.* Make sure PARALLEL is ON (it’s the default).* If you’re using SSE-KMS, large exports can hit KMS TPS limits.* Put the Redshift subnets on an S3 Gateway VPC endpoint. If traffic goes via a NAT Gateway, it can be a bottleneck (and pricey).* Avoid casts/joins/orderings in the UNLOAD query. Precompute into a temp table, then UNLOAD.",

        "body": "I think it might be a little bit of a misunderstanding to hear different programmers experiences about their work hours and relate that to their efficiency as a programmer. Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.With that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.**Become a master of your debugging tools**Knowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.**Find the true requirements**Don't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.**Code isn't always the answer**To a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.Remember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.**Cut out the distractions**Yeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.**Collaborate**I wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.**Take breaks**After so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well. When you're in a healthy state your brain will function better.",

In my experience, finding client or server side code hard depends mostly on your familiarity with both the technologies being used, and the codebase. Once you become more familiar, they become less hard, whether frontend or backend. The complexity of backends can relate largerly to the distribution of services and their interaction with one another. This requires the ability to store a large, and complex mental model, which can be difficult. Frontends can contain complex physics based animations, or complex state interactions, which also involve having a clear mental model. Either one requires familiarity with the concepts and the codebase. If you are finding backend code harder to understanding, you'll get there. You just need to spend time reading the code, reading the docs, and learning about the technologies, and things will become clearer.

        "body": "It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:When someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their \"first\" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the \"21st\" century even though the year begins with \"20\" and not \"21\". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').In many buildings throughout the world, the \"1\" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's \"nice\" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is \"0\" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.(Side note: This \"number of floors offset from the ground\" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).Here is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a \"0\" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a \"1\" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.It might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \\* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the \"group index\" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.The above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \\[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.I'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",

That would be 0b00000000, 0b00000001, and 0b00000010. There's a natural progression there. I think it just made sense to the people making compilers for various programming languages to start with the first available byte value, which is all zeros, which comes out to a decimal zero. I also suspect this is related to the limitations of early systems. Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought \"Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.\" I think starting from the first available byte value, instead of skipping it, appeals to that tradition as much as it's just natural to do.",

What actually keeps you moving is discipline and consistency. Make a schedule, stick to it, and just keep showing up.Here’s the thing: once you stop, it’s surprisingly hard to come back — even if you used to love coding or learning before. That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.Also, a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.All these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong.

You don't need to collect languages. They come and go (from your mind) easily. What does \"finished C\" and \"doing C++\" mean to you? You learn the syntax and semantics of a language to *use* it. If you've put effort into learning some C, you should write some software in it. You'll retain very little unless you do. It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...As for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).In summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C. Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more \"lower level\" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn. Not essential, I believe, but useful. I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.As far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy. Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language. With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system. But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post. I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language. The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C. Sounds like what you're interested in. C++ is not C, but I suspect that you might be able to use C++ for those problems as well and get some similar out of it. Hope that helps.",

Play around, get creative. Goldplate it (which means do extra). This happens in the real world, we refine our code (or iteration).Do PROJECTS. Focus on your Git skills. Learn topics not studied in classes. You have no idea how many new grads we get who don't even now how to merge or what rebase means which leads us to declining them.Work with friends on silly projects. Silly little projects lead to exponential gains as you learn from each other. Do code reviews of each others Labs. Maybe Dave knows something Bob doesn't, so Dave can let Bob know of this and now Bob knows this and he can pass that knowledge onto others. This way you learn of branching, merging, rebasing and the rest to keep your branches up to date with others.You can make friends with your teachers, because guess what? They were just like you. You never know what kind of insight they can give you.Always ask questions. Something doesn't make sense? Who cares if its a silly question, you are PAYING to be there.For reference:When I was in school, I took 7 classes a semester and still practice coding 2-3hrs a night. It seems like a lot, 2-3hrs? \"are you kidding?!\" No. 2-3hrs is so small, you might not even get any code written while you are learning how to, for example: API REST points for a silly CRUD app.My friend group which was roughly \\~7 of us, all code reviewed each other, would hang out in Skype (oh god I'm old) and just do silly little things. We would all work on projects (not all 7 at the same time) and we would knit pick each other, say \"man this is stupid, do it this way\".Not only will you make friends, you are all uplifting each other, and you will all succeed because that group work is more beneficial in skill than working on a Lab in your class.BUT MOST OF ALL?Have fun.

If they see you are active, curious, and want to learn - they will give you more concessions and help than you expect.3.

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.Universities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. I took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.Anyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. I wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language. One of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",

But that's more entertainment. I'm not really learning. Or to be very specific in a domain I already know very well (so I can accept the pace of the video and still have critical thinking).Learning is doing. And watching a video while doing it is impractical because: you should look at one thing at a time and you should define the rhythm of your learning. Unfortunately, videos are imposing their rhythm. Using a text doc allows you to scan fast the content and move around the doc. Focusing on your code, switching when you need. Finding the right information and avoiding the sugar coating that takes ages of your time.When learning coding, you should be doing things. Not watching someone else do something. The solution presented always looks logical. And you feel you learnt something. But you actually just jump over a whole lot of questions in your brain that you don't even know you need to answer. Doing is the way to uncover those questions and fill the gap in your brain. Practice, find doc about what you are practicing, use videos only when you can't find another source that is text.You don't learn to run by watching video of Olympic runners.",

If you want to get a job in the field you'll have to spend a lot of time practicing and self-teaching also, in addition to what you learn in school. Internships are highly recommended.CS is simply an older degree. It's more theoretical and more mathematical than SE, but you still do a lot of coding in both.",

        "body": "\"programming\" has many different areas/typessome are better on windows, some are better on linux, some it makes no difference at allthere are some advantages that come from using the same operating system that the software you are writing will run oneg if you are building something that will be ran as a native app on windows then it will be more convenient to use windows for development tooif you are writing the backend for a website that is expected to run on a linux server, then it will be convenient to use a similar flavour of linux for development (debian / rhel / etc)they are mainly because it will simplify installing dependencies + testing eg as a hypothetical situation, lets say you want to learn PHP to build some dynamic websites, if your server is running ubuntu but your dev machine is running windows, you need to learn how to set up php and your other dependencies first on windows and then again on linux, if you used ubuntu on your dev machine too then you only have to learn once, you are also less likely to run into issues caused by subtle differences between the OS'on flip side lets say you are writing a game in c++ which you want to run natively on windows, but your development machine is running ubuntu, getting the basic window of your game to open up and receive input actually requires OS specific functions, eg for windows there is a \"Win32\" API that you have to call, which is only available on windows, linux does have its own version but then that only works on linux.problem 2 is that DirectX (the main graphics api used by windows + xbox games) is only available on windows, there are cross platform alternatives but that is something to considerall of these problems, and pretty much anything else OS specific, can be solved via virtualisation. eg the php on windows you could use WSL or some other solution to get a linux VM or even better imo use containers (which docker for windows will manage a linux vm for you behind the scenes)the windows game on linux i think there is wine or options for running a windows VM which can allow running windows appspersonally my advice / what i do, if i am building a windows native app i will just use my windows machineif i am building for a linux server or an embedded device i will use a linux VM (i have an Ubuntu 22.04 VM which has most of my projects in)if i am building something as a cross platform app then i use whichever i feel like depending on the project, eg standalone little Java desktop apps i generally use windows, if im building an electron based client for an api ive written i will use linux because most likely that API is set up to run in my linux VMreasons- i use windows as my main/host OS because the apps i want to run on windows are the most performance sensitive + most dependence on the direct hardware eg GPU- i run linux in a VM rather than dual boot/another machine tbh because i found that most convenient, i did use to dual boot on my old laptop but having to close everything and reboot every time i wanted to switch between them was a PITA, with a VM i can have my linux VM on 1 screen and my windows host on the other with shared clipboard between them",

But she said it´s difficult to get them in a position, because there are so many who have the exact same skills.She said tho if she had 1 Cobol Coder she could get him into a position because there are barely people who code Cobol anymore, but many companies still rely on it since they never made the change.The thing I personally do is I look for jobs I wanna apply to in 2 years or 3 years and look at their requirements and especially the languages they require. Then I just go and learn it. In worst case I learned skill that the company I apply to doesn´t need, but is very relevant in their industry and in best case they need that skill.Like dress for the job you wanna get and not for the one you have\\^\\^.Microsoft Learn is my best friend so far xD",

Programming has certainly become a frontier extremely difficult to navigate these days— especially with the advent of AI. The only sure way to learn programming— and take my advice —is to try out open-source programs. When I mean trying out, I don’t mean only to use it, but also to download the source code and compile it yourself. Study the code in a Sensible manner, and augment it, or see how far can possibly augment the code without breaking. Documentation Is very important, but let me tell you an Industrial-secret: \\[nobody, not even the guys who created Assembly-language itself know entirely what they are doing— nobody has the perfect idea atleast\\]. What does this mean? Trial and Error. And only by using this method, can you fully accomplish learning Industrial methods of engineering software. You may have noticed a sinister pattern. There is a broad Inequality in the spectrum of projects covered in courses and tutorials offered on the internet. Even then, they are often too basic and fall behind industrial specifications. Even then, open-source softwares lag somewhat in certain areas, compared to the truly Industrial softwares produced by og Software-devs at the beginning of the Digital Age. This is because— and undeniably so — the best software is hidden behind a pay-wall, and rightly so. So, while dabbling with open-source is an excellent way of updating your learning, it also isn’t enough. But I wouldn’t recommend the ‘Grass-roots’ approach to programing— it’s just impossible. You need vast amount of people-hours to construct even most basic programs. Libraries develop, sure. But they are often by-products of designs intended for specific projects. This, in the end adds up to the inefficiency of the entire system. That is why, companies at-times resort to constructing their projects from as further back as possible— ie. CPU architectures. This is perhaps the best way to increase efficiency. What does this mean for you? It means, that using Libraries aren’t as good as making libraries. To sum up everything I said in a way beneficial to you: begin by using and testing open-source software; don’t become Frustrated knowing that you can’t make a software like ‘TempleOS’. Making an excellent and efficient software is as difficult as building the pyramids. You need large man-hours. Speaking of TempleOS. I am sure even Terry, the creator of TempleOS, understands how he was limited by the hardware— which was obviously impossible even for him. I say that, because people pretend as if it is the most efficient software ever written— it isn’t.",

Building blocks (databases, backend/frontend, infrastructure, integrations, etc.) 2. Ways to put them together (system design)Platforms like freecodecamp mostly teach you syntax of programming languages -- which is less and less valuable in 2025. I don't know of any existing platforms that actually teach system design effectively. I'm wondering if people here can share any recommendations. But I'll share a book you can start with: System Design on AWS, by by Jayanth Kumar and Mandeep Singh. The first 8 chapters are a very decent intro into the foundations of system design (and you can stop there if you're not ready for AWS specifics yet).",

(I joke, I like Rust overall).Once you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).I much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \\*/& etc.) too.Rust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.There are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.TLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while. It can be used to write fast, robust native software. I use ripgrep, fd, every day.",

If your end goal is making games for a console, it's not going to be an issue at all to start in those languages. To directly answer your question, i would advise picking an ergonomic language to let you focus on learning the fundamentals instead of fighting the quirks of the language. Relative to BASIC or assembly, C will feel much easier",

Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique.

        "body": "It can be hard to put these into practice. You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. Your priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.Also, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.So, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.My advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.You can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.There's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.For example, I encountered something similar to the following: code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30Let's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.It would read better as boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) { return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 || taxCode == 30; }Even if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.The other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.If you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.There are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",

For videos:• FreeCodeCamp’s full-stack web tutorials (React + Node)• Sentdex’s Python/AI tutorials on YouTube• Corey Schafer for Python deep dives.You don’t have to “choose perfectly” right now — just follow what excites you most and you’ll naturally pick up skills that transfer across areas.",

You can incorporate these into the next little push you make.I keep a TODO file in the root with every crazy thought I have as I work, roughly split by difficulty and area. When I start in the morning, I pick something trivial off the TODO list to give me a little boost to get me started on something harder.I started off way back in the day making video games, perhaps I'm stuck in that mindset.

The first is to write a test harness that, once it passes, then you know the task is done.Like today I was stuck trying to build this new user story and ended up just making a really long cypress test that setup the environment to where the feature was relevant and walked through all the necessary steps. It failed (of course) but it failed quickly and showed the exact spot where it was failing so I could keep changing something, run the test, change something, run the test until it could run all the way through.I think that solves one cause of this which is constantly trying to remember how to get to the spot where the thing you’re working on pops up.Another cause is when I have to make something that involves several layers of abstraction. For that I like starting on one end and just sprinkling assert statements with detailed messages as I go. That way I don’t end up with a spaghetti mess of code that I’m trying to fix across several files.Hope that helps :)",

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.First start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. After doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know. At that point you'll have some experience and you can look to helping out in larger and larger projects.It's not a fast process, but I've found it rewarding so far.",

And in this space, PHP is still a powerhouse. From WordPress, Magento, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, and countless premium solutions, PHP continues to fuel a massive chunk of the internet.That said, the current tech landscape is evolving. The spotlight today is on scalable, secure frontends, and that’s where JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Knockout dominate. Add to that the industry’s move toward headless architecture and microservices, and you’ll see why frontend innovation is driving a lot of excitement.Meanwhile, Python has carved its own path. Thanks to the AI/ML revolution, it’s become the go-to language for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The beauty? If you know Python, you’re not limited—you can work on AI/ML and build web applications too.In short: PHP isn’t going anywhere, but the battlefield has expanded. The future belongs to those who can adapt across ecosystems—whether that’s PHP, JS frameworks, or Python.",

I will say that generally, to learn and understand something, people need that thing to be connected to their existing understanding of the world. For example, I didn't really \"get\" the quadratic equation until a teacher did a proof of it, so I could see how to get there from what I already knew.The other big way to connect new concepts to existing understanding is through analogy, but different people have different existing knowledge to connect to. For example, most math students wouldn't be helped if you said \"domain is the set of all valid arguments for a pure function, and range is the set of all valid return values\". In your case, though, that may be a useful analogy. So for the function: int.ToString(), the domain is all integers from - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and the range is the set of all strings that match the regex \"\\-?\\d{1,10}\"",

Moreover, when you actually get problems with such complexities at work, you probably won’t be expected to solve them perfectly in under 60 min, without google, without colleagues you can consult.So if the question is whether it’s a good way for you to level up, then my question is which area do you want to level up in? Do you want to level up your Leetcode-esque coding interview skill? Sure. Do you want to level up your programming skills in general?

Good times!It depends what interests you. I started with C++, which was good because it's one of the most popular and well-supported languages there is, but it's relatively hard to get into. That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.Today I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.You can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.Python I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.Definitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",

The youtube channel \"Sebastian Lague\" has a small series about chess programming that is way more approachable than the wiki (but way less explanatory) that is also a great introduction, his code is in C# using the Unity game engine, unity has a lot of resources and is another great option, Godot is also an option. Python and javascript are the two most common \"starting languages\", i personally don't recommend starting from higher level languages as it's much easier to understand additional abstractions learning from low level languages than to unlearn them moving from high level languages, but there's plenty of resources for both, for python the best option would be probably pygame and js can just run directly in the browser. My recommendation would be to stick with lua that you already know, chess programming is not easy and adding learning a whole new language on top would make it way more difficult.",

Express and advanced JS concepts are honestly brutal for beginners, so don't feel bad about struggling with that stuff.For frontend, you're actually in a pretty good spot. Most companies will have designers who create mockups/wireframes for you to implement. You won't usually be designing from scratch unless you're at a tiny startup where everyone wears 10 hats. Your job would be taking those designs and turning them into actual working code.The fact that you've got CSS, HTML and most of JS down is solid. Frontend is way more forgiving when you're learning because you can actually see what you're building instead of staring at terminal outputs all day.At Metana we see students make this exact transition all the time. Backend concepts like databases, server architecture, APIs etc can be overwhelming at first but frontend lets you build confidence with visual feedback. Plus the job market for frontend is pretty decent right now.My advice would be to pick one path and stick with it for now instead of jumping around. If styling feels more natural than wrestling with Express, go frontend. You can always learn backend later once you're comfortable with one side of things. The whole \"full stack\" thing sounds cool but honestly most people end up specializing anyway.Also stop using Mimo and start building actual projects. Certificates don't mean much if you can't show real work in interviews.",

Trying to pull trig and algebra patterns out of your head to solve a calculus riddle is math I don't like. But doing reductions of digital logic circuits using math algorithms was fun for me, and I did better some some people good a traditional math. Solving computer science homework/exam problems was hard for everybody, and I had my moments, but you have to picture in your head where you want to go, write it down in pictures, then you can conjure up the code to get there. Well, at least for me. Sometimes my code was called \"brute force\", but I didn't care, it worked and computers are large and fast these days. Sometimes you have to take \"poetic license\" with the requirements of the problem to solve it. I once had a class problem involving recursion. It said each iteration had to spawn the next using the previous values. The entire class literally had the method spin off another thread, until the computer cried out for mercy. I just sent the values of the output back home to the main, made junk collection destroyed the method and recovered the resources, and created a new one, with the saved values. Yeah, sound obvious to you now. :) The rest of the class thought I cheated. The professor gave me a strange look, and said it was OK, probably because I had the only working solution. Just solve the problem. That means first map out how to get from here to there. The coding actually becomes a bit relaxing until you reach compile time, and moment of truth.",

In this way, it is its own documentation; whenever you're unsure how your system would behave for a given set of inputs, your unit tests should clue you in, either through static analysis or by failing/succeeding.As you point out, having tests gives you a level of security knowing that new changes don't introduce unexpected behaviors.What you say with regards to losing your \"feel\" for the code, that can happen and arguably is a \"feature\" of having excellent test coverage and architecture. If you're soloing a project by yourself, you might not see the immediate benefit. But if you work on an incredibly complex code base with multiple contributors, it's actually a great thing for you not to just rely on your feel. In the \"real world\", imagine you're pulled off a project and someone else takes your place. This person will have no \"feel\" and will rely on test coverage to ensure they're not breaking anything.And finally, from my experience, relying on tests hasn't necessarily diminished my feel for the code. I still know what it does and where it does it, but I have the extra validation that I have the test coverage needed to make changes.",

To a lot of us, the \"everyone else knows more and are better than me, how can I hope to keep up\" is just something our brain does that feels real but isn't, just like visual illusions and lots of other mistakes brains make. The feeling might even be mutual!1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests \"ordinary\" programming. Similarly, I find some languages like JS very hard to reason about because they're so … sloppy, and prefer rather strict languages; but there are plenty of people with the exact opposite preference. Finding out what _your_ preference is is also a key to feeling like you get it.",

I learnt enough to get myself through the door and the rest of it was learning on the job and solving real world problems with real world data. I think it’s great you are looking to be SQL certified but you shouldnt be worried if it has not “clicked” yet.Learn the basics like how to pull data, filter with WHERE, group by for aggregation and then move onto more advanced things like CTE’s , JOINs , window functions and i would say you are 90% there - atleast from an Analyst standpoint.Use this to try and solve problems, there are many websites where you can practice SQL problems with difficulty levels mentioned and if you are able to solve these I think you should consider yourself 90% there.",

How to learn them is solve your problem with your for loop (totally fine) and then resolve it in as many built in methods as you can. This will make you look at what each method does so you should end up learning it with more depth",

Can think of it as loop and replace each element with the result of f.filter -> perform boolean function on each element in the array only keeping those that match the predicate.reduce -> can be used in lots of different ways but commonly I use it as a map and a filter combined so I don't need to do .map and then .filter on the result but you can also use it to take an array to object or other complex data transformations that can't be done via other array functions.There are a bunch of other methods you can use in a library called lodash which you should learn if you can.Also I would recommend using typescript as it holds your hand and makes sure what you are programming is safe.",

It introduces you to all of the basic programming concepts like loops control flow variables while obscuring away explicit memory management or data types. It is also quite good at a lot of data processing work because of the intuitive way it handles lists so there is a big market for python devs. Once you get a decent understanding of programming concepts, then moving onto something like c or c++ may be a better idea because you won’t be fighting to develop a mental model of both high level and low level cs topics at the same time.",

In the second one you ask what a \"beginner\" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.If you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.If you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.If you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.If you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers. Since that wasn't your goal anyway, everything will work out fine.",

I've spent the last year working with it and it's nowhere as simple or intuitive as its exterior suggests. Still, there are jobs that prefer or demand Typescript knowledge, which is just strictly typed Javascript. That means learning about interfaces, generics and type literals, which is nowhere near as hard because I know most of that from Java. The idea I'm getting at is that knowledge of the concepts I learned in Java are helping me now, even though I never use Java. Now change the scenario and let's say I built projects with Java, but had to switch to C or C++. Then I'd be blindsided with memory management and pointers which take a long time to master, and time isn't on your side with so many bills to pay.Languages like Ocaml or Haskell are difficult to learn and I don't see many jobs for them. They are functional programming languages and most languages are OOP or procedural, so I think that these may be best saved for last or skipped entirely.",

But also - possibly starting with c and an arduino or similar would be a good start for a pre-teen - it's a pain, but you can often physically see the outcome of your code (and get an intro to electronics at the same time).

Add in your years of service, and you have more going for you than you think! Keep working hard in your courses and start working on some projects that showcase what you're learning, so you will have a portfolio to display your skills when you enter the job market.

The course on the other hand is more about short scripts to automate daily tasks. Maybe rather consider some classics like the Stanford cs50 course. Or free code camps course on object oriented programming with Python.",

Bear in mind that if you do things like wildcard queries, you will end up scanning the entire \"users\" table on every search.If you care about scaling to large numbers of users, then you'll want to use a full-text search engine that can use an index for efficient searching.I'm not familiar with Prisma, but it seems to be a wrapper around Postgres, and Postgres supports full-text search using the `tsvector` and `tsquery` types. This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.If you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr. This adds a lot of complexity because whenever the data in your DB changes, you have to synchronize those changes to your search index.",

Spotify doesn't make it easy at all to download the audio, it's against their terms of service. And even if you had the audio, automatically determining the chord progression isn't simple or straightforward at all. There may be some advanced AI audio algorithms that try to do it, but I'd expect them to have errors.Honestly the most likely approach would be to fetch the playlist from Spotify, then search for online libraries of lyrics and chords, then try to analyze the chord progression from there. That would be complex but at least plausibly doable. I'm not aware of a centralized database with chord progressions for most songs, but there are plenty of places online that have them in nonstandard formats (often text). Then you'd have to parse various ways to write chords, transpose into the same key to normalize, and count how many are the \"same\".Even determining which is the \"same\" isn't easy. Do you count I, V, vi, IV the same as vi, IV, I, V? What about I, V7, vi, IV? There are lots of chord progressions that are very similar but not identical.",

Programming in general is plenty difficult and while Python is by far the easiest language to initially pick up it still remains hard. C++ on the other hand is like the end boss. It’s verbose, you need to write a lot of lines of code to get things done and it spares you nothing in regards to the difficulty. So yeah you can start with c++, just like some people play dark souls for their first video game. It is possible and will trivialize all other games afterwards if you can make it through, but it’s going to be seriously tough.",

I went to a mid school, so I actually did not get taught programming the best, but by getting AI to teach me how to create things, I now have an app on the App Store (its called GradeGrind if your curious since it helps students succeed in university). I think AI will just reduce the number of jobs, but if you position yourself at the top, then it won't be a problem for you, and you may end up creating something that makes you more money than you would have made in a job anyway :) Good Luck!",

We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.It was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.After about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.After a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.After that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.That was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a \"solutions\" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.Two more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).A few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.If you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up. You can always teach yourself (as I did) but sometimes learning in a formal, structured setting has its benefits.",

The point of software is to build something that works for a business or market problem, all these other languages sacrifice that correctness for being \"easy to learn\" while not admitting that most who learned that language stay stuck as a junior for a long time. So if you want to learn fast, you need fast feedback on what you are doing wrong, and so you want a language like Haskell thats gonna give you that fast feedback. Funny thing is, that once you get past these beginner exercises that you'll do in any language, its easy to move on to advanced haskell where you have 100s of features that dont exist at all in other languages",

For multiplayer, send the text to the server with a Server RPC on the PlayerController, validate length or profanity, then broadcast via the Gamestate or a Multicast so every client updates.To parse commands, check for a leading slash and split the string into a command and arguments, or enable the Regular Expressions plugin if you want pattern matching.Use a RichTextBlock with a DataTable to style names and system messages without custom code.Add simple rate limiting and escape markup so weird input cannot break the UI.If you need references, search for Unreal terms like UMG chat blueprint and replicated chat using PlayerController and GameState, which map directly to this setup hopefully",

See, websites are done with HTML, with the help of CSS to add aesthetics and JavaScript for making them dynamic. But there are frameworks done in Python that has to do with it.An example is Django. It enables you to easily make a web app with python. You make some HTML templates, and install some Database program. Django then runs a web server, which takes the templates you make and fills it with data from the database. It also reads user input and makes it into data that gets stored on the database. How all of that is done is what you do with Python on Django.But as the good ol' saying says: \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". Python **can** do pretty much anything, but that does not mean it is the best for everything.

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. That is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?**Alternate approach**Many others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following* Pick a project* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it* Learn enough about coding while doing the projectWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.However, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.To me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.When someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing. There are things they think are pretty easy, and it's incredibly difficult.However, you'll see more people posting \"do projects\" than the more academic approach.",

A degree or a certificate (a valid certificate like the cyber world has) is another thing that may make paying for a course worth it, but you arent getting that from Udemy or CodeAcademy.Seriously, go check out the thousands of playlists on youtube for free.

You would also need to recalculate all the row maxes and set to the current max you found which seems kind of redundant.Unless you are optimizing for a reason I would just do a two step algorithm where step 1 is find_max where you get a row and column and step 2 is update_row and update_column.

Given the input size your approach seems reasonable, it will work because the max is just the row max and you always make sure to set row max to current.

But, im not all too familiar with design compared to web dev. If you are trying to design AND build them, learn CSS very well, classic styling tool.As for web dev, you should get yourself familiar with the different components, such as frontend (what users see on the webpage), backend (logic for website components), and database (storing data related to website). Also look into different frameworks, which are just groupings of tools and languages for building. Some popular frameworks include react/node, laravel (php based), and spring boot is gaining attention recently i think. With web dev, you also pay attention to different layers such as optimization, memory consumption, so if you're into optimizing processes, this could be a good path for you too.Personally, I like web dev over web design, although it's nice to know a bit of both. For instance, if you're doing freelance work as a web dev, it's important to know ui/ux design to make your websites look sharp and user-friendly. You should pick which path you want to take based on where you find satisfaction. For me, I absolutely love building something and seeing the hard work I've poured into a project after it's done.Best of luck, and everything will be okay no matter what you choose!",

For instance, processing optimization would be c++, rust, go. Memory allocation/optimization would be c or c#. If you're trying to program AI or ML integration or data analysis, look into python. Python is easiest to learn in my opinion, but it is not as fast as c++.But then again, im not an expert, so I would strongly urge you to do your own research so that you can figure out what you think is best. I personally like C++ most and it was the lang I was taught at the beginning, but it really depends on what you want to do!Also, just a quick tip that with being a good programmer, on top of having a language you know in depth, its crucial that you know how to adapt to new languages quickly. But don't worry, focus on one language for now, and understand the fundamentals of programming like data structures, algorithms, etc., and programming will become a lot easier.Let me know if you want to know anything more :)",

When I first started learning web dev, I started from the very basics with react, and I got some good fundamental knowledge there. I would probably get a book, but only for very fundamental stuff like c++, javascript, or Java, although this is just a recommendation.Also, projects, projects, projects!! Practicing code in any way that is challenging yourself is probably one of the best ways to expand your skillset. Choose a simple project to work on that you have an interest for or would help you out in your own life. Just a fair warning that if you choose to use AI, try not to use it all the time, and use it wisely. I used to use chatgpt, copilot a lot when I first started out, and it's a trap, and it doesn't help you learn despite how fast you get things done. Really nail these concepts in by turning off copilot and learn how to read documentation too.Lastly, don't be afraid to fail. Failure is one of the best ways to learn. Don't be too concerned with what are the best practices for something at the very beginning. Programming is all about problem solving, so try to solve the problem yourself first, and then look into better practices afterwards. This way, you don't get overwhelmed by the varying different solutions to different problems.",

Go onto LinkedIn, filter by recently added, apply to pretty much anything relevant with under 100 applicants. The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. 2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. 3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. \"Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%\"). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.4. If a job requires a cover letter, it usually has less candidates. It sucks, but it's usually worth it. Don't use AI, just write about how your skills that are relevant to the position helped you deliver results.",

I get it, job listers have leverage at the moment so they get to set the rules, but you can't be mad when you set bullshit standards and wonder why you're attracting bullshit candidates.

It's more about the stress of being put in impossible positions with limited autonomy.One of the more common recent impossible positions is the expectation of living up to the expectations of somebody who has given you what they believe to be a magic box and being told that if you can't get the magic box to sing then you are a fucking failure.It isn't just AI, of course, you could be given a horribly broken API and told to make it work. You might be given vague specifications (\"do thing that make profit!\") alongside very precise and bullshit instructions as to how you should implement something (\"using latest AI models!\"). You might have a coworker or boss whose approval you rely upon who is toxic. There are countless examples where your autonomy is stripped and you are put in an impossible position and you are pointedly told to deal and STFU.Burnout isn't limited to just tech, but I think it's more common in tech than most professions to have a few decisions made above you to render pointless the entirety of your work output while the expectations to \"perform\" remain.",

The very real risk of layoffs without warning.4. Being constantly individually measured and tracked in an overwhelming number of ways (most of which are divorced from actual productivity).5. As a developer, spending less than 10% of my time actually developing (and instead wearing mostly Ops and BA hats because the employer doesn't want to actually have Ops engineers or BAs).6. The bureaucracy - Agile in name only, sprawling meetings, seemingly random change moratoriums, sudden drastic changes in policies, etc.7. No control over fixing any of it.How am I breaking out?

Its impossible to estimate \"potential and problem-solving ability\" from a single interview. Companies were not hiring for specific tech stacks before because the demand outweighed the supply. Hiring juniors is always a bet and now companies have the luxury of choosing among a vast pool of them. Of course they will rather choose the guy who aligns somewhat with their tech stack rather than the guy whose only coding experience is C++ console programs. Risk is still there but at least the first guy wont need 2-3 months to start being productive.",

I job hopped a bit for some experience and title opportunities, but I always tried to learn everything because I thought being a good dev was knowing all the answers. Finally I slowed it down, I did quality work within my area of expertise, I gave myself breathing room and enjoyed 35-45 hour weeks. Next thing I know, I was promoted to lead, then senior lead, then director. I work at Capital One, so not the same prestige as many folks here, but the pay is really good and I can probably retire before 50 and all it took was me learning to slow down.",

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.Look at what you wrote:>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.This is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, \"why don't you just talk to him?\" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.You will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.You should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.So many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.The dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy. Others have done it before, you can follow examples/instructions, etc. Yes, there start to be complications if there are some specific requirements, etc, but you're trying to either overstate how difficult it is, or you're not experienced with it.",

And yes, the customer doesn't always know what it is they really want. They might think they want something but they really want something else. It is also the job of a software dev (at more senior levels) to guide those customers towards something better suited to what they are trying to accomplish.In short, coding is only part of the job. The higher up you go as a software dev, the less of it you do. As a lead dev, I mostly do requirements gathering, overall solution architecture, give status updates to directors and up and do code reviews for more junior developers. I also do mentoring and training of course. Any coding projects I have are those that I assigned to myself cause I either don't trust someone else to do or because I have some spare time to fill.",

They may have \"skills\" that make them better suited for managerial or leadership roles. My manager says he has development experience, but he can't parse simple emails coming from Vendors informing us that they are changing their API tokens etc, and needs a dev to explain what is needed.People who are good at the technical stuff generally do not want the additional responsibilities, stress and the need to deal with other people that comes with being a manager. As an IC, my only interaction is with my team and with my manager, so around 6-7 people in total, and maybe 3 on an average day. My manager on the other hand, on average meets with 10 different people a day and maybe 25-30 people in total over a month. I never see myself as having the bandwidth to be able to tolerate that.In short, tech leadership requires a Goldilocks person who is both reasonably adept at the technical side of what they are managing, and has the managerial and leadership skills that are needed for the role. These people are likely rare and are already at highly compensated roles, and they enjoy what they are doing. That means the rest of the market has to make do with the average and below average candidates, many of whom are the aforementioned people who convert from technical roles to leadership.",

Talk to all of them. 9 times out of 10 they know way better in terms of what’s actually possible and what isn’t.

Then go to LinkedIn jobs, indeed, and GlassdoorJobs and set up alerts there as well. On LinkedIn you can search for most recent job postings. It defaults to 24 hours. You can manually change the number in the url to much lower, like 4 hours. The earliest applicants have a much higher chance of getting hired. I wouldn’t bother looking for remote, they are tough to get. Look for something in office or hybrid. And yeah unemployment asap. There is light at the end of the tunnel, it just takes a while sometimes. I sent out over 1000 resumes and only got 4 responses. Send out as many as you can. Reformat your resume to be ATS friendly and make sure to change the bullet points from “list of tasks” to include what the impact of your work was. “Increased speed of X by Y%”, stuff like that. Need measurable results on there. You can have ChatGPT massage your resume to match keywords for specific job descriptions, but lots of recruiters are savvy to this now, you don’t want to be a 100% match. Any more questions I’ll try to help. Good luck :)",

I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. I immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. Apply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. Reach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. Start applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. While applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. I used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. You’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. I was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. You also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. Lastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband. You got this!",

Reason being, your differentiating skills are going to be in things that are not as easily duplicated. An underrated feature of AI is the way that it's sort of locking in the current prevalent tech stacks, warts and all. But that also has the impact of putting a hard cap on what we can express well in these paradigms. My view is that differentiation will come through mastery of different topics, like logic programming, machine learning, etc. and knowing when/how to apply these intelligently. In the future, it doesn't matter much if you're a React developer or not. That's not where you'll find your value.",

You will be fine with being a jack of all trades. But keep in mind the market sucks, so don’t consider that a reason if you can’t get a job. Also, 33 isn’t that old - not old enough for fears of being left behind. I’m 2 years your senior and also had a less than normal background. I have a lot more depth in front end and react, but I can still muddle my way through other things. And my focused areas for depth of knowledge has changed as the industry does (nobody needs the depth of knowledge I do about CSS or mixins anymore lol), but that’s fine. Understanding data pipelines etc is something I believe is very valuable if that is what you’re interested in, and I’m always grateful to have other devs on the team with some understanding of what I do (React) because it means we can articulate needs ro one another easier (which is why breadth is so important)",

A lot of those listings aren’t even real, and many of the “applications” are just auto-apply clicks. That’s basically spam, and these platforms aren’t great at filtering it. Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.Instead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills. Create a resume and cover letter tailored to each posting. Optimize for ATS and naturally include the right keywords from the job description, both the job title and the required skills, then apply.If you’re focused on remote roles around the world, check out a creative method in this Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).Mass-applying to thousands of jobs is just noise. In a pile of 1,000-plus applications in a couple of hours like the one here, I’d bet barely one or two actually meet the stated requirements. Be one of those.",

The easiest way to do that is probably getting a programming job, observing the various roles around it, and making a switch.RE your self doubt, you’re smart enough to get a degree in CS, you seem motivated to get some credentials, to me it seems like you have a strong skill set. You made a game and open sourced it, that takes skill.If you make a plan and present that to your parents, they will see it’s not your lack of initiative, it’s the fact that the rug (tech job market) has been pulled out so quickly from beneath you and there’s little to no support systems in place.Also +1 to stop searching for remote gigs. Execs want new grads in office, your search will be much harder if you are trying to avoid this. Additionally, the first couple years in office were so beneficial to my skills and career.",

They also pay for lots of certifications like SANS (extremely technical and hands on) and most US companies look favorably on veterans. Also for cyber/intel you'd be getting most likely a Top Secret Security Clearance, which eliminates much of the competition for candidate pools as you can't just get one if you don't need one (also need to be US citizen), and for tech pays pretty well (I make decent 6 figures in tech with clearance).

Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.I also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.Same for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.And yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.I'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine. Literally everything you brought up, I've experienced the opposite of. I have 12 YOE, so I've been around the block.",

The funny thing is, most employers would prefer candidates with a more dynamic and varied skill set.

A large corporate is going to have the people infrastructure to help you learn good, professional development practices. A startup is much more a roll of the dice.

The two different environments come with trade-offs. Big Tech companies are going to have very clear mentorship pathways and career ladders. In those roles, you'll learn how to build and operate scalable software that interacts with a large number of other teams. Start-ups will allow you to wear lots of different kinds of hats, solving more open-ended problems. It's also easier to work for a start-up on a personal level when you have no dependents or mortgage, since by-design start-ups should have a limited runway.The advice I generally give is, it matters a lot more what you do with the opportunities that you're given.",

You're probably underselling the skills you gained herding cats at your old place and also learning what not to do by seeing the consequences.Be a little cagey about the old place, don't say it was a shitshow, say it was a small startup and the projects had unusual requirements for domain reasons but you still rolled with whatever they needed. One of the important skills for someone more senior is not just to rubber stamp jira tickets but to instead understand work at a higher level and weirdly working at a dumpster fire company kinda bootstraps this!Plus you get to be known as a ray of sunshine to everyone when your circumstances result in you being over the moon happy to just work at a functioning company.

The candidate wasted time doing an assessment even though they gave a correct answer. They had no chance getting an interview because their resume failed. That isn't the interviewer's problem.If they read everyone's resume before giving the test, they're wasting time reading the resume of people who aren't going to attempt the test or who will fail the test.This is also why I now skip tests unless I think I can do it in an hour or less.

Big companies have UX teams that come up with different user experiences and test them with users. They also watch how people use existing interfaces, for example, to see where they are stuck or confused. Then they run A/B tests to see if there are improvements. For smaller companies, UX oftentimes falls on frontend developers and/or product owners. Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution. Then hand that off to engineering to actually build it. Engineering then demos it to UX and product to verify it’s what is expected.",

About the only site I can think of that adheres to most of his principles still is jacobin.com (I’m not here preaching their politics fyi).  There’s also the issue that the people who’d build systems have a world view very different from the average user and can often assume people should just become experts. You may want to look at the writings of Alan Cooper, specifically “The Inmates are Running the Asylum”",

Of course that’s going to be difficult. I had friends who held out for remote roles as their first CS job experience and many of them were unemployed for double or triple the time of those who were willing to move to a new city.

The exchange _should_ be mutual, that's only fair.As someone who avoids giving people take-homes. We end up with a lot of obvious bad fit interviews and wasted time as a consequence.

I was making a very good base comp. Enough that I had a small case of golden handcuffs. When speaking to a recruiter, I decided to give a number a little lower than I had been making. The market is rough, and I didn’t want to price myself out. I got an offer. If I hadn’t been laid off, I could have asked for more money. i usually try to avoid saying my number first, but I didn’t in this case. I may have cost myself money by doing that. When I told them my number, they said it was very doable. So, they likely had more budget. I explained my situation to them. I ended up getting more than I originally asked for, as we had some more decisions around comp, but not what I was making previously. I’m OK with it for now. I'm of the mindset jobs are temporary, but I’d love to find a long-term place. Of course I wish I was making the same or more. FWIW, I was honest during my interview process.

In implementing the Decision Trees, the very first check is to see if they were employed. If so, move them forward. They had other steps like whether they had an internship or if they went to a prestigious school. But whether they were employed was the very first check, and would automatically move forward if they were. I don’t know if they still use that model, but based on that real-life example, it seems that being employed is high up there.",

Then people in fields adjacent to them do the same thing. Eventually, the technical terms are no longer technical. See *use case* and *hack*.Another thing that happens is that specialized language can convey a higher status. I’ve found that when I speak in the plainest, simplest terms I can, I’m not seen as intelligent or expert as people who use highfalutin words, which confer an automatic degree of prestige.And I have interacted with middle managers who use specialized language and passive voice specifically in order to remove as much meaning as possible from their communication so they can’t be held accountable for anything. But they have to appear engaged and knowledgeable. I was working out the messaging in a public-facing piece of software, and the manager I was speaking with said “Oh, let’s use passive voice. Passive voice is good.” He didn’t want the public to be able to identify him as the source of a policy.I had a coworker once whose utterances were filled with a mix of corporate speak and technical terminology. I eventually realized that he had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, and he didn’t even realize it.

We haven't used it for years. But in documentation and informal conversation \"what's your LDAP?\" became synonymous with \"what is your username in our network?\" This persisted even after LDAP was deprecated. It's now been picked up on by people who have joined the company long after that deprecation. So you have non-technical people who have no clue what LDAP even is asking \"what's your LDAP\" when we haven't even used LDAP for like a decade and they joined a year ago.",

I know the standard answer is always therapy, but I do think you'd benefit from discussing this with a therapist because odds are this is the type of stuff where you kinda need to do some work.

Like, she did a masters and had no less than 10 breakdowns where she thought she was going to fail a test and get kicked out of the program... she got straight As bro. For 2 straight years.

It doesn't sound like it is, it sounds like it's literally just you not letting yourself believe that you can take the time off without everything falling apart.There are things you can do to help - like, you can put together a plan for when you're out, you can talk to your boss and tell them you have this irrational concern so that she can let you know that's not the case and you can totally go.But it might be trickier than that.",

What can we do to make our team more flexible, so that our ability to function well doesn't depend on me specifically sitting in that chair?\" Maybe have some suggestions - more comprehensive documentation, perhaps some cross-training with others on your team so have more of a grasp of each other's particular roles?

You can code in ServiceNow, but it's not required, depending on your specific task. A lot of it can be configuration. Also, the ServiceNow market is hot right now, but much of the work is in consulting, which can be total ass most of the time.Just find an avenue you're remotely interested in and find jobs related to that. It's just a job to many people. You're not alone in this feeling. To kind of answer your question, the grass isn't always greener, especially if you can't find yourself doing a 9-5 regardless of the pay. Treat it as a job to fund what you actually want to do.

What interests me is problem solving, good design, and efficient solutions, whether it is abstract code or something in day to day life. These things keep me going in my career even what I'm working on is dull and boring. But all that being said, there is a book called \"Deep Work\" that stresses that you can be successful if you find the significance in whatever it is you're working on.

Bad - family reasons. Really bad - pay, growth, “opportunities”. Remember the hiring manager wants you working for him as long as possible.

A school like WGU or other online schools are under 5k a semester, which is pretty easy to swing if you don't have other obligations. Get in the habit of keeping your expenses low now while you have your first big job, and it'll make life a lot easier.If you intend to get it, try to get your degree before getting married and having a kid. :face_with_tears_of_joy: It gets a lot harder otherwise.If you want to chat and have another self taught contact, feel free to DM me.",

Lots of people discover that they hate being a software developer after years of school and tens of thousands of student loan debt. \\- During school, you have experience that makes your studies relatable and you can apply what you are learning to your job. It improves your education and your job performance. \\- Internships optional. You aren't begging companies to give you a chance as an intern.

But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.By placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.As for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.Each one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.I can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.I'm sorry you are going through this. Hopefully you find yourself in a better job soon.ETA spelling out for the inexperienced that the boss from the job wouldn't be one to use as a reference if you waited out the PIP and got fired.",

He can do his work autonomously, but he doesn’t actually think about the business and what we can do to improve, he is technically strong. He takes something from the roadmap and kind of drives the execution, but he puts no effort into understanding why we are trying to do something or how something can be improved. He has to ask us for basic business context, which shows he is only focussed on a solution, he doesn’t actually care about the teams goals.

        "body": "I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",

There’s a higher ratio of customer support than software engineering. The happiest I’ve been is at jobs where my main responsibility is writing code. So, in my experience of moving from development to a more support focused role—this support role has easily been the worst job I’ve had. It’s contracting though—so there’s a lot of variety in my day to day: support and some development. If you can land a SWE job in this market, I think it’s definitely worth a shot. My experience is that while a decent percentage of companies are in some way terrible, there’s an enormous difference in what form that takes.

I can't speak much for ML, but I work in a team with over 50% of the engineers being MLEs. Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. There are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. Downside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. That being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29. All this is to say that its going to be hard to break in, but its definitely still a good way of life. If you got any more questions I can answer for you just go ahead and shoot!",

But from my experience, CS at UBC is pretty solid, and the program is renowned in Canada.I personally did a data science minor in addition to my CS degree, but you can also minor in statistics or math if you prefer to get some theory under your belt.TLDR: UBC isn't known for its ML curriculum, but the CS program is top-notch.",

Regarding your concern about actually finding a job, here's what I'll say:**You'll find a job**. If you're passionate and put in the work, you'll find a job.**Don't rely solely on your degree(s)**. Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. **Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn. If you're passionate about CS all of this won't feel like work and it will get you a job.",

Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.Recessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.The last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s. All of these things in the short term, but will go away at some point in the medium term.The last thing is that I live in New York and regularly attend UBC alumni events. The recent graduates I've met have it so much better than 10 or 12 years ago. The one thing is UBC is a lot more recognized in the states as a university today, especially among tier a corporate companies. It used to be the case that the main way UBC students succeeded in U.S market wasa via american grad school, because professors knew of UBC students. Now a days your seeing UBC students get jobs directly from undergraduate in Quant Firms, FAAANG and financial firms. THe one thing I will say is that almost everyone successful from UBC, leaves Vancouver.The other thing to get is tech is never going away as a field even if all the doom and gloom is correct. You are going to one of the best universities in the world and its academic brand is extremely strong. As long as you can keep your grades up, pretty much every graduate school is fair game for masters and paths to any university exist for Ph.D. (this is not always true). The reality of the world is there are MANY paths to success for someone who is determined, has some luck and siezes an oppurtunity. UBC is a place that you definitely can find a path.",

Whether it's more or less than other industries, I can't objectively say.From my anecdotal experience, everyone I know (once again not a very large sample size) at UBC ended up getting great internships at big tech companies. Some are in Canada, some go to the US. Coincidentally enough, I know some people from UBC who are interning as AI/ML focused SWEs in the US alongside me. I have more of an interest in distributed systems than ML, so while I haven't explored the ML path myself, I have seen peers from UBC succeed in it even in today's market.Let me know if you have any questions.",

The best fix is practice: mock interviews, talking through your design process out loud, even recording yourself so it feels natural. For UI/UX, employers care less about perfect answers and more about how you think.Also, keep networking or visit co-working spaces in your area because many design jobs get filled before they’re posted. You already have the degree, portfolio, and CS background; now it’s about showing your thought process and getting more comfortable under interview pressure.",

Instead of focusing on every technical detail, think of the story. What problem you were solving, why you chose certain design or tech decisions, and what the outcome was. Hiring managers often care more about how you think than whether you explain every technical term perfectly. Mock interviews, even with a friend or through platforms like Pramp, can also help you get more comfortable.Blanking out happens when your brain is overloaded. Try breaking things into simple, clear steps in your answers, and don’t be afraid to pause for a second to collect your thoughts. Interviewers usually don’t mind a short pause if it leads to a clearer answer. Over time, with practice, that blanking moment will happen less and less. Also, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of tips like this. Breaking into tech, career advice, and handling interviews. You might find it helpful for staying motivated and sharpening your approach.",

If you can't, move to first gear for a while. You are a passionate spirit like myself, but sometimes this endless striving pushes us to the edge, and we keep seeking and seeking. Whatever feels empty inside will resolve itself if you just stop the chase. You already have everything you need you're just so blindsided by the thrill of doing that you can't see any of it. So just stop, not forever, just for a while. Take at least 6 months off, take it easy, eat better food, sleep for a while, do other things, answers will surface when the storm is cleared. Trust me, friend I've never met. I did not go through all the difficulties you have been through, but we are alike in spirit so I'm speaking from experience. Just take it easy for a while.",

What has changed is how selective companies can be. Apply to a job if it interests you and if it's remotely a fit for your skillset. Years of experience is probably the main one. And apply to roles where there is a coding round so those skills can shine through>I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber insteadYes, that's called opportunity cost. It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.The way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviewsI don't think you're being a negativity spreader. The fact that you're asking that question makes me think that way>You're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more.It depends on the role, always",

At Metana we've seen people make this exact transition without dropping 50k on a degree. The trick is building a portfolio that shows you can actually do the work, not just pass exams.Your research internship is clutch, lean into that hard. Start contributing to open source ML projects, build some models that solve real problems, document everything on github. Companies care way more about seeing you ship ML products than seeing another piece of paper.Also lol at \"computational biology being a one off\", that lab probably just follows the funding, which is how academia works. Don't take it personally.If you're dead set on the masters route, consider part time programs or even bootcamp-style intensive programs that focus specifically on ML/data science. Way cheaper, way more practical, and you keep earning while learning.But honestly? With your big tech experience, I'd bet you could transition internally at a different company before needing any additional schooling. The key is positioning your SWE skills as \"I understand production systems AND ML theory\" rather than \"I'm just another SWE who wants to do ML.\"The market sucks right now but ML roles are still out there, especially if you can show you understand both sides of the equation.",

My friends who got “passion” degrees like art, music, history are all doing odd jobs and barely surviving now. Except for one friend who became a sommelier and makes crazy money.",

I think the best advice I can give you is to consider all the practical life factors of your careers ahead of your current interests. Of course it is important to enjoy and have interest in your work, but when you have the tendencies you describe (which for me are related to adhd) there are basically no jobs that will hold your interests in the way a hyperfixation will. You can be in the field you’ve always dreamed of and your job will still be boring (especially early career) and require you to have focus on boring mundane tasks that are necessary. Given that I would suggest you think about things like job availability, locations that are hiring, starting pay, career growth, working environment/culture, ability to gain transferable skills, and generally how you want your life to look. You should make choices now that will enable you the greatest flexibility/options. I highly recommend narrowing your choices to a couple things, choose the degree that wins out of those, and aim for 2-3 internships between those couple fields. Depending on your internship experience you can pivot, change degrees or whatever. Personally I chose CS/SWE due the flexibility of types of roles, the pay, possibility for remote work in the future etc.",

Each line takes less than a minute to add, and at the end, you'll be able to calculate your offer rate, then make a new sheet for the next job hunt.Google sheets is really the app to do this, even if you save a minute, or 30 seconds with some hypothetical app, if you spend more than an hour or two figuring this out and implementing something better, it's still a time waste.",

Large tech companies especially love throwing CAP theorem, load balancing, and scaling questions at frontend candidates to see if you think beyond just the UI layer. That said, plenty of companies still focus purely on frontend-specific system design like state management, component architecture, performance optimization, and API integration patterns.Your experience with mostly frontend-focused interviews isn't unusual, but as you level up in your career, expect more full-stack system design questions to creep in. The good news is you don't need to be a backend expert - you just need to demonstrate you understand how frontend applications fit into larger distributed systems and can make informed decisions about caching strategies, data flow, and performance bottlenecks. The key is showing you can think holistically about user experience from both a technical and architectural perspective. I'm on the team that built [AI for interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this trend where frontend roles increasingly include broader system design discussions, so having a tool to work on these trickier cross-domain questions can really help you stand out when these curveballs come up.",

The reasoning is that even if the immediate role is largely frontend, we're not hiring \"react devs\", we're hiring software engineers who may need to pivot and pick up other stuff at some point.You don't need to name drop every concept under the sun, but given a set of requirements, you do need to choose the system components in a sensible and defensible way. What happens a lot is people name drop something somewhere that sounds like it might fit at a glance, but doesn't quite make sense in conjunction w/ everything else they added around it, I ask them a question about it, and they admit not knowing much about it, or worse they wing it, poking more and more holes into the design as they go.For example, we might be talking about performance, and then they add redis somewhere in the diagram, but it's in a suboptimal place, or they didn't think about cache invalidation or whatever, and then they start adding bandaid arrows and it just goes downhill from there.Another thing that a lot of candidates are surprisingly bad at is schema normalization, and that comes up quite a bit because data modeling is a sort of a \"checkbox\" topic.",

Your manager hounds you for the deadlines yet doesn't even understand what a cookie is or what HTTP stands for.A year later and, while passively smiling and nodding your head at your coworker's odd obsession and musings with disk golf and IPA, your mind snaps at a mandatory company ping pong hour and your heart ignites with a fiery resolve to double your salary and improve your mediocre career. You go home that night and start furiously sending applications. Only you realize that nobody else uses Coldfusion and whatever other ancient database software that you used at this job.

Unless you are an exceptional self-taught dev who has notable contributions to large open source projects, you can’t.If I was given two equal resumes for juniors but one had a CS (or related) degree and the other didn’t, I would choose the CS guy 9/10 times. I would just assume they have a better grasp on the fundamentals of how an OS works, networking, algorithms, etc.If this is a life or death thing for you, I’d say your best bet would be going back to school and trying to get a degree, but even that doesn’t guarantee you a job right now.",
