Some even get into DBA stuff for the given RDBMS software if you wanna go that deep. I would use learnsql.com for learning and practice and then move onto Data Lemur for more interview style SQL questions. Then if you have more time do one of the Udemy courses so you actually get to setup your own database, play around with loading data into it, messing with indexes, and query execution plans for query tuning.When I was an Analyst, I used to find a couple free datasets, load it into PostgreSQL and just make up business questions about the dataset and then write a SQL query to answer the business question.

As an example, using Snowflake will have a different approach than using Databricks or Postgres. A DE will care more about doing things efficiently so concepts like indexing, optimization strategies, and best practices are important and query engines are all different. If you use something like dbt for transformations then you will have a very different syntax to work with. Someone else mentioned using SQL interview questions and that will help with implementing stuff like window functions.[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/s/HfWY4gOSwo) is a great comment with a list of sample db's you can experiment with depending on what you are using.

But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.I also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.> There’s a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you’re lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.I'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.My ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.I run my transformations with dbt.I schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?> But here’s the secret the consultants won’t tell you:> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.One script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.I have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.These one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.If you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.When something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.Does the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.When each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.Yes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.Imagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",

Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. Obviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.But yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

I work at an academic department at a large university and basically build stuff for PIs, postdocs, etc to support their research.Downsides are lots of red tape, bureaucracy, and low (relative to industry) pay. So if you care about FIRE, rapid career progression, and being able to use whatever new tech the second it comes out, it may be tough. And things are tough right now with the trump cuts. But, you get to work with cool researchers doing cool stuff, work feels highly impactful. Morally feels good too, if that matters to you like it does to me. Like people chatting with me after their paper gets accepted into whatever journal and thanking me for helping make it happen, it feels pretty good.And it’s not unheard of for people to get good jobs with related industry companies if you find you want/need to make more money. Like if you work with chemistry labs, going to pharma, health sciences to biotech, etc.",

Most people in the organization consider programming as some kind of black magic and don't know anything about tech. And there's a lot of potential because those who fund NGOs in Germany - usually that's the government - start to digitalize their administration and except NGOs to do the same. So I think It's possible to work in this field for \"the cause\" and a greater good. The downside is: you need to convince them, that data can actually help them with their obejctive. And even if you you're successful with that there hardly is any budget for data professionals let alone data teams.",

This usually when a DE is needed for delivering this data.Coming to the engineering part. You are a DE who needs to bring that data in. You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. Now, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.The tasks themselves tend to be \"boring\" compared to swe since they are less \"creative\" and more \"engineering\". You are trying to build something robust and resilient so you have as less maintenance as possible. It's more puzzle solving than creating.",

Overtime, you’ll be able to compare the two approaches head to head. Leadership will ask why ones always broken and the other just works… also, the other group are followers. Once they can see what you are doing they will just follow. They need to see it, experience it, support it. You can’t convince them by discussing new ideas, they will always shoot them down.

There are basically two types of assignments: platform managed (all in source control, no exceptions) and data owner managed (no source control, but approval flows). New teams get their standard setup, databases/whs/roles and some pipeline to deploy stuff. When other teams want access to some data of another team, we have request forms that ask for approval (email) from the data owner, and upon approval automatically assigns the appropriate roles. Both the platform managed and data owner managed are also stored in Snowflake as metadata. Every day we remove any roles (automatic job) that are not assigned through these two mechanisms.",

So the code is my source of truth.If you are managing temporary grants manually, the only thing I could think of at the moment would be to either use a special role whenever you grant temporary privileges or tag the queries with a query tag. This way you at least have some sort of a log of temporary granted privileges and only need a process that revokes these privileges after a certain time as a cleanup process. (i.e. take all queries with the query tag, after a month or so revoke the privilege instead of granting).",

If the data that all these requests are for is general purpose data then I’d recommend just creating a role for general purpose and granting giving that. An alternative to this is creating a role specifically for timed access and then create a snowflake scheduled task to remove users from that role after they’ve had it for x amount of time. Another way to potentially manage access changes is with GitHub. GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. Another way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles. You could pair this with a scheduled task to remove access if you want timed access or leave this parameter blank for perpetual access.",

A good product doesn’t mean shit if they can convince people to buy it.Funding can try up in an instance.Becoming c suite elevates you into other c suite roles after the fact. You are now competing with individuals with decades of strategic cto experience with your few years. You either have a strong exit, or be prepared to sell yourself downwards to re enter normal engineering positions. It’s a double edged sword.Comp: cash is king if it’s a startup and team you know very little about, equity is always a risk but has the highest reward. If you take cash and funding dries up, high comp means you get the axe first. If you take equity, it better be no strings attached, decent % and you need to understand fundamentally what the projections out could be. You will owe taxes on the equity as it vests/earns so if it’s sizeable are you willing to pay cash now for something that could implode.",

        "body": "Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the \"when\" something should run (\"run this job daily, but only after X completes\").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the \"what\", \"where\", and \"how\" something runs (\"run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs\").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",

It’s been a tough ride, and I’m trying to stay hopeful.Unless you know exactly why they aren't picking you, there's not a whole lot you can do. Main solution is do whatever you can to maintain the drive and mental strength which has gotten you to this point.> What’s bothering me: • They reposted the job as “new” just yesterday • They rescheduled my final round for next week> It’s starting to feel like they’re reopening the pipeline and keeping me as a backup while exploring new candidates.You're in the \"speculation and paranoia\" phase of job hunting where you really want a job, you're close to getting a job, however need a reality check which is you haven't got the job yet. From their perspective: just in case the perfect candidate turns up, there's no harm in readvertising.From your perspective: until you get a job offer in writing, there's no reason to stop looking.If it's any help, I was strung along by a company after going through 3 stages of interviews (two technical, one with a director who cut our call off exactly at the time specified even though I was mid sentence) for seven weeks. In that time, I kept looking, got another offer, and told them to GTFO. I also had been unemployed for 6 months at the time so believe me when I say I was desperate for a job but not desperate enough for that level of disrespect.",

In this case specifically, unless they’re douches looking to waste both your time and theirs, they’re probably just looking to get more candidates. Doesn’t mean they’ll reject you, and remember you’re ahead in the race now. Go do the interview at the agreed upon time, then politely ask for an answer within a relatively short time frame (say, by the end of the week). Worst case they insist on needing more time, best case they might prefer the one bird they have in their hand to the ten on the roof.",

Sharing the model across workers and pinning GPU tasks to local memory is exactly what most folks miss at first, so you are on the right track.A few thoughts from the trenches:If you want a thesis-level demo, polish, add tests, and maybe a little dashboard so people can see the speed and insights. If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.Streaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is “near real time” dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache. Transformer summarization can handle chunks of, say, 128 reviews at a time without killing latency.with Dask on multiple nodes, workers sometimes drop off during long GPU jobs. Enable heartbeat checks and auto-retries.Good luck.",

The worker distribution helps with the cost as instead of a sequential run which took me 30 minutes to process a single file which contains 200k reviews, the current implementation takes 2 minutes to do the same. and the application is session based and does not run the whole time. I still have a few optimizations to do. streaming ingestion, though i mentioned it in the post, does not make sense right now because the steam reviews need to be extracted from their web API, since the application summarized millions of reviews, it would have to redo the whole process for the previous reviews as well as the new reviews which just came in. I could work on that as a future addition. Thank you for your input and would love to know more about how i can improve.

Building the full cloud pipeline helps me understand concepts like auto-scaling, load balancing, and production ML deployment that I can't really grasp from tutorials alone. though... even for learning projects, it's good to think about what actually matters vs. what's just engineering for engineering's sake.

Trying to find premade solutions as to \"how should i\" can be helpful in small dosis but wont actually teach you much.If you are at a point where you dont even know what tools you have for a specific task, like lets say you dont know how to ingest data to sql server through python then you can google or ask chat gpt. The most important thing is that you know what you want to do and you will find tools for it or learn how to build them urself.

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.Three years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.Breaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.The four FITT principles:1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.4. Two-stage - Raw → Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.We ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.Key implementation patterns:Dev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.Git as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.Incremental processing: Each increment is idempotent. Run once or 50 times, same result.Results after:On-call incidents dropped %New hires productive in weeks, not monthsData quality issues caught in dev, not prodNo more mysterious data driftCommon pushback:\"Storage costs!\" - Compute is cheaper than engineering time.\"Performance?\" - Less debugging = more optimization time.\"Over-engineering?\" - Worth it if you have 3+ people on pipelines.Getting started:Pick one pipeline that breaks a lotMake raw data immutableAdd comprehensive testsEliminate staging layersMake it idempotentFITT made data engineering boring again (in the best way). We went from hero-driven development to a system where anyone can contribute confidently.",

If you ask the self-glorious Analytic DEs (like me) who bath in the thought that we care oh so much about business logic (see my previous post), they just write queries for each table.

Some teams use...Excel sheets. Some tools such as DBT addresses the issue. But whatever the tool is, it needs humans to feed in information.

        "body": "Here's some general suggestions:1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap. If you can't do this, you have most likely made things too complex and your data should probably be flattened.",

The everything must be code approach works great at scale, but smaller teams often benefit from reliable, maintained connectors that handle data extraction while keeping the business logic in reviewable code where it belongs.For example, Windsor.ai offers a solution that connects data sources to destinations like Snowflake, BigQuery, or your BI tools. It provides the connector breadth that teams often seek from tools like NiFi, but with API driven architecture that can integrate into data stacks.",

We have a small team, if your one is larger then warehouse may be the way to go.2: Yes, you do this by using sqlmesh python api. Create a script or notebook, point to an existing yaml config or define one using the python API. This can then be scheduled in workflows and run on a jobs compute. This way you can run both your python and sql models. You could also split it so that python models run on the jobs compute and sql models on cluster. 3: It’s not designed for streaming use cases. Maybe you can force it but I would advise against it.",

If you want to follow that path you need to add some libraries for logging, something that builds you a DAG (and know when something is up to date) and something that write documentation. For the structure follow something similar to dbt, where are the sources, the transformation (“models”), then tests (data validation). You should have a staging area (in layers if you like) and move it when tests are green the tests to your prod. In your python functions wrote a shit tone of defensive programming.",

If they don't perform well then I'd consider other packages at that point.

Ssis makes it easy to transform/update multiple tables at once. Python is a much steeper learning curve.

You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.If you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.The benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. To make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates. The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.I could dig up an example query if that would help.",

However, only if I felt that I would have the opportunity to follow-up by upgrading to event-driven fairly quickly.The issue is that temporarily-scheduled jobs *seem* simple, but have very serious issues that some people don't notice: * Late-arriving data: the upstream system is down, crashes, slow, incoming data is slow, logic errors, whatever. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Ingestion system is down when scheduled to run, crashes, etc - cannot run, this period never runs or only runs after someone wakes up and starts it. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Infrequently-run scheduled processes often have enormous data volumes and run very slowly. The result is that users have to wait to see data, and when things break then engineers get woken up to fix problem and then are up all night babysitting them and users could miss out on an entire day's worth of data.",

Dump a file system snapshot of the database and run a giant global shuffle sort spark job to get thousands of partitions historically up to the above quiescence point. Write to the same S3 partitions you created in 1.4. Run a thread pool and your custom application code to query it in parallel and make it look pretty on your dashboard of choice. This is embarrassingly parallel up to the number of partitions you created.All these fancy technologies like dbt, Kafka, Airflow, dagster, etc are complex solutions to non problems.

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.Hope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",

And instead of doing it with systems we do it with manual effort. Case in point - we changed the way some data was represented in the application. The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. In other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests. Breakage was fine and normal and planned for and dealt with accordingly. Here, breakage is seen as catastrophic... Yet we don't spend time engineering against it.",

It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.**Is it important for data to get into the \"warehouse\" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \\-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. **As for your questions:** 1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. 2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. 3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. 5. We see folks mostly running materialized views, but admittedly we have less visibility here.",

The platform handles the extraction and loading automatically, letting you focus on the transformation layer in Python/SQL. You can continue using your current scheduled notebook approach or migrate to dbt Cloud for more structured transformations. The data flows into Power BI from BigQuery or Snowflake through native connectors.",

Normally, the hierarchy would be defined in the OPC UA server, which would provide a template for you to use. So, the first option is to manually define the node mapping with the full path, second and probably best option, use tags for grouping with the bracketed notation config. This is still something that I want to try out.2. This is a continuous process but should be similar for batching processes. You would monitor the same process tags at the end of the day. You can add additional tags to the data to add batch specific info - maybe using a processor plugin like starlark or even a Python plugin in InfluxDB. 3. The PLC uses OPC UA by default and also offers a Pub/Sub connection. This is a standard industrial protocol so used it as is.",

Many of these do offer a SQL layer on top - either additional software or third party, but these normally don't scale well for large time-series data extraction.You are right, data compression and transformation at the source would help reduce cloud costs, but the objective is to move data once from on-prem and not hit those systems again should there be other transformations or new requirements. If there is no need for raw data, then definitely aggregate before uploading.ADX stores data efficiently but also has the option for external tables, one of which can link to parquet files in object storage. So older data can be exported to cold storage and partitioned correctly to still be queryable in ADX.",

We (the data team) just got in talks with that other company by the introduction from the CEO and know that he and his newly formed company (just for this project) with rebuild the whole thing independently from the current IT and data systems.when we asked how we can cooperate and what's the architecture they're aiming for they just sent us the doc file which describe the storage stack, not even the architecture or how others components like DWH, ML and Governance would fit in. FYI, we currently have a lake (Minio - Iceberg) which store raw data and a DWH (dimensional model) for analytics and BI. In the future maybe I'll merge the lake and DWH into a lakehouse for better governance but migrating all the ETL logics sounds like lots of work so it's not a priority right now. Otherwise things are running fine without any complaint.",

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? - What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? - Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? Generally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.Personally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",

        "body": "> it's taking longer than I *feel* it should takeGZip compression isn't inherently \"splittable\" (mentioned already by another), because it doesn't provide a way to 'jump ahead' in the data and know where you are to start decompressing. This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.If you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read themThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.---There are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.Uploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.A potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.Another *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.The best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s \"COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\"`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",

As an intern you're not expected to know what you're doing, you're expected to learn.And if the questions are truly dumb, ask your favorite LLM. I am always presenting my idea for how to tackle a project to Chat GPT and asking if it is sound and in line with best practices, and if there are any other approaches I haven't considered or things I missed. This is *extremely* helpful when working in areas you don't (yet) know well, and a reasonable sanity check when you do know them well. LLMs do this kind of stuff better than they do code.Broadly speaking, on any team, success means having the humility to make the rational choice as regards achieving the best result - in this case meaning build an effective workflow with robust automations. And humility means, among other things, asking questions when that would result in you writing better code or making more progress on something. Good mentors know this and love answering questions. It's much better to look like you're an effective worker than to look like you 100% know what you're doing.",

        "body": "I have thought about this a lot lately. I disagree with you when it comes to students. They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I. A.I. destroys your ability to think. It may not happen immediately, but it does. I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time. This isn't just happening to programmers. This is happening to other fields as well. The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it. Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool. It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning. This is also why you take so many math classes. Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills. The same goes for programmingI'm speaking from experience on this. I'm a 3rd year CS student. My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class. Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion. Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I. I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer. I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps. I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again. I actually retained the information that time.I have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code. I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects. This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design. Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity. I would love for someone to tell me how they did that if they don't know how to code.",

This fuels the mythology: you’re either a wizard or doomed.Unlike Python or JavaScript, you don’t get guardrails. Crashes, memory leaks, and security bugs are easy to write. Meanwhile, Rust, Go and others provide modern alternatives with safer defaults for many tasks. Python and Java are easier for most high-level work. So for hobbyists or self-learners, Python is simply a better first (or second) language. C++ is like learning calculus before arithmetic.But C++ still does matter. There is a ton of existing code written in C++ that needs maintaining and the language is still unmatched in performance-critical domains. And there is a lot of learning value in it. Even moderate exposure can teach you a lot about how computers work under the hood.So in a way, it is indeed Excalibur: It’s immensely powerful and if misused, it can easily destroy you. But those who master it wield near-magical abilities.",

        "body": "I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the \"safe\" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.There are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.So all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.I could go on. But the overall point is that1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.C++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",

The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. Barring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. Yeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. The language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. But most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution. It's just that the right solutions aren't the obvious ones.",

C++ is also unmanaged, not running in basically a VM like C# and Java, so it's a little more efficient in that regard. Also, you're relatively unrestricted in what you can do with C++, so if you know what you're doing, C++ is a very powerful language.Since the C++11 standard, C++ has gained a lot of more modern features too.

Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.What you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.And not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.And remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!update : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",

For example, accessing the first item in an array. It doesn’t matter how many elements are in the array, it always takes the same amount of time.O(n): linear time. This describes behavior that scales linearly as the input gets bigger. For example, printing each element in an array. As the input grows, so does the time.O(n²): quadratic time. This usually shows up when you have nested loops (a loop inside a loop) both running over the same input. For example, comparing every element in an array to every other element. The time it takes to complete a nested loop structure increases more and more as the input grows, even more than linearly.",

It only cares about the pattern of how task time increases with the list size.The most common and simple patterns are:* O(1) - Always equally fast: * MEANING: No matter how many things are on the list, the task always takes the same amount of time. * Example: Opening the front door of your house. Whether you have 10 guests or 1,000, the door takes the same amount of time to open.* O(n) - Slows down proportionally: * MEANING: If the list doubles, the task takes twice as long. * Example: Counting how many socks are in a basket. If there are twice as many socks, it takes twice as long to count them all.* O(n\\^2) - Slows down very quickly: * MEANING: If the list doubles, the task takes four times as long. If it triples, it takes nine times longer. It's very inefficient for large lists. * Example: Introducing each person at a party to everyone else. If the party has twice as many people, the presentations become much longer.This is to know if your approach will work well when you have a lot of data.You want it to be O(1) or O(n) if possible, and avoid O(n\\^2) when the list is large.",

        "body": "People are often thrown into this class with only a vague notion of what a log in math is. This is a bad starting point right off the bat. Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING. Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm. Those numbers can be similar or very different.You are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION. The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result. Eg array\\[user\\_input\\] = 0; you go there, you do something, you are done. Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing. You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.O(N) is similar. you iterate an array and add 5 to each element. How many times did you add 5? Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say... that is abstracted to the letter \"N' which just means \"some amount of them\". You write that one O(N), see how that works?looping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen? Its N\\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ... right? And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\\^2).So the notation is O (some expression of N). some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot. Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\\^3 + 11n\\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\\^3) .. because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\\-------------------a log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part. I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers. 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2. How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half? Even rounding it up.. 50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done. Hmm. 2\\^7 is... 128. Hmm. See the connection? The math problem is \"to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100\". The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target. THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2. No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer. Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully? All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again... is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ... cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). That is about 85% of the big o stuff. There will be other notations at the same time that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.there are not that many REAL in use big-O answers. There is 1, lg(n), N\\*lg(n), N, N\\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\\^N etc. And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\\^3 or better). I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\\^(x+1/x)) eg N\\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm. But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students. You won't see that kind of mess most likely, or if you do, they will just give you the answer and tell you (indirectly) that it was a pain to figure that out.",

Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.For example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: for i in range(len(nums) - 1): for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)): if nums[i] + nums[j] == target: return [i, j]It has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \\* n times, hence O(n\\*\\*2) time complexity.An optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: prev_numbers = {} for i, num in enumerate(nums): complement = target - num if complement in prev_numbers: return [prev_numbers[complement], i] prev_numbers[num] = iIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.Another common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.Look up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject. Don't just rely on a single course or tutorial.",

Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.Like, look at some pseudo code like: function maxproduct(List l): int { int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0 while (i < l.length) { while ( i + j < l.length) { int product = l[i] * l[i+j] if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product j++ } i++ } return maxproduct }If the list contains 1 item, how many times will the \"`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\\]\" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?If you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.But if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",

You just want some kind of north star that gives you a set of problems to solve that is abstracted a few levels above, \"figure out how for loop works\".If you are more into mobile apps, build one of those, or do both.I think getting past your stage is a bit like doing one of those magic eye things (are they still a thing or am I being a little 'boomer'?), you have to focus your eyes into the distance, but pop your attention back to the near space.There are plenty of, \"create a simple web application with spring boot\" type tutorials, so start with one of those and get the simple example working then start trying to shape it into whatever it is you have decided to build, when something isn't clear, read the docs or find some further tutorial.Letting the thing you are building drive your learning is the way to go about this.",

Then I used it to learn how to export the data to a JSON file. Then I upgraded to SQL.This is going to be my career so I'm doing everything I can to be the best I can.

If you need to, just latch onto the first project you see on the subject that way the choosing part of the project doesn’t prevent you from the *doing* part of the project. Worst case scenario, try to recreate a project you saw on YouTube or something. Even if you break things, that’s better than nothing.

Don’t be afraid to do it wrong or accidentally make your machine catch on fire.Edit: I would like to add that you should always start small. Programming a microcontroller? In my classes, we always started with a program called “stop-go”; when the microcontroller turns on, there’s a red LED on. When you press a button, the red LED turns off and a green LED turns on.

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof? It sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. \"So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?\" The secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness. Identifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second. The thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table. With that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table. Further, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.* I hope this helps you feel better.",

But when companies were trying to suck up as much talent as possible, it was worthwhile for them to grab \"juniors\" who still pretty much didn't know how to program but were motivated and then you could teach them how to program on the job.The market is tighter now, so companies aren't as willing to hire enthusiastic beginners. They want people who can actually program.The \"build stuff\" advice is good in that the only way to learn how to program is to *do it*, but frankly little learning projects and stuff like that (especially anything based off of tutorials - no one cares you can write a todo app) don't say much to an employer, either.Employers *do* care if you've *shipped product* \\- that is, you've produced real software that solves a real business problem and has real actual customers. You get experience doing that which is really irreplaceable. A key thing is when you're working for someone else (whether a boss or customers), you're put in situations where *you have to solve problems you don't know how to solve yet*. For a little learning project, you'll just naturally end up building it the way you know how (or how a tutorial is telling you how to do it). But when you've got external demands on you, you're forced into situations where you have to build or fix something and you have no clue how to do it - and maybe no one else on the planet does either - so you have to figure it out. That \"figuring it out\" is the actual vital skill people want.Of course, that puts you in the \"you need to have experience to get experience\" trap, so if you're just starting out the gold standard remains \"4 year B.Sc. in Computer Science + an internship\". It isn't the same as professional work experience, but it shows some ability to do hard work over an extended period of time and to follow instructions.",

This increased visibility and market conditions created an ideal environment for MOOCs and certifications of completion to boom.>\\- Would you recommend someone new today focus on getting certificates—or just build stuff?Same advice I give on r/coursera , I recommend newcomers to focus on skills and projects.

Yet, instead of utilizing these resources to improve yourself, you have decided to effectively hire a third party (AI) to do your work. You have nobody to blame but yourself.> So my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning?Yes, you start at the beginning again. You did through your materials and support them with the internet. Check the **Frequently Asked Questions** here in the subreddit sidebar for recommended learning resources.Stop using AI for anything apart from getting deeper explanations. Under no circumstances use it to do your thinking, to give you solutions, to give you code. Do not copy-paste code from somewhere else. Type it yourself.Learning programming requires effort. Learning programming requires practice. You need to come up with your own solutions. You need to struggle. You need to fight. You need to fail. You need to solve. This is how learning works, not through letting others (AI) do the work for you.",

That a class can act as a simple object containing only it's properties without behavior (POCO / POJO / DTO), or a class act as a namespace with methods (note: avoid static methods this way) but without properties.",

I try as hard as possible to stay within strict typing and view weak typing as a curse and a crutch.But that’s me. I’m not a web developer, I’ve always been more interested in embedded systems or high-performance code designed to run within restricted resources.Functional programming abstracts too much of the control flow aspect for me to rely on it. When I write code I am thinking about data as real data stored on a medium or memory being accessed and modified. OOP allows me to effectively model and interact with data with several strict guidelines enforced along the way. This is obviously possible with any paradigm but OOP simply gets the job done best for me.When I don’t use OOP I use heavily packed structures and end up attempting to implement similar behavior.",

I totally coasted through my object oriented design class in college and then all those topics we discussed suddenly came flooding back to me the first time I tried to build a personal project of considerable size.As a side note, this may be controversial but I’ve found that explaining design patterns and best practices is one thing AI chatbots are quite good at. They will never give you a definitive yes or no answer, which is probably for the best, but if you ask it a question like “what are the pros and cons of making an object field public when it doesn’t need to be” it often gives pretty insightful responses with some reasons you may not have thought of before as a beginner.",

C++ is *not* a beginner language; it's designed by experienced programmers, for experienced programmers, to solve the problems that experienced programmers encountered with C. Not understanding those problems makes it hard to understand why C++ is the way it is. It's better to learn C, play around with C, learn C's limitations, and then learn C++ knowing the rationale for its existence.",

As a simple example, in C and C++, there is a preprocessor step, and there is nothing like that in Python. It is not a \"huge\" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.Another peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default. You must \"opt in\" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being \"virtual\" or \"non-virtual\", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.C++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.C++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.Python also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, \"generators\" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an \"eval\" facility which lets you evaluate code \"on the fly\" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",

Moreover, if you try to switch from a high-level (abstraction-oriented) language such as Python to a low-level (system-oriented) language such as Rust or C++, you will have to learn a lot of additional theoretical material such as memory management and data mutation safety rules. All in all, you might want to first decide what you want to write code for, e.g., games, and then pick the right programming language to learn to match your purpose.

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. It’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. If you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. Furthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. A way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output.

        "body": "As much as this may hurt to hear, but coding itself is neither a job nor hobby. This subreddit isn't called learnCoding either, it's called learnProgramming.IMHO what sets a programmer apart from a coder is that a programmer is capable of understanding (software) architecture decisions in their programming field (and maybe even make their own architecture decisions). A mobile app developer has learned the architecture layers of mobile apps, a backend enterprise application programmer has learned how to keep their growing projects maintainable, a frontend dev may know a thing or two about designs, ... .So what can you do? Understand that coding is one of many means at a programmer's disposal to achieve something greater. Then get a grasp on which field(s) of programming actually interest you.If you like coding, which usually involves breaking down a larger problem into many small steps, you can think of programming as doing the same \"breaking down problems\" into manageable chunks, just at a grander scale. Trust me, it's just as fulfilling to see planned parts of a program work well together as it is to write individual methods that do what they are supposed to do.If you still have absolutely no idea what to do, maybe think of a more-than-trivial, less-than-difficult business use-case and implement that into a program with an agile development style. A business use-case doesn't have to be money oriented, it can be anything you'd use in a business, including any open-source software idea that comes to your mind.While/after you get the right mindset how to approach program development, you can return to game development. If you do it right it'll probably involve having/obtaining some math knowledge that you aren't thinking of yet, which is why IMHO business applications are a tad more approachable if you just want to get the right mindset regarding project work, while doing some goal-oriented coding.",

I understand that Python is easy to learn because of it's simplicity, but there's a lot of concepts you won't learn because of it. My personal opinion is to learn the concepts on something like C++ or Java, but that's just my personal opinion. 1. I will say pick a language and stay with it. Become an expert in that language.

Try Vim (nvim with something like NvChad, or just try the Vim plugin for VSCode and get a taste for it). It is so much fun once you’ve got the basics down. It is worth it just for convenience on its own.This is my recommendation if u are serious about getting a job in this field as getting to know git linux and maybe even vim can help you get a foot hold.",

I started with that as well as C. This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java. It's all good stuff to know, but certainly not a requirement. If anything, can make you really appreciate everything these higher level languages are doing for you.",

And trust me, feeling “lost” at the beginning is completely normal.Based on what you said, it sounds like **backend development, systems programming, or DevOps** might suit you really well.A couple of suggestions:* Don’t stress about picking *one* language yet — instead, focus on building *small projects* around what you enjoy (e.g., a backend app with a database, or a system monitor with a Raspberry Pi).* Explore things like **APIs, data pipelines, Linux, and system architecture** they align well with your interests.* Eventually, try an open source contribution it’s a great way to learn how real-world systems are builtThat things are helping me, I’ve asked myself the same questions, and I’m a bit older than you. It’s totally normal not to have a clear direction early on.Most importantly: **stay curious** and keep experimenting. The “direction” often becomes clearer as you build more and reflect on what parts excite you most.You're already asking the right questions. You'll be fine.",

Keep in mind that once you have learned the general principles of programming (i.e learn to think like a programmer), learning a new language is very easy, because basically the only thing that changes is the syntax, and some quirks that each language may have, but the core concepts are always the same. Python is a good generic starting language to learn programming concepts because its syntax is not complex, and it has libraries for everything you might want to do. As for resources, I would suggest first using youtube tutorials/books to learn about different concepts (variables, operators, functions, classes, etc.), then figuring out what the best language is for your use case, and trying to solve leetcode challenges. Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization. Another alternative for when you get decent is to choose an open-source project that you like from github and try to contribute to it, in order to learn about integration and work with real-world systems. Try to fix some easy bugs, update the documentation, run unit tests, etc.",

Python is really good in prototyping and creating quick scripts that can fix smaller problems without trying to change the whole architecture. Sorry that this doesn't provide any answer, but it's really depends on the situation at hand. Learn the concepts, and what is left are the syntax and architecture the languages can use for the best. If you are somewhat adept at coding as a whole, you will see many repetitive patterns when we talk about imperative paradigms. Tldr: learn concepts and architectures as a whole and be flexible.

I'd rather use Kotlin. Companies with Java devs still use Java/Spring Boot for websites. Lot's of OOP, lots of Model View Controller (which I also dislike). Not for me.I'd pick Python every time. Even if that means having to use Django and Flask. I like FastAPI. I like C-style languages (even though Python is missing the brackets and semi-colons), I like procedural programming. I like playing around with AI workflows and tools locally on my PC, and online. I like Hugging Face (although, there's also Hugging Face JS). Way more fun IMO; way more my style.

I then call said lesson and if it fails or doesn’t give me what I want, or I get stuck before then, I watch the lesson again to solidify my understanding and resume the code block until it runs like intended.After a certain amount of lessons, since they tend to build on each other, I get an idea of something I could try and make a MiniProject method/function trying to combine all the previous lessons and building from scratch. Then rinse and repeat. I was tired of just copy pasta tutorial videos and then not being able to recall anything. Now I can print “Hello, World!” with confidence :)I eventually plan to go back at the end when I finish the whole tutorial/lesson/class on what I’m watching (like 4-8hrs of said programming language) to refactor and make all the lessons and mini projects code to be more efficient. And that’s in hopes of refreshing concepts as I clean the code getting some hands on experience, even if not crazy complex.An example: at the end of my current YouTube class/lesson, or maybe in the middle when topic is touched, I plan to somehow create an array or some data structure to be able to rotate my lessons/miniprojects to run and output instead of hard coding each function I want to run. If that makes sense. So I’d implement concepts I learn with my own notes.",

I have a file alongside each project outlining exactly what’s going on as I work on the project. 1) explain the concept, goals, success factors and a note on what I might need and what I want to learn2) I usually have a design drawn out separately but I’ll write a brief summary of how I intend it to work, classes that will be used and key methods or functions. 3) start a diary for each day or section. This is handy for showing what I was working on and how I approached it but also good practice for getting back into it quicker and having a clear view of where you are in the projectYou don’t have to be working on something new each day. Your having trouble with something explain it (you might find the answer while you talk through it), show each approach you went through and if you have to go back and change something earlier in the project hilight it and make a note on that entry incase you go back to check it. Again not every day needs to have an entry, just add onto the end on the one you’re working on if it’s a continuation. 4) At the end write a summary of how the project went. You successfully created x which did y and z. These are the things that tripped me up. This is how I got around it. This is what I’d do differently going forwardAnd these are things I’d like to improve. It seems like a lot of work at the start but it makes it way easier to track what’s going on and you can see find stuff easier when you’re looking back for solutions in the future.

Much of our work is to translate real-world problems into suitable data structures and algorithms and then implement them. We also have known \"design patterns\" and \"software architecture patterns\" that can help us when we design different systems (they also give us a common vocabulary that we can use when reasoning about different solutions). It is not that you \"must\" learn DSA to know how to write programs, but it will probably enrich your knowledge base, enhance your problem-solving skills, and give you an understanding of the performance implications of different data structures and algorithms.Having a \"side project\" is orthogonal to learning about different programming concepts. Having your own project allows you to challenge your assumptions of how things work, put into practice what you have learned (and learn even more from your own mistakes).You may check the FAQ (in the sidebar); it has, for example, a section on different exercises and project ideas that can be helpful.",

I don’t even know what kind of project I could build, or how to even begin.What do you want to do? If the answer is nothing, why do you want to program in the first place? Purely to make money? There are easier ways to do that.The answer still is personal projects. Data structures and containers are much better to learn when considering your project's requirements and tailoring them to fit it, than memorizing different types of data structures and containers while having no clue about how and when they would actually be best to use over the alternatives. And conclusions you reach on your own you will memorize and internalize much better than conclusions you reach because a book told you that that's how it works, which might or might not even be correct.",

When I asked him what I should do to get better as far as making something, he asked me what I wanted to make. I said I liked making websites and video games. He told me to chose one and I chose websites. He then told me that I should start remaking websites, not large ones like amazon, facebook, netflix, but to look at local businesses and remake their sites. Find what works and what does not work, make them better in either design or functionality.I did that for a few sites, one day it clicked and I got comfortable with building and designing sites from scratch. I learned to make a custom PHP framework then moved on to using Laravel.I would suggest the same, make some clones, learn how other applications did the same thing, build up your personal library and enjoy what you build.

Grind the idea down to the bare minimum, something you think you can build.Then, once you've built that, begin to add features - what would you also like to happen in the game?

The sooner that you get your hands dirty with bash, and struggle past errors until they're familiar, the better. Switching to macOS helped me with moving closer to Linux, but grabbing a cheap laptop from Facebook marketplace and installing a dozen different Linux distros will get you further and faster. I suggest using a separate machine so you can go scorched earth.**No** because you should stick with whatever you're comfortable moving forward with. People may give up over the tiniest things. DO NOT accidentally kill your interest in programming by changing your environment so much that you lose faith in your foundations. Edit: Forgot to mention that WSL is pretty good right now. When I'm forced to suffer through Windows I tend to use Git Bash for simple operations and WSL for anything that Git Bash can't handle. These days Git Bash for windows has the option to install a bunch of command-line tools that make life on Windows a bit more linux-like. Can't live without it.",

The exam is unknown so you'll need to use your best judgement and logic to put together a solution. Problem solving logic takes practice of similar questions to really perfect, but once you do it becomes a universal skill.1. As an exercise that combines these topics, I recommend making a small hangman program. Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. \"15326\" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.Good luck on the exam!",

Somewhat related to this, you could look into functional programming, it often has the same feeling as learning math.With languages you already know, if you are interested in physics or have taken physics, a cool project is to code up some kind of physics simulator whether it's gravity and particles, fluid, etc. You'll learn about ways to numerically solve differential equations to a high degree of accuracy (like the Runge Kutta method), how to structure your program in an efficient way, various data structures etc.",

You seem to imply that either you find something boring or too complex, meaning, the ones you find interesting are unfortunately too complex or out of scope for you to do.Maybe make a list of the interesting but \"too complex\" projects you find, and see if you can either find a common theme to inspire you, or if there are some of them you can simplify and start out with on a smaller scale.For example, let's say you find the thought of building a game interesting, but, games are too big and complex. Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. Some part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",

It's a journey, so allow yourself room to fail. Text books and 3 months? This will be dependent on your current life situation and how adept you are at learning new things. If you read through text books and aren't applying that knowledge practically I'm not sure how much you'd actually retain. Everyone else is pretty spot on. If you rush through the basic you will most likely regret it later on so give yourself a little grace on time frame.",

Ruby on rails, etc.Same thing I did. I'm a frontend dev and also a graphic and ux designer (which is half the reason I get gigs in the first place)1. I had to learn a language: typescript2. A framework, a bunch actually: React, Next.js and Astro.3. And styling systems: tailwind and sass for the most part and some component libraries.",

C++, when written in a C++ style, is more of a high-level language that abstracts most of the complexities of low-level memory management away.But, C is contained within C++. There is no real reason to write in C over C++. Even if you write in a very C style, the ability to use C++ templates and lambdas is a massive advantage that you'd almost be silly to not take advantage of, as you aren't losing anything for doing so. And references also work to clarify intent in comparison to raw pointers. Some things, such as complex initializations of constants, are impossible in raw C due to the lack of lambdas, unless you write an actual function for it. As for hardware limitations, the languages are similarly performant and it does not matter.",

        "body": "Hey, first off - it's awesome that you're already this deep into programming at 18. The fact that you can zone in for 9 hours straight? That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.Since you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school\" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.You’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Just keep following your curiosity, and you’ll build the skill stack naturally.Good luck, and keep building :oncoming_fist:",

        "body": "Can you give an example?Generally, it's a separate skill. Teaching as a TA or tutor helps practice; so does a client facing job like consulting. My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.My other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.It's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.I will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like \"I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \\[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\\].\" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird. Show you know the first principle or pattern and can learn new things.",

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.The way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a \"good job candidate\" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's \"obvious\" in the sense that you should \"just know\", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.After that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up \"X interview questions\". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.And beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems. That ultimately meant I was bad at doing coding interviews, and I had to swallow my pride and work through neetcode before I got to a good spot with coding interviews.Edit: I also verbalize everything when I interview prep. I'm not a naturally good speaker, so I try to talk through everything to be good enough for interviews. It's important to not talk too \"hastily\" though, you typically want to talk like you're trying to hold a conversation.",

For learning C, check out books like Modern C or K&R. For learning systems, check out courses/materials online. I recommend Nand2Tetris, it’s a wonderful resource. There’s no reason you can’t learn C and learn systems at the same time, but it helps to have some familiarity with how C works before diving into a really complex systems project like an OS kernel",

As long as you're aware of that, though, and have the instinct to check something with primary sources or \"up to date\" references that needs to be checked, I don't think this is as much of a problem as some people seem to make it out to be.Next, you cannot do common computing tasks on a book like \"Search\" (at least not in a print version). But for this, there is \"the table of contents\" and \"the index\" which may seem quaint but are actually better for learning, in my opinion. If you go to the index to find a term, for example, then your eyes will encounter other related terms and you'll naturally want to look up a few more and to increase your knowledge.Personally I like the feeling of holding a book and flipping through pages. At least, to me it feels a lot more enjoyable than scrolling through pages on a screen. Maybe it's just because I use a computer for work so much, that doing something on the computer (looking at document) feels like \"work\", whereas looking at a book on paper (even about programming) feels like not work, even if some aspects of a physical book are more laborious, such as flipping pages or finding the correct page number.",

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!Books have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.Interactive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend \"finish\" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you \"learned\" before the course is complete.Video tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.My recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution. Then you are learning!",

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.Picking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.It depends on the problem. Probably more than half of coding problems would be just as easy in C.",

There are simply too many technologies to learn and that targeted approach can really help. With an entry level apprenticeship such as a level 5 or 6 (in the UK) you dont need any previous development experience. Just a good , polished CV and a positive professional attitude.",

You have until the end of the year (Dec 31) to complete it.Recall this is just an intro course although as intro courses go, it's a challenge (because it's Harvard). The key is to do the programming assignments. Those assignments can be quite lengthy to read so it may require multiple readings to understand what's being asked, especially in later projects.The intro project is in Scratch which is normally aimed at teens, then several \"weeks\" in C, then a mish-mash of other topics like Python, database, some web stuff. There's a final project (I believe) that you are supposed to submit.There's also CS50p. This isn't CS50x in Python. It is just a course on Python rather than a computer science course (i.e., it's a programming language course).Give it a try and see how it goes.",

Currently I am not aware of your future plans. i.e :- If you want a new job in an another field of programming , If you want are currently preparing for an interview or are planning to do so.So, simple stuff, you said you made games, you can start from there, maybe study more DSA (or from the start if you believe you hadn't understood a thing.)2. Depends on what YOU want. Skillset or More Money from levelling up what your job requires.If you have the same interest as the thing you work, that's the cherry in top. If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.Also, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die. It's natural to get overwhelmed and fell lost but don't,my friend, it's a long journey.Also please don't try to learn everything at the same time, like you metioned java, 5 other things, first master one thing and then move on the other.3. You can use AI to either make you an intellectual or completely destroy your brain, depends on how you use it. ONLY use it when you are stuck on a problem or a bug for a few 20 minutes. AI doesn't destroy anyone, they let AI destroy them, it has been the best thing that happened to me because I used it responsibly.This was my answer, believe me , thing will get better, you WILL overcome the doubts you have, just believe in yourself,good luck and ALL OF THE BEST BROTHER, YOU CAN DO IT.",

Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. I think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them. Eventually, you might encounter a debugging session that frustrates you, and you might then realize that the use of SOLID would have avoided you the headache.

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

How do you justify if it’s a good looking car? Well the only way that you could do so is you need to have a reference point of what is “good” and what is “bad”. It’s the same case with these concept. If you never encounter a “problem” in an OOP language code base. You will have no idea how OOP concept will solve those problems. The easier way to move forward is find a project or build one NOT using an OOP. Once you build to certain level, stop and look at how your code wired together. Does any of the OOP concept that you know can make your code “better”.",

Another more accurate name for these constructs is Inversion of Control (IoC) and this idea came about because of TDD, and the need to inject objects to help separate production and testing environments.IMHO this design patterns actually go against classical OOD, which defines concepts like 'has a' and 'is a' as the types of relationships objects have with one another. Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.Now the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.Once you understand this, it makes a lot more sense. The IoC takes care of the construction of the object, and everything else is OOD.",

Only the server application has access to the database.If your client application has a login process normally you store a password in the database as a hash (SHA128/256/512/1024) of a salt (random data) and the password. The salt and hash is stored in the database. When someone provides their password it is sent to the server which then grabs the salt, hashes it and the password and makes sure the result matches the hash in the database.The salt is to ensure someone can't calculate hashes of common passwords ahead of time and just scan your database for those hash results. The hash ensures nobody can see the user's password in the database nor can the reverse the hash to find the user's password.The salt needs to be random/different between users as well, you don't want two people with the same password having the same hash in the database.",

Backend Service/API (Recommended for Web/Mobile Apps)(most secure and common approach for applications that need to access a database)* Client (web browser, mobile app) *does not* connect DIRECTLY to the database. Instead, it communicates with a secure backend API that handles the database connection and queries.* The client sends its authentication token (e.g., JWT, session token) to the backend API.* The backend API validates the token to authenticate the client.* The DB credentials (username, password, or connection string) are stored securely on the backend server, typically in environment variables, a secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), or a secure configuration file *NOT* accessible by the client.* The backend uses *its own* secure database connection to fetch/store data, never exposing the credentials or the db token to the client.* Requires building and maintaining a backend service.# 2. Environment Variables & Secure Configuration (For Backend Services/Scripts)* For backend applications, scripts, or microservices that need direct database access, store the authentication tokens (database passwords, API keys, etc.) as environment variables on the server or in secure configuration files.* Requires careful server hardening and access control to prevent unauthorized access to these variables/files.# 3. Secrets Management Services (Highly Recommended for Cloud/Complex Deployments)* Cloud providers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager) and third-party tools (HashiCorp Vault) offer dedicated services to store, retrieve, and manage sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.* The secrets manager then provides the database token/credentials to your application at runtime.* Many services also support automatic rotation of credentials, adding another layer of security.# 4. Database-Specific Authentication MethodsBeyond just username/password:* **IAM Authentication (AWS RDS, Azure SQL DB):** Use Identity and Access Management roles/users to authenticate directly with the database, rather than static passwords. This allows for fine-grained permissions and integrates with your cloud security policies.* **Kerberos/LDAP Integration:** Integrate database authentication with existing directory services.* **Client Certificates:** Use TLS client certificates for mutual authentication between your application and the database.",

That is, read a book like \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" and see the kinds of \"boring problems\" are being automated there. Then do something similar for your own needs, or customize one of the examples there to add features to it or to make it more to your tastes.I recently had an issue where I wanted to put some music (e.g. 50 files) on a cheap MP3 player, but the \"artist\" tag was too long to display properly in the \"choose artist\" screen of the player. So, I wrote a Python script to open each one, change the Id3 tag for the artist using a rule I defined (to make it shorter but still legible on the player), and then save it.This was not a genius script by any means, but to me, writing something like this is 100x more rewarding than solving a \"leetcode\" problem. Will anyone else care about the code I wrote? Probably not; I didn't design it to be a general purpose tool. If I put it on GitHub it would receive exactly 0 stars and 0 forks for example (probably I would post it as a \"gist\" if I posted it at all), but I didn't write it to get points or something, I wrote it to solve \\*my\\* particular problem and it was fun to write. Also I learned about a cool Python module with a funny name - eyed3.",

When I'm stuck on a problem in a new language, I'll work it out in my primary one (JS) and then figure out the syntax and structure for it in the other, it's really helpful. A little piece of advice: be okay with knowing that you will never feel ready. The more you learn about a languages the more you realize that you will only ever know a pin drop and never be a 'master' of it. It's good that you have taken on a role for now, but I'd just set a time limit for interview prepping and just start applying for jr roles when they happens. The industry is a bit rough getting into right now, so more exposure to interviews won't be a bad thing. Flunk a few bad opportunities and be more prepared when a good role comes along.",

A consulting company usually wouldn't care how you accomplish a task as long as it works. A product based software company will usually demand more as they have invested a lot of effort and resources in that product.> Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.A common pitfall many new devs fall into. Do you really need to understand everything about everything? Don't get me wrong, I want to differentiate between you wanting to know how HTTP server works architecture wise and you feeling like you have to know how HTTP server works. One serves to broaden and enhance your skills while the other only serves to impede you.> If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?It depends on what you are trying to understand. Do you want to know if it is possible to do a task using a particular concept? Sure, you can implement messaging between two clients using BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) by following a YT video. Do you want know the limits of what you can do with BLE? You then go and read the RFC for BLE, learn about it's specs, versions etc.TL;DR:- Both approaches are fine, it all depends on what you want. Want to get something done and don't really care for implementation details, go for application over mastery. Want to know what is possible and what isn't? Go for mastery over application.",

The focus of that book is not necessarily assembly language programming per se, but there are enough examples of assembly language programming in there (mostly very short snippets of \"pseudo\" C code and the corresponding ARM assembly language to carry that out), to get a \"feeling\" for the way ARM chips operate at the lowest level, and perhaps to begin to understand the assembly output of a C compiler.",

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.The idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead. Also have a look at r/csharp. If you've got c# questions it's a more specialised community",

The whole \"use a thesaurus to avoid repeating yourself\" thing that English majors do in prose is actively frowned upon in comp-sci works. If you mean the same thing, use the same word again.Also what happens in real settings is that rarely used words are just not as present as other vocab, so we either need to think for a bit (either to mentally translate or to search for the word) and this is bloody exhausting. Just reusing the smaller core vocab is kind of a defence mechanism then.> Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges.

LLMs simply amplify it. You don’t have to choose between “learning to code from scratch without help”, or “blindly copying what the AI tells you. Instead, you can do both: use LLMs to move faster AND still learn the fundamentals.Just treat AI as your power tool and not as your autopilot.",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.Being able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"You have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.It definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

I usually begin with a well-regarded book written by someone who really understands the technology (ideally someone with deep experience). Books like that often go beyond the surface level stuff you'll find in tutorials, and that depth has always helped me.No matter what tools or frameworks you explore later, I strongly recommend getting really comfortable with at least one programming language. That solid foundation will make it much easier to pick up new technologies down the road. From what you've shared, I'd say focus on either Python or Java for now. Both are powerful, widely used, and have a lot more to offer than most people realize at first.Once you're confident in one language, you'll be in a better position to understand how and when to use other tools specially in project-specific contexts.You'll hit plenty of bumps down the road, so no need to get frustrated this early on. :)",

To actually learn to program, you need to actually program. And the interface of most smartphones and tablets is just not set up for that. When people program for Android, for example, they use a desktop system for the development and then \"deploy\" to the Android target; I've never heard of anyone developing Android apps on an Android itself. The problem is that programming languages, compilers, IDEs, editors, etc. are all designed with keyboards and mice in mind, not touchscreens; they make heavy use of symbols which are awkward to access on a touchscreen; and things like touchscreen autocomplete and autocorrect, designed for texting and natural language, will be more of a hindrance here than a help, in my opinion.If you cannot afford to or do not want to get your own desktop or laptop computer, I would advise going to a local library and using one of the machines there.",

In school you had a set schedule for classes. They didn’t do that because it was nice to look at. They didn’t it because it works. Even if a 14yo student didn’t want to do maths this week they still had 4 hours in class. Now you need to set those restrictions on yourself. You might have so many online lectures already set out but you need to structure your time around them and plan your evenings to fit in the homework (prescribed or self assigned) ensuring the info sticks. Clear your study environment so it only relates to study. No games trinkets or toys just what you need to work. You can add some bits later to decorate (months or years later) but start fresh and get everything set up for your mindset. When I’m sitting here I’m studying. Set out a plan. You want to learn Java make something in Java. Start with a concept:“I want to make a calorie tracker” what does it need? Calorie calculator, database to record entries, GUI, mobile app, are we going to have multiple users?That’s a lot to plan and make in one go so let’s break it down into each component and make the calculator first, next let’s focus on making multiple entries for one day so the app gives you daily totals, now we need to display different meals through the day and process what each one had, next let’s make a DB and record entries there so we can look back over a week (do we need a DB can we just make a file and read from that). Do some of the real planning they were trying to teach you in uni and design your own software architecture. In the morning I’m doing study on the stuff I missed 3 hours, take an hour break, evenings I’m doing project work 3 hours. You’ll have plenty of time for enjoying your summer besides. Treat it like a job and you’ll be ahead of everyone when you get back. They might have a year up but you can keep the project work going and have branch out skill to other areas giving you 3-4 large unique projects compared to the standard “every uni student” project. Avoid AI for the most part. Try to do it yourself, it’s hard but that’s exactly why you need to do it. AI can help guide your design choices after you’ve planned them. If you’re learning about arrays don’t switch to a list or hash map because the AI suggested it. Nail what you want first, then go back and make another project using more complex systems. Java isn’t that hard once you get going you can get into it fairly quick and projects are the best way to do that. When people say learn frameworks and libraries it’s really what tools you have and how you can use them. Best way to do that is with projects. Do your revision and get your studies back on track. Start building real projects and you’ll get a grip on what you need. Make the simple things first then bring them together. Sorry it’s so long but I think I needed to tell myself that as much as telling you:grinning_face_with_sweat:",

        "body": "> SQlite cant process 2 requests at the same timeThat information is somewhat outdated. What sqlite cannot do, is process multiple *WRITING* requests at the same time, as this requires exclusive access (either locking of the WAL (Write Ahead Log) or a pending db lock). sqlite does support multiple concurrent *READING* requests### WAL ModeSince WAL was introduced, if it is activated (by default sqlite uses the older rollback-journal), readers and writers do not block each other any more, and reading doesn't block other readers.So sqlite, with WAL enabled, supports multiple readers at the same time, and supports reading and writing at the same time. The only thing it doesn't support, is multiple writers at the same time, those are forced into sequential access, because they need to lock the WAL.https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html### Rollback JournalIn this mode, which is the default unless the journal pragma is set otherwise, sqlite still supports multiple readers and only one writer, but; other than with WAL, readers in this mode block writers, and vice versa.What this means (since sqlite version 3): If someone writes to the database, the DB goes into a `PENDING LOCK` mode...allowing current reads to finish, but disallowing further reads from the DB. As soon as the last read finishes, the database goes into `LOCKED` mode, the writing access does its thing, and then the lock clears.This means, with the older journal mode, if a lot of writes happen on a DB, read performance suffers.https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback",

I haven't seen any sqlite distribution that wasn't for a loooong time.Good code should check however, wether the sqlite compilate used supports this, and if it does, which thread safety mode it uses. The catch here is that there are 2 different modes:`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 1` means multi-threading is supported, but auto-serialized. This is slower, but safer.`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 2` means true multi-threading is supported, but there is no auto serialization. If this is the case, and in many sqlite distros this is the default now, *threads cannot safely use the same connection concurretly*. In this case, a connection-pool is usually the way to go if you have multiple threads accessing the DB.https://sqlite.org/compile.html#threadsafe",

(In SQLite, a \"connnection\" does not actually correspond to a network connection like in many other databases, but the terminology is the same.)Transactions are associated with particular connections, so you don't want to share a single connection between different user requests. Otherwise, one user would be able to see partial incomplete updates from another user's in-progress transaction.And locking happens at the granularity of connections, regardless of whether those connections are used in different processes, or different threads of the same process (as long as `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` is used, as you said).

That said, comparatively, I feel like CS isn't \\*THAT\\* bad, a lot of the majors on that list that aren't going into health care or public education that have a low unemployment rate seem to have vastly higher underemployment rates. So really what that list tells me is that everybody's kind of in a shit position. Except nursing... but then you have to be a nurse...

And once they start making money, they will have more than enough accumulated losses so that they don't need to worry about taxes for several years, and by then you're essentially getting a 100% deduction because the past 5 years stack to 100%.The real reason why companies laid off in 2023/2024 is because they overhired in 2020/2021/2022 because they misjudged the pandemic spending.",

The common variant is to return both side views, left from bottom-up and then right from top-down.Q6: [LC987 Order of a Binary Tree. ](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/description/)",

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the \"but china\"-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant \"refunds\", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",

When you're growing, you need to hire a lot of people to take bit bets on many projects. You have to pay more and making interviewing less frictionful if you're hiring a lot of people. If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways. For startups and not yet profitable, growth companies, this makes it more financially challenging to operate. It also pushes them toward profitability and cost cutting, but this may not be viable for more growth-oriented business models.",

Then again, 0% interest rates already sounds unsustainable.My hypothesis for the bad market:1. Too much new grads and bootcampers, entry is impossible. Add on to the tax code, there are fewer positions than before.2. Most software already exist, cheaper to pay subscription for a software another company made rather than hire more SWEs. Most seniors with 20 yoe just maintain old software these days (remember that one Google article?), if not that they are getting laid off and then the junior market becomes impossible.",

This has nothing to do with SWE.* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. \"I work for Google\", \"Cool, what do you do there?\", \"Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments\".It's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like \"best\", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.*Your* \"best\" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's \"best\" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.If you enjoy SWE, pursue it. There's really no point in trying to argue it's the objectively \"best\" field. Let people do what people want to do with their lives.",

The disruption of cloud server technology thins this crowd out even more, because really where can you go from desktop support/networking if your company's server infrastructure is in the cloud, and not in a data center anymore?Devops has upended the traditional career transition from desk top support to server admin support, and now favors people who know how to code. For example - Cloud technology abstracts the basics (s3 file system architecture vs ntfs vs z/OS disk optimization).",

I have some experience leading projects. I'm very comfortable with it.

Same story, different angle. I know all the decisions we made on those projects, because I was a part of them. I didn't *make* the decisions, but now, in my stories, I did.I went from getting past recruiter screens 1/10 times to 10/10 times. It felt a lot more like interviewing 5 years ago. I still failed a lot of the later stages, but I don't care about having a 100% success rate. I only needed one job.If the rest of the market is lying, then you have to lie as well.

I think for that point it should be noted to not outright lie about things that can be verified (like schooling, certs, places you've worked, etc) however, embellishing your current (or immediate past) role is absolutely a must. Its important that you can speak confidently to that, however, so make sure you can answer questions about it at atleast an intermediate level in an interview setting. And this can also tie into your point on doing personal projects, which you can use that experience to fluff up your current role but it'll be worth much more if its part of your job experience (in an enterprise setting) than if its just a personal/home project.",

I felt like I wasn't enough.I didn't really understand where tech could take me and I privately thought I wasn't good at it.So I started looking at going into law, politics or journalism, something vaguely related to my (non tech) degree and which had some kind of prestige. Somehow I settled on law and began planning a career move.But very quickly I realised it was the wrong choice. The law students I met seemed highly competitive and political, much more than any programmer I'd ever met, and there was a vague desperation to them. I read frank accounts of how numbing the work was and the crises of many lawyers who hit 40 and realise they're wasting their lives.I didn't leave technology in the end, I embraced it. I was looking for a career to fill holes in my self-image and try to counter my gnawing self-hatred. No job will do that. And I began to appreciate how creative I could be as a programmer once I accepted that I will never be perfect at it.Over the years I've become very thankful for this choice. Programming is what gets me up in the morning, there is nothing else like it for me. I will always be learning and it will never get boring.",

I was a bit worried when starting the search due to the doomer posts on this sub, but it honestly hasn’t been that bad. I admit I’m in a decent position due to a well-known but not FAANG company on my resume (as a previous role, not current role), name brand school, and yoe. I dropped to about 50 jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards, heard back from 8+ decent companies (like companies you might recognize, not just no name startups). Hit rate is much better for recruiters who reached out to me via LinkedIn or email. I honestly had to stop responding back after the first week of showing “open to job opportunities” on LinkedIn because of the overwhelming amount of messages for various startup roles, mostly AI. Went through the process for about 20 companies so far, rejected by 15, with the rest still ongoing but probably not able to finish before the offer deadline.Behavioral questions and hiring manager rounds I think are a cakewalk, just prepare your stories ahead of time. Hardest part is grinding leetcode questions to shake the rust off implementing DFS, binary search, etc. Feels like school again. System Design is okay. Can be challenging sometimes, but I feel like it’s easier to fall back on work experience with this and supplement with some studying. As opposed to coding questions which doesn’t have as much overlap with real work, and it feels like you just need to study solutions to a lot of different questions and practice.I don’t doubt that the market is grim out there for new grads or early in career folks, and certainly worse than a few years ago for senior folks. But at least from my limited pov, it’s still okay. When I get rejected, it’s still mostly because I fucked up a coding question. And there's definitely no shortage of AI startups trying to hire senior engineers.",

You don't need to think to repeat the question and that will help you come up with follow ups, and the answers to those follow ups can help your mental gears get started while showing the interviewer your thought process.

I've had multiple times where I've had to ask for communication to be entirely via slack/email because I could not understand someone's accent, and it was stopping progress on our work. There just needs to be a kind, mature, respectful conversation about it, rather than hurtful backstabbing and mockery",

You go into the interview and the candidate knows nothing. Somebody else is directing him from off screen (or he’s just piping the audio into ChatGPT and reading back what it tells him to). If he gets hired, that off-screen person will do his work for the first couple weeks then taper off and the guy just calls in to daily standup with excuses for why he’s blocked again, and continues for as long as it’ll last before he gets fired (which takes surprisingly long at a lot of companies). It’s a nightmare from the hiring side. You learn to spot the patterns in the resumes over time, and once the zoom call starts it’s usually pretty clear who is a phony; but filtering through all the garbage and finding the real humans is hard. I know I must have filtered out a ton of legitimate candidates and I feel terrible for them, but there’s just not time to actually interview all of those resumes, so you do the best you can.",

Around other slang and informalities I'd take a cue from how he talks with you. If he's never talking about anything except in a professional manner, I would probably keep my communications pretty professional as well. If he's joking around more than you're probably fine to relax.Also might be worth explaining what \"up a few ranks\" means. Are we talking about an E3 talking with an E5 or is he like a director?",

Obviously that is the main objective but just go to the meetup with the intention of building your network and talking to others in the field.

Generally, what tends to work is talking through the individual manual steps id be doing to implement the task. So like if someone said \"why cant you just add X\", then I could say \"sure, I could, but the out of the box library doesn't do that. So first I'll have to find a different library thats closer to what you need, which means upgrading the server stack, then I'll have to spend a couple of days testing to make sure the new library doesnt break your existing functionality, then finally I'll be able to code the changes you want, that'll take a day or so, and then I can test.\" The more specific and granular you make your step by step explanation, the easier it is for them to understand the level of effort involved.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

For example, moving a stove from one wall to another. Because there is tons of complicated, specialized work hiding behind the walls. You have to move the gas lines, and you have to do it in a way that doesn’t interfere with or disrupt the electrical, plumbing, hvac, and god knows what else is behind the walls.”",

She recently invited me to a night out with some of her other doctor friends in the area, and you wanna know how early we planned it? *Three months ahead of time*.That's the time she needed to get all of their schedules and time offs aligned just to have a single Saturday open for a full night of plans.Whereas for me *all* of my Saturdays are open.

The questioner knows that already, and it just comes off as being uncaring rather than realistic.

You get an internship you have to be a currently-enrolled college student, and I'm not aware of any companies that significantly increased the number of interns they hired each summer. On the flip side, even companies that had layoffs continued to hire interns each summer at a similar rate.My observation wasn't that tech companies changed their interviewing practices, they just hired more. They'd interview as many people as they could and hire everyone who passed, rather than the usual case of some \"passing\" the interviews but still not getting selected over even stronger candidates.Overall tech companies are still growing and hiring.I'm seeing a trend to hire more in LCOL areas and countries - not outsourcing, but actually opening offices in other cities and countries.Another issue is that the number of CS grads has doubled in the last 10 years and is still rising. It's quite possible that the number of CS grads is going up faster than demand, so the issue isn't that hiring is down (in historic numbers), but rather that demand has grown faster than supply.",

I technically work a “data” job but most of what I do is building internal tools and dashboards for business analysts and data analysts. I’m one of a few here at my company that have a CS background and I became a lead within about 6 months after being hired as a “Senior Developer”. I’m paid well because I’m the one who tests if new software or applications will help the team improve in some capacity. It’s generally easier to get a job doing something technical at a company for a couple years and then pivot over to software engineer in the same company than it would be to get hired directly as a software engineer. In some cases you even get to skip the whole ten interview plus projects pipeline a bunch of companies are trying to do now.",

Then you get a developer or team to slowly guide you through the app/code, and get pointed to a bunch of docs to get you ramped up.You'll then get a simple guide on how to setup your dev environment with about 10 steps. 3 days later after debugging the fact that half those steps failed and nothing worked like the doc said you'll finally have a dev environment.Then you usually get a toy task or two, fixing a small big or something super easy - just to get you acquainted and you get ramped up from there.

You’re building to enable them, largely, but as an engineer, you can see needs and designs they can’t always see. So being witness to their conversations or structures can be eye opening. Having 1:1s and asking questions about the application/applications you’re working on will help. Who do you ask to learn more about specific parts of the app? What dependencies does your app have and who’s responsible for those? How do larger changes happen in the org? Are there special-interest groups/committees regarding your domains?

My current job is a SWE3 in the finance and banking industry (the leveling is arbitrary, I'm functionally a mid-level). I'd say I had it easy but only because .NET is booming and there's not a lot of competition. The pay ceiling is lower but if you're okay with 80-200k jobs at F500s, depending on experience, then it's a great space to be. Very stable.My TC is 130-135k with a base of 120k.

If you want to start working almost immediately, consider staffing firms, as they can usually get you in somewhere the same week. It might not be the best job or the best pay for the first 90 or so days before you go permanent, but I've found that's a short amount of time in grand scheme of things.

Got a CS version of a minimum wage job (some IT help related role - my standards got worse as my desperation grew) to stop that 90 day clock and finally got my first interview after months of graduation - SDE at rainforest. *Had* to nail it and I did, which is a testament to how broken the market truly is because 90% of the jobs I'd applied to by that point were significantly less demanding. I did a couple of interviews after that funny enough, but one phone screen with each of them when I made it clear I was an international student made them lose all interest. I know this sub has a lot of hate towards internationals which is disheartening so I'm taking a chance with this comment - but in some ways we're much more impacted by this market than you are; most of the people I know are very capable and it'll take years to repay any loans if they are sent back. Everything in the US is run like a business, even education. A lot of universities have fairs in our countries selling us dreams of an elite American education and how we get to work for 3 years to pack back tuition, only for us to come here and realize nobody wants to give us a fair shot purely because hiring domestic workers is much easier (as it should be).",

        "body": ">Many American citizens in this subreddit said it took them months to find a job. What are the people with a 90 day deadline doing to find jobs? How are they staying within the country?Some of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?Yes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).Again, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",

Or did you assume it'd be OK to wait until 8am?Obviously an expectation of after-hours responses isn't healthy, it creates a bad WLB. Your time outside of working hours belong to you. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.Another side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?Especially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.Even on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day. I don't guarantee to be reachablea fter 5pm, but f I get a Slack/Teams message after 5 I normally just pop in a quick response: \"What's the urgency on this? I'm not at my laptop (even if I am), can this wait till the morning?\"Communication makes the dream work. which actually kinda ties into a secondary issue... are you even sure this whole after hours debacle had anything to do with your managers review? Were you having 1/1's with your manager talking about what was going well and what wasn't? Your manager not renewing your contract should not have been a surprise. Sure that's also a failure of *them* for not communicating, but communciation goes both ways.",

People move, so stay in touch, make a good impression, and show them what you can do. People respond to positive people, so try to keep that going.Now to the caveat. In my experience (in the US), interns are usually non-exempt. So I don't expect them to go past their paid hours. If you have a boss that doesn't understand that, that's not good.

I've been doing this for 12 years and got a new VP 2 years ago and the first time he asked me to do something at 5pm on a weekday I immediately assume he meant that instant (because I've had bosses like that in the past), but I asked \"hey, do you need this right now?\" and he immediately went \"oh god no, no - do not work on this right now. This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow\".But i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment. And then you have to decide whether you want the job (which means you should do it), or whether you think this is BS and don't care to work for a company like that (in which case you don't).And that's the ideological answer: if you don't want to work for a company that expects you to be on call without being officially on call (i.e., getting paid more for it), then you shouldn't just go along with that stuff.",

My responsibilities include having a healthy service, so yes, I will work past 5PM if there is an outage. That is the expectation of me in my field of work. I can work till 8PM, wake up for an outage (while on call) at 12AM, etc. no issues because that's what I signed up for when I accepted the offer at that company.I also ran into a different situation where my manager brought a vague task to me, I broke it down and gave some design considerations. I suggested a path because I thought it balanced the pros/cons of delivery time & scalability in the future. The manager pushed for something that would've been delivered faster, but would have resulted in cutting corners and been more painful to scale later. I said this is what I think, but if this is what you want I'm happy to do it with your signoff. Obviously a year later when it had to scale, it was a painful process of untying knots to make things work. In our 1:1 retro, I highlighted a (probably passive aggressive) \"had it been done this way, it could've gone better\" and the manager asked why I didn't push harder for my design. At the end of the day, you're my boss - I don't care enough about this company to want to push things my way. I'll suggest, if you say otherwise - we'll do it your way no problem.Getting reprimanded about how they think I should care more etc. was eye-rolling. The best managers I've had were ones who understood that I have a life outside of work and trust that my suggestions are based on my experience & education. I'm willing to hear \"hey I think this way can work, are there any reasons why you don't want to consider that\"? And I can have a discussion on it no problem.

The tech stack, the team, what your role will consist of, what the expecations of you will be, what an average day of a SWE looks like, what kinds of major projects are coming in the future, etc should *not be a surprise*. These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.Next time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview. Otherwise you're literally just rolling the dice that you'll end up at another place that you thought would be doing X, but is actualy doing Y. You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.That being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.Also, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.Anecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.All that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that. My confidence, warranted or not, is what gets me my jobs offers.",

Use whatever you can 'on the job' because it sounds much better, looks better and I'm no expert at lying.* **Learn Postgres for databases**. Easy to install and use. Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing. I haven't used Tomcat on the job in 10 years. Cloud crap is taking over but local servers is a nice plus and they don't use cloud data. Bonus: Mock a database with JUnit + Mockito or PowerMock or whatever. You should know JUnit.",

The fundamentals you've mastered translate directly to modern architectures - Spring Boot naturally leads to microservices, your database knowledge applies whether it's SQL or NoSQL, and the core programming concepts remain the same. The issue isn't that you lack skills, it's that you're not effectively communicating how your existing experience relates to what they're asking for, and you're being too honest about what you haven't done instead of focusing on your ability to learn and adapt.Stop saying \"I haven't worked with that\" in interviews and start saying \"I haven't used that specific technology in production, but here's how I'd approach it based on my experience with similar concepts.\" Your Spring Boot background gives you microservices understanding, your Java skills mean you can pick up any backend technology quickly, and your database experience shows you understand data persistence regardless of the specific system. Build a few small projects using React, deploy something simple to AWS, and set up a basic Kubernetes cluster locally - you don't need years of experience, just enough to speak intelligently about the concepts and show you can learn.I'm on the team that built [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed specifically for situations like this where you need to navigate tricky questions about skills gaps and position your experience in the best light during interviews.",

Modern self-driving cars were introduced about a decade ago. At the time, there was a lot of hype. There were predictions that we’d have fully autonomous vehicles within a few years. Millions of truck drivers, delivery drivers, and taxi drivers would suddenly be out of work. Progress has been made, like Waymo’s driverless taxis, has been made. But, it has much slower and the edge cases have much harder to solve than anticipated. I think we might see AI play out similarly where progress is slower and the edge cases, which are kind of infinite when talking about general use AI, are harder to overcome than the hype masters hope.

The best you’d probably get is some sort of analyst role at a company, as they’d probably be interested in a person trained in economics. But in 2025, that probably won’t lead to a pathway into a more technical role, since most data science and ML roles are looking for either loads of experience or advanced education. So yeah, I think an advanced degree would 100% be beneficial to your candidacy at companies. In person and hybrid more so than online, since you’ll be able to network better. What’s the offer from the school, how expensive are we talking? Because there’s lots of price points in 2025 to get educated at. I’m cash flowing a medium priced school right now, myself.",

Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.Not having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.When changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",

Believe it not, but *hiring* is hard and time consuming as well. They're flooded with thousands of candidates they have no interest in talking to, and have to find the 1 or 2 gems out of the bunch. Usually how it works is they'll work through the initial batch of applications, try to interview a few, and if none work out they move to the *next batch*. They aren't going back to the original batch they already decided wasn't worth interviewing.So the Week 4 people aren't necesasrily competing with the Week 1 people.And even if they were... it's always worth a shot. The job hunt is a hustle. If you start trying to meta-game postings and conclude that anything older than a week isn't worth it, you're not gonna have a good time.If the posting is open, and I'm qualified, I apply. The K..I.S.S. principle applies to job hunting too.",

You did everything you could, managers don't care how much you are paid, so there isn't a reason for you to say that you are okay with less money.

Frontend developer is going to be expected to follow a similar study path to a regular software developer with some specialization in frontend code and systems. This doesn't require a class or degree. It's a common mistake to think a degree teaches these skills. A mentor can probably help you speed up the process of what materials to read.",

There was a shortage of software skills for a long while. And arguably there is still one for senior roles, hence H1Bs. But when it comes down to **entry-level** positions, there is no question that companies will still prefer Americans. The cost and the risk of the visa lottery isn't worth it on the low skill level. There might be more openness to it for master program graduates with specific skill sets. But entry level + BS + need for a visa in 2025 is a pretty difficult combination. You see tons of resumes in this sub from people specifically looking for sponsorship.That said, H1Bs are not the reason that the CS market has stagnated at the lower level. I think it's easy to blame a single group or entity when things are not going well, but there are more powerful factors affecting the market including:* Offshoring* Everyone who prints \"Hello World!\" Is a \"Senior Software Engineer\".* Companies that pushed the boundaries of CS are now monopolies impending progress.

I think dev configurations are a great place to start honestly, you get a ton of instant, quick feedback, LSPs are a gateway drug into incremental compilers, and in general how a lot of open source architecture is implemented is based on unix philosophy (do one thing and do it well), and this naturally lends itself to a lot of \"distributed systems\" problems (maybe not a global fleet of millions of processes, but certainly quite a lot; what do you think those processes are doing when you type \"ps aux\"?). also if you have a CS degree you'll pick up this shit really quickly lol",

I used to lose sleep that something random would come up in my background check and my offer would be rescinded (hasn’t happened yet…knock on wood). I don’t see anything usual in your post. In the very unlikely worst case scenario where your offer is pulled for restructuring or budget cuts, I think FAANG companies still provide a few months pay. And you cracked FAANG once, so you can probably do it again if you had to. I would try to relax as much as possible if I was in your shoes.

Practice with some LLM, ask it to help you make things more clear and concise2. What more does your manager expect? Do they believe you’re slow? Or produce low quality results? Or you don’t contribute enough during meetings? Understand their expectations, only then you can address the problem3. Most deadlines are fake, it’s better to take more time than to produce poor results, because then you’re late and people believe you lack skills. Set realistic expectations and work diligently, discuss edge cases in advance, write tests. Make it a process that you’ll always follow, tight deadline or not. Alternatively: find a less stressful job, they’re out there",

Idk if its as relevant for cybersecurity though, that field has some more well established certifications like CISSP that would probably be more recognized then a masters in something generic like CS. You might want to pick up those and then think about an MBA with a specialization in IT down the road.But either way if you're at a Fortune 100, or in Gov't see what they are willing to pay for and do those things.",

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.But if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total? That probably is worth getting a PhD.Now, [as some have commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3ueaa/comment/mw3rrha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you get your PhD in something ultra-specific, you might actually be limiting your career growth and potential. *But you don't have to*.A lot of people do their PhD in a relatively broad area of CS, or an area of CS that has applications acrosss industries and areas, and in that world you don't get the same negative impact of specialization.So to me, that is important - if you go to do a PhD with a focus on going back to a corporate/industry job instead of staying in academia, then make sure you shape your PhD (research, publications, etc.) to match that. Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",

The same applies to ML; however, having a degree in this area will be more beneficial practically than a philosophy degree.Personally, I would also like to pursue a master's degree in philosophy, but I see it as something I will do when I retire or if I choose to follow a management or leadership path.All be best.

They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. I took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. Chatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert. You didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful \"self-studying\" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. So just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",

I do engage with big writers in the field and want to do more formal writing(without LLMs assistance) so that’s why I want to go back to school. I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I’m at currently which I agree is not very good. I do believe in my capability of growing to write more academically as I have a strong argument against simulation theory that I have talked to both cs professors and philosophers professors about and got good feedback. I bought all the relevant existing literature(Dennet, Bolstram, Chalmers) so I can reference and engage with literature. But in short, I definitely agree with you and need to completely change my writing style and approach to succeed in any academic sense.

Your job as an interviewee is to convince the interviewer that you can do the work at or above their expectations.Don't fret about it too much. If you have the time and the money get some certifications, otherwise that's another question that you've got to prep for. Like \"tell me about this gap in your resume...\" IF for whatever reason this becomes a sticking point in a majority of your interviews, you might want to think about why it keeps coming up. Maybe it's a shift in what hiring managers are looking for. Or maybe there's a gap in your resume that leads then to this. Or maybe you're applying to places that really care about certifications like a more IT or security role. Then move accordingly.",

The fact that interviewers kept pushing about certifications despite your detailed technical explanations shows they're following a checklist rather than assessing your actual capabilities.Getting multiple certifications in a short timeframe isn't a red flag when you already have the underlying experience - it just shows you're adapting to market demands. The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.I'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",

Only thing is, he wasn't enrolled in any current CS program so def case by case. Idk if this helps but here are a few things to note:\\- Some internships require you to go back to school for at least 1 semester before coming back (for either another internship, or full-time)\\- You can either get a return offer for another internship, or for a full-time role. For some companies, this might depend on your graduation date. (Ex: they see you don't graduate for more than a year so you're considered for internship instead)So, even if you're not close to graduation maybe you can come back as an intern (a few companies might even let you extend your internship or work contract/part-time while you finish school) until you're eligible for the full-time return!",

However, there were no good software projects, it was just cost savings, migrations, and on-call.

We plan way too much (in halfs,) don’t stick to it, then thrash. Very compartmentalized as if whole sections of the company are external vendors. The best thing they have going for them is a supposed blameless culture, but this often manifests as a lack of ownership/responsibility for actions. In the past I was at a company that grew from 50 to over 1,000 and they were basically the opposite. Fast, not much process, pragmatic staffing. We planned more flexibly, often week by week, and later monthly as we grew. Culture was very open and encouraged cross functional behavior and leadership. The only thing I didn’t like here (besides stress that built over years) was the subtle blame games that happened behind your back. So like I said, complete opposites. Both are political but often this behavior came from career big tech people. Try as we might to start fresh, people bring their baggage and it impacts the culture throughout the industry, for better and for worse.",

Slightly more money isn't worth the risk of moving to a single client, imo, but if the consistency of a single product is enticing then I would say that's a good reason to consider the offer.Food for thought: most \"full time\" roles don't actually take up a full 40 hour week. You'll need to align with their schedule more rigidly, and give them priority, but there's no reason you can't keep your easier/smaller clients. Some people take on multiple full time roles, even.If you think this is definitively a 40+ hr/wk workload for that single client, though, then that would probably be the dealbreaker for me without a more significant pay bump. You've already accomplished the hard part of freelance--finding clients. I wouldn't leave the flexibility behind for an almost-equivalent salary. It's also still a contract, so they can drop you at any time, leaving you with nothing.",
