Some even get into DBA stuff for the given RDBMS software if you wanna go that deep. I would use learnsql.com for learning and practice and then move onto Data Lemur for more interview style SQL questions. Then if you have more time do one of the Udemy courses so you actually get to setup your own database, play around with loading data into it, messing with indexes, and query execution plans for query tuning.When I was an Analyst, I used to find a couple free datasets, load it into PostgreSQL and just make up business questions about the dataset and then write a SQL query to answer the business question.

As an example, using Snowflake will have a different approach than using Databricks or Postgres. A DE will care more about doing things efficiently so concepts like indexing, optimization strategies, and best practices are important and query engines are all different. If you use something like dbt for transformations then you will have a very different syntax to work with. Someone else mentioned using SQL interview questions and that will help with implementing stuff like window functions.[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/s/HfWY4gOSwo) is a great comment with a list of sample db's you can experiment with depending on what you are using. If you are going to be asked to spin up data marts then you can use the Data Warehouse Toolkit as a guide and try to build your own.",

But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.I also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.> There’s a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you’re lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.I'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.My ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.I run my transformations with dbt.I schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?> But here’s the secret the consultants won’t tell you:> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.One script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.I have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.These one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.If you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.When something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.Does the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.When each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.Yes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.Imagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",

It does this on almost every keystroke so we were either disabling the AI or putting them on silent. When we need to brainstorm ideas for specific problems, it’s super helpful. Refactoring was a mess. It would recommend changes that no one would use and massively overcomplicate the code.

Even nonprofits are businesses with slightly different tax considerations and unquestionably are run like a business if they are large enough to need to employ data engineers. Business objectives are just another way of saying optimization and everything we do with data, reporting, plumbing, all of that inherently is about optimization. At best you may want to align with a business that creates a product that you agree with. But keep in mind there are dark sides of a lot of these aspirational businesses; Apple wanted to change the world and they did but they still exploit the labor of foreign sweatshops. Tesla wanted to increase EV adoption and they did while at the same time working to block legislation for high speed rail which would have reduced carbon footprints even more by giving an option to those that can't afford EVs specifically because it might cut into their EV sales. Nonprofits in foreign countries spend a lot of time distributing aid but at the same time outcompete local vendors and stifle the local entrepreneurship that actually would bring those countries closer to prosperity and instead keep them in a cycle of dependency.",

Like people chatting with me after their paper gets accepted into whatever journal and thanking me for helping make it happen, it feels pretty good.And it’s not unheard of for people to get good jobs with related industry companies if you find you want/need to make more money.

Most people in the organization consider programming as some kind of black magic and don't know anything about tech. And there's a lot of potential because those who fund NGOs in Germany - usually that's the government - start to digitalize their administration and except NGOs to do the same. So I think It's possible to work in this field for \"the cause\" and a greater good. The downside is: you need to convince them, that data can actually help them with their obejctive.

In some cases the attribute is associated with the context of the table, product.weight in this case may very well fit that case. However sometimes the context may be ambiguous in which case it's better to add the descriptor. Also sometimes you may need to go back on your decision as you model downstream and the context shifts. Generally brevity is best, it's just less mental load and easier to read but you will find exceptions where the tradeoff is worth it.",

I’m working in some crappy ERP right now with no documentation, but at least fields are consistently named across modules and it even rolls up into the end user reporting. For example, if I want to look at a customers accounts receivable in the AR module I look up the customer_id and tie it back to customer_id in the customer module. If it was just “id” in each module it would be pretty annoying and less consistent when writing queries. id from the customer module joins to customer_id in the AR module and then for example ar invoice “id” joins to “ar_invoice_id” in the payments table. That would be confusing imo. Consistency is fantastic as it is easier to determine how to link tables as well as if I need to search through the data dictionary I can just search for “customer_id”.",

At least in my experience, the key thing to remember is that you get charged for the time the warehouse is turned on with a minimum unit of one minute.

If you didn't do that, I would definitely suggest starting right there.To that end, the more you can get queries to execute in batches together the better. If you've got something waking your warehouse up to run a two second query every minute, it's just going to keep the thing on all the time.",

That'll make a significant cost decrease. * Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables * Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",

Once they can see what you are doing they will just follow. They need to see it, experience it, support it. You can’t convince them by discussing new ideas, they will always shoot them down.

There are basically two types of assignments: platform managed (all in source control, no exceptions) and data owner managed (no source control, but approval flows). New teams get their standard setup, databases/whs/roles and some pipeline to deploy stuff. When other teams want access to some data of another team, we have request forms that ask for approval (email) from the data owner, and upon approval automatically assigns the appropriate roles. Both the platform managed and data owner managed are also stored in Snowflake as metadata. Every day we remove any roles (automatic job) that are not assigned through these two mechanisms.",

If the data that all these requests are for is general purpose data then I’d recommend just creating a role for general purpose and granting giving that. An alternative to this is creating a role specifically for timed access and then create a snowflake scheduled task to remove users from that role after they’ve had it for x amount of time. Another way to potentially manage access changes is with GitHub. GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. Another way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles. You could pair this with a scheduled task to remove access if you want timed access or leave this parameter blank for perpetual access.",

I know this will get down voted but an executive role really requies time, experience & wisdom. you don't have enough at 7 years unless you've built a unicorn..

A good product doesn’t mean shit if they can convince people to buy it.Funding can try up in an instance.Becoming c suite elevates you into other c suite roles after the fact. You are now competing with individuals with decades of strategic cto experience with your few years. You either have a strong exit, or be prepared to sell yourself downwards to re enter normal engineering positions. It’s a double edged sword.Comp: cash is king if it’s a startup and team you know very little about, equity is always a risk but has the highest reward. If you take cash and funding dries up, high comp means you get the axe first. If you take equity, it better be no strings attached, decent % and you need to understand fundamentally what the projections out could be. You will owe taxes on the equity as it vests/earns so if it’s sizeable are you willing to pay cash now for something that could implode.",

        "body": "Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the \"when\" something should run (\"run this job daily, but only after X completes\").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the \"what\", \"where\", and \"how\" something runs (\"run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs\").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",

If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.Streaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is “near real time” dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache. Transformer summarization can handle chunks of, say, 128 reviews at a time without killing latency.with Dask on multiple nodes, workers sometimes drop off during long GPU jobs. Enable heartbeat checks and auto-retries.Good luck.",

The worker distribution helps with the cost as instead of a sequential run which took me 30 minutes to process a single file which contains 200k reviews, the current implementation takes 2 minutes to do the same. and the application is session based and does not run the whole time. I still have a few optimizations to do. streaming ingestion, though i mentioned it in the post, does not make sense right now because the steam reviews need to be extracted from their web API, since the application summarized millions of reviews, it would have to redo the whole process for the previous reviews as well as the new reviews which just came in. I could work on that as a future addition. Thank you for your input and would love to know more about how i can improve. I am looking for resources to learn cloud computing as a goal for this summer.",

This is a portfolio project where I'm applying big data concepts my professor taught me to an industry I like.My main goal is hands-on learning with cloud computing and distributed systems. I've got the local processing working great, but I wanted to challenge myself by implementing it with proper cloud architecture, GPU orchestration, and scalable infrastructure.So while you're absolutely right about the business economics, I'm optimizing for learning experience rather than profit margins. Building the full cloud pipeline helps me understand concepts like auto-scaling, load balancing, and production ML deployment that I can't really grasp from tutorials alone. though... even for learning projects, it's good to think about what actually matters vs. what's just engineering for engineering's sake. It seems like you know a thing or two about cloud - would be great if I could get some resources to learn this summer!",

        "body": "Been doing data engineering for 15 or so years now (even before it was called data engineering) and for about 8 of those years Ive worked for different health plans. If there's a constant... It's that healthcare data is an entirely different ball of wax than you're used to working with everywhere else. Not only are the structures weird and deeply nested but the context of the data can be hard to grasp for some. Also, security is a big factor you have to understand. For example no offshore employee can even get a sniff of production Medicaid or Medicare data or you're violating the law. That's a federal law. Some onshore people can't ever look at federal employee plan data for certain situations. Not only that but the amount of vendors and integrations that have all these mind numbing weird schema layouts that don't at all conform to a standard like FHIR makes everyone's life hell in this space.Understanding the complexity of healthcare plan info like the relationship of a member to the group to the plan(s) to the product(s) can get a little out of hand. Then you have a claims where you need a 45 day runout because a single healthcare claim line can change a ton of times before it's actually approved or rejected but you have to capture everyone of those steps along the way. Then you always have to be prepared and ready for an audit by either someone internally in your org or someone from the government so your documentation and processes need to be on point.The reason why we need people with experience in healthcare data is because it's very hard to ramp up people with 0 experience. When I bring on juniors to my team I don't expect them to \"get the data\" for like 24 to 36 months and even then you are always learning new parts or domains of healthcare data and probably still don't understand all the nuances around the data. It's just easier to bring someone in that would have at least a clue about what a care plan resource in FHIR format looks like, how to load it, and how to extract from it.The true gatekeeper is really the rules, regs, complexity and lack of enforced standardized format amongst all healthcare companies whether that be health plans, pbm's, provider groups, client groups, hospital groups, these middleware companies that claim to give you robust integrations... It's all a pile of steaming shit and we are the plumbers to keep it moving.",

From their perspective: just in case the perfect candidate turns up, there's no harm in readvertising.From your perspective: until you get a job offer in writing, there's no reason to stop looking.If it's any help, I was strung along by a company after going through 3 stages of interviews (two technical, one with a director who cut our call off exactly at the time specified even though I was mid sentence) for seven weeks. In that time, I kept looking, got another offer, and told them to GTFO.

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.Three years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.Breaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.The four FITT principles:1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.4. Two-stage - Raw → Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.We ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.Key implementation patterns:Dev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.Git as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.Incremental processing: Each increment is idempotent. Run once or 50 times, same result.Results after:On-call incidents dropped %New hires productive in weeks, not monthsData quality issues caught in dev, not prodNo more mysterious data driftCommon pushback:\"Storage costs!\" - Compute is cheaper than engineering time.\"Performance?\" - Less debugging = more optimization time.\"Over-engineering?\" - Worth it if you have 3+ people on pipelines.Getting started:Pick one pipeline that breaks a lotMake raw data immutableAdd comprehensive testsEliminate staging layersMake it idempotentFITT made data engineering boring again (in the best way).

If you ask the self-glorious Analytic DEs (like me) who bath in the thought that we care oh so much about business logic (see my previous post), they just write queries for each table. We use DBT so every table is a \"model\", a glorified SELECT query with a bunch of configs. If you are interested you can probably create your weak version of DBT if your company doesn't use it.> how to manage the metadata of a table ( column names, types etc) that is tightly coupled to the code?Eh, different teams treat it differently. Some teams use...Excel sheets. Some tools such as DBT addresses the issue. But whatever the tool is, it needs humans to feed in information. Automated tools exist too I think, but it's just a ticking bomb if humans don't check from time to time.",

        "body": "Here's some general suggestions:1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap. If you can't do this, you have most likely made things too complex and your data should probably be flattened.",

If you want to follow that path you need to add some libraries for logging, something that builds you a DAG (and know when something is up to date) and something that write documentation. For the structure follow something similar to dbt, where are the sources, the transformation (“models”), then tests (data validation). You should have a staging area (in layers if you like) and move it when tests are green the tests to your prod. In your python functions wrote a shit tone of defensive programming.",

SQL Server actually has columnar storage, which is useful for OLAP workloads, through using the \"columnstore indexes\".3. Extract logic: Python, could use some higher level framework like Meltano or dlt.4. Transformation logic: DBT, could be replaced with SQLMesh.5. Orchestration: Dagster.6. Git server: Gitea, could be replaced with newer fork Forgejo.7. Dashboarding: Metabase. It is much easier to use than Superset.8. Ad-hoc analysis: SQL, Python or R.It worked perfectly fine on a single production server, although it was planned to split it into one server for production pipelines and one server for ad-hoc analytics, for more production safety.",

Ssis makes it easy to transform/update multiple tables at once. Python is a much steeper learning curve.

You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.If you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.The benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. To make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates. The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.I could dig up an example query if that would help.",

The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Ingestion system is down when scheduled to run, crashes, etc - cannot run, this period never runs or only runs after someone wakes up and starts it. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Infrequently-run scheduled processes often have enormous data volumes and run very slowly. The result is that users have to wait to see data, and when things break then engineers get woken up to fix problem and then are up all night babysitting them and users could miss out on an entire day's worth of data.",

Take a snapshot of the (I presume) mutable source database while creating a change data capture slot. This is your quiescence point. 2.

Dump a file system snapshot of the database and run a giant global shuffle sort spark job to get thousands of partitions historically up to the above quiescence point. Write to the same S3 partitions you created in 1.4. Run a thread pool and your custom application code to query it in parallel and make it look pretty on your dashboard of choice. This is embarrassingly parallel up to the number of partitions you created.All these fancy technologies like dbt, Kafka, Airflow, dagster, etc are complex solutions to non problems.

It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.**Is it important for data to get into the \"warehouse\" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \\-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. **As for your questions:** 1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. 2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. 3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. 5. We see folks mostly running materialized views, but admittedly we have less visibility here.",

When you were using Aurora as the landing zone, did you use a workflow tool **(**dbt, Airflow, or Glue**)** to extract and transform the data before loading it into Redshift?2. Now that you're using S3 as the landing zone, how are you achieving near real-time delivery to Redshift? I'm aware that Redshift isn't ideal for frequent small inserts, so I'd love to hear how you're handling that part.",

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.Hope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",

The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. In other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests. Breakage was fine and normal and planned for and dealt with accordingly. Here, breakage is seen as catastrophic... Yet we don't spend time engineering against it.",

Ideally whatever BI tools they're feeding data to at a minimum, plus whatever BI (or BI like) tooling they use to monitor their own pipelines and performance. Knowing these tools is especially handy when someone tells you that you broke their pipeline, but it's actually a problem between the keyboard and chair on their end.*Must* they? No, especially where there may be actual people available who do know those tools. Big teams allow for specialisation, small teams require generalisation. Knowing *a* tool but not the one used in your org is a bit pointless. Knowing the tools your business uses is great. Having a comprehensive knowledge of several BI tools might be an indicator someone is either bullshitting on their CV, or they've moved around a lot.",

As in even the team there has no capability to do a data dump, which is BS, but whatever. I also did a deep dive for anything related to web-scraping and I think I'm safe. There are restrictions on trying to test vulnerabilities of the site and accessing data that isn't your own, and I think it's the only option I have at this point unless I want to spend the rest of my career clicking links.

Normally, the hierarchy would be defined in the OPC UA server, which would provide a template for you to use. So, the first option is to manually define the node mapping with the full path, second and probably best option, use tags for grouping with the bracketed notation config. This is still something that I want to try out.2. This is a continuous process but should be similar for batching processes. You would monitor the same process tags at the end of the day. You can add additional tags to the data to add batch specific info - maybe using a processor plugin like starlark or even a Python plugin in InfluxDB. 3.

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? - What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? - Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? Generally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.Personally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",

        "body": "> it's taking longer than I *feel* it should takeGZip compression isn't inherently \"splittable\" (mentioned already by another), because it doesn't provide a way to 'jump ahead' in the data and know where you are to start decompressing. This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.If you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read themThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.---There are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.Uploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.A potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.Another *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.The best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s \"COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\"`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",

The video format is extremely easy to digest, and the pacing is excellent.I've had the Nand2Tetris book for a while, but it's really hard to justify spending the time it will take to work through it these days.

He also created a [fantastic digital logic simulator](https://limeinc.itch.io/digital-logic-sim2) (on itch.io), which I've been using to learn about computers in my spare time. He also has a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim) of the [itch.io](http://itch.io) sim which you can fork and modify/build it yourself.My current project related to that is writing a Python script to do the Quine-McCluskey algorithm on a truth table to give the smallest logical representation of that truth table. I'm loving that project because it's my first time doing recursion in a way that makes sense to me (and I'm not using AI for anything except google-type questions, mostly related to the Python slice operator \\[::\\], because I can't seem to wrap my head around it).Anyway, great post.",

It's great but you will find yourself relying on it so you won't be able to write code without it * Ask the AI to really explain the theory behind the answers it gives you. It can hallucinate but when it comes to code, it knows a lot, especially if you are learning a commonly used language.* Related: don't just copy the code it gives you.

        "body": "I have thought about this a lot lately. I disagree with you when it comes to students. They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I. A.I. destroys your ability to think. It may not happen immediately, but it does. I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time. This isn't just happening to programmers. This is happening to other fields as well. The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it. Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool. It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning. This is also why you take so many math classes. Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills. The same goes for programmingI'm speaking from experience on this. I'm a 3rd year CS student. My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class. Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion. Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I. I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer. I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps. I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again. I actually retained the information that time.I have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code. I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects. This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design. Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity. I would love for someone to tell me how they did that if they don't know how to code.",

For example, accessing the first item in an array. It doesn’t matter how many elements are in the array, it always takes the same amount of time.O(n): linear time. This describes behavior that scales linearly as the input gets bigger. For example, printing each element in an array. As the input grows, so does the time.O(n²): quadratic time. This usually shows up when you have nested loops (a loop inside a loop) both running over the same input. For example, comparing every element in an array to every other element. The time it takes to complete a nested loop structure increases more and more as the input grows, even more than linearly.",

Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING. Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm. Those numbers can be similar or very different.You are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION. The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result. Eg array\\[user\\_input\\] = 0; you go there, you do something, you are done. Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing. You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.O(N) is similar. you iterate an array and add 5 to each element. How many times did you add 5? Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say... that is abstracted to the letter \"N' which just means \"some amount of them\". You write that one O(N), see how that works?looping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen? Its N\\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ... right? And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\\^2).So the notation is O (some expression of N). some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot. Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\\^3 + 11n\\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\\^3) .. because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\\-------------------a log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part. I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers. 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2. How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half? Even rounding it up.. 50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done. Hmm. 2\\^7 is... 128. Hmm. See the connection? The math problem is \"to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100\". The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target. THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2. No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer. Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully? All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again... is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ... cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). That is about 85% of the big o stuff. There will be other notations at the same time that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.there are not that many REAL in use big-O answers. There is 1, lg(n), N\\*lg(n), N, N\\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\\^N etc. And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\\^3 or better). I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\\^(x+1/x)) eg N\\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm. But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students. You won't see that kind of mess most likely, or if you do, they will just give you the answer and tell you (indirectly) that it was a pain to figure that out.",

Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.For example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: for i in range(len(nums) - 1): for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)): if nums[i] + nums[j] == target: return [i, j]It has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \\* n times, hence O(n\\*\\*2) time complexity.An optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: prev_numbers = {} for i, num in enumerate(nums): complement = target - num if complement in prev_numbers: return [prev_numbers[complement], i] prev_numbers[num] = iIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.Another common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.Look up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject. Don't just rely on a single course or tutorial.",

Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.Like, look at some pseudo code like: function maxproduct(List l): int { int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0 while (i < l.length) { while ( i + j < l.length) { int product = l[i] * l[i+j] if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product j++ } i++ } return maxproduct }If the list contains 1 item, how many times will the \"`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\\]\" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?If you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.But if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",

I know the hard part sometimes can be picking a project and feeling internally motivated to do it, so here’s a suggestion. Pick a topic and act like you’re taking a course on it. If you need to, just latch onto the first project you see on the subject that way the choosing part of the project doesn’t prevent you from the *doing* part of the project. Worst case scenario, try to recreate a project you saw on YouTube or something. Even if you break things, that’s better than nothing. Ask your classmates, professors, or even Reddit for help when you’re stuck. The key here is that you just need to DO it. Don’t be afraid to do it wrong or accidentally make your machine catch on fire.Edit: I would like to add that you should always start small. Programming a microcontroller? In my classes, we always started with a program called “stop-go”; when the microcontroller turns on, there’s a red LED on. When you press a button, the red LED turns off and a green LED turns on. Programming an application? Okay, maybe figure out how to make a window for a GUI. It doesn’t have to do anything other than be a program. Make pong or Notepad. Reinvent that wheel.",

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof? It sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. \"So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?\" The secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness. Identifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second. The thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table. With that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table. Further, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.* I hope this helps you feel better.",

You will make mistakes; your code may look ugly and incoherent, but as you gain experience, you find out what is important and understandable to you. AI takes away parts of the thinking process; usually, you have to iterate on a problem to fit your needs and liking.Without knowing your skill level, I would advise you to revisit some of your previous exercises and redo them on your own, with less help. Start small and progress slowly (the key is that the exercises should challenge your knowledge and assumptions). You may extend the exercises with made-up additional tasks, and you may explore alternative solutions to the problem. You may use AI to generate problem descriptions or to clarify problem statements, just note that you may get some weird responses from AI.",

Start with pencil and paper. Sit down. Read the problem statement multiple times. Break it down into sub-problems. Break the sub problems further down. Then, solve each of the sub problems individually, as *you*, the person, would. Track down the steps. Check the steps against some sample input.

Under no circumstances use it to do your thinking, to give you solutions, to give you code. Do not copy-paste code from somewhere else. Type it yourself.Learning programming requires effort. Learning programming requires practice. You need to come up with your own solutions. You need to struggle. You need to fight. You need to fail. You need to solve.

I try as hard as possible to stay within strict typing and view weak typing as a curse and a crutch.But that’s me. I’m not a web developer, I’ve always been more interested in embedded systems or high-performance code designed to run within restricted resources.Functional programming abstracts too much of the control flow aspect for me to rely on it. When I write code I am thinking about data as real data stored on a medium or memory being accessed and modified. OOP allows me to effectively model and interact with data with several strict guidelines enforced along the way. This is obviously possible with any paradigm but OOP simply gets the job done best for me.When I don’t use OOP I use heavily packed structures and end up attempting to implement similar behavior.",

As a simple example, in C and C++, there is a preprocessor step, and there is nothing like that in Python. It is not a \"huge\" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.Another peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default. You must \"opt in\" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being \"virtual\" or \"non-virtual\", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.C++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.C++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.Python also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, \"generators\" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an \"eval\" facility which lets you evaluate code \"on the fly\" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",

Moreover, if you try to switch from a high-level (abstraction-oriented) language such as Python to a low-level (system-oriented) language such as Rust or C++, you will have to learn a lot of additional theoretical material such as memory management and data mutation safety rules.

        "body": "Ok, I've re-read your question and now I think that you are actually asking how to use your skills to build a portfolio of projects that will help you get hired as Software Engineer.So - I think it depends on the hiring person (unfortunately) and varies from company to company.With that beeing said: I was doing hiring for engineering jobs for a while.When I assesed a candidate I liked seeing various projects on their github. Even if half-baked. This is because actually finishing the project is VERY hard, but what I always valued is the tinkerer approach. Of course I'd also talk with them about this to further understand if they are in-fact a tinkerer or just cosplaying as one.I just like working with this kinds of people. If you are aiming for FAANG then... remember all the alghorithms that you'll only use once a year when doing Advent of Code I guess? //EDITED **Previous content of this comment**:People pay for things they need.Figure out what people need and you'll be rich!This is a bit sarcastic (sorry!) to draw your attention to the fact that the question you are asking is the question the whole business world asks constantly! (with various outcomes) It's not about your technical skills at all. If you don't feel comfortable with handling the business side, invoices, clients and such stuff then easier route would be to simply get a job as a software engineer :) If you are determined I'll suggest first leveling up your \"business-related/product-related\" skills.",

I also use Googles Gemini API to have AI in my app. It analyzes my finances and gives me a report on what I do good and maybe not so good and what I could do better.Working on something that you yourself will use for a long time is not only incredibly fun and rewarding but will also automatically teach you things.

This subreddit isn't called learnCoding either, it's called learnProgramming.IMHO what sets a programmer apart from a coder is that a programmer is capable of understanding (software) architecture decisions in their programming field (and maybe even make their own architecture decisions). A mobile app developer has learned the architecture layers of mobile apps, a backend enterprise application programmer has learned how to keep their growing projects maintainable, a frontend dev may know a thing or two about designs, ... .So what can you do? Understand that coding is one of many means at a programmer's disposal to achieve something greater. Then get a grasp on which field(s) of programming actually interest you.If you like coding, which usually involves breaking down a larger problem into many small steps, you can think of programming as doing the same \"breaking down problems\" into manageable chunks, just at a grander scale. Trust me, it's just as fulfilling to see planned parts of a program work well together as it is to write individual methods that do what they are supposed to do.If you still have absolutely no idea what to do, maybe think of a more-than-trivial, less-than-difficult business use-case and implement that into a program with an agile development style. A business use-case doesn't have to be money oriented, it can be anything you'd use in a business, including any open-source software idea that comes to your mind.While/after you get the right mindset how to approach program development, you can return to game development. If you do it right it'll probably involve having/obtaining some math knowledge that you aren't thinking of yet, which is why IMHO business applications are a tad more approachable if you just want to get the right mindset regarding project work, while doing some goal-oriented coding.",

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. It’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. If you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. Furthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. A way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output.

Try Vim (nvim with something like NvChad, or just try the Vim plugin for VSCode and get a taste for it). It is so much fun once you’ve got the basics down. It is worth it just for convenience on its own.This is my recommendation if u are serious about getting a job in this field as getting to know git linux and maybe even vim can help you get a foot hold.",

Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\", meaning basically that we should worry about correctness and simplicity first, otherwise we will end up wasting all our time/shooting ourselves in the foot.2. The correct approach is to first have a working program/code/feature, and then assess whether the performance even is problematic, and then if it is, use profiling or instrumentation to see which part of the code is slow and why. Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.4. I don't really think it's realistic to be able to write thing fast and efficient \"in the first draft\" as you say, it sort of goes against everything else I wrote here. That being said, depending on what kind of code you are writing, if you have a general understanding of basic algorithms like sorting and searching and so on, along with time complexity, maybe you can build some muscle for doing this just at a basic level. But I would not encourage you to try to optimize things at the system level in the first draft because usually it's more trouble than it's worth.",

I'm more focused on the quality of the interfaces/organization of the code units and how the mental model is reflected in the code, etc. Not focusing on speed first helps me to only compromise the design in areas where it's truly necessary due to identified performance issues.Usually when I do wind up fixing performance issues in my code, it usually comes in the form of caching. Has its tradeoffs. Sometimes I'm also able to change things to avoid garbage collection running as often or at inopportune moments. Rarely, I'll have to do something like replacing recursion with a loop. Rarely, I need to change data structures or the way data is fetched (this matters but I just rarely make mistakes with this on the first draft.)",

Develop a good intuition for complexity (as in Big O) so you can make snap judgements about how catastrophic performance will be in a loop or whatever. Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. 2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput. Think about how fast this needs to go and how often and how much data it's working on so that you're aware of how much you need to be thinking about #1. Like sometimes my brain has some complaint about a n\\^2+ array operation, but I also realize the array is only every like 10 items and it doesn't matter, readability dominates the considerations. Other times I have to pull down 6 or 7 figures worth of database rows and do some heavy shit to them, and now I'm thinking pretty hard about how to streamline, filter, cache, batch, etc.",

I started with that as well as C. This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java. It's all good stuff to know, but certainly not a requirement. If anything, can make you really appreciate everything these higher level languages are doing for you.",

Starts directly in the browser and later moves to Visual Studio Code (with full setup instructions).The course is top quality, targeted at absolute beginners and is a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\" that will not only teach you the Python programming language, but also *programming*.Sign up, log in, go to part 1 and start learning.Yes, it will be hard. Yes, it will be difficult. If you want to achieve something, you will have to bite through.Learning programming is not a sprint.

Then learn Java/Kotlin. Do you want to develop websites? Learn javascript. Do you want to develop operating systems/embedded systems? Learn C/C++. Scripting or task automation? Go with python. Keep in mind that once you have learned the general principles of programming (i.e learn to think like a programmer), learning a new language is very easy, because basically the only thing that changes is the syntax, and some quirks that each language may have, but the core concepts are always the same. Python is a good generic starting language to learn programming concepts because its syntax is not complex, and it has libraries for everything you might want to do. As for resources, I would suggest first using youtube tutorials/books to learn about different concepts (variables, operators, functions, classes, etc.), then figuring out what the best language is for your use case, and trying to solve leetcode challenges. Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization. Another alternative for when you get decent is to choose an open-source project that you like from github and try to contribute to it, in order to learn about integration and work with real-world systems. Try to fix some easy bugs, update the documentation, run unit tests, etc.",

It's your brain literally rewiring itself to think logically. Don't give up yet. Give it at least 2-3 weeks of consistent practice before you decide anything. Python usually clicks around week 3-4 for most people, but everyone's different.About whether you should continue, programming skills are pretty valuable right now, especially with AI stuff happening. Even if you don't become a full time developer, knowing how to code helps in almost any field.As for next language, worry about that later. Get comfortable with Python first. Maybe after 6 months you can think about JavaScript or something else.You're not wasting time, just being realistic about the learning curve.

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.Once you’ve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.This is one of the fundamental ideas in programming. Computers work largely by repeating simple sets of instructions, very very quickly, with different data.",

Even in certain fields , it is sometimes better to use something else entirely than the standard.However, there are some rules to the exceptions: 70% (or more) of enterprise software is written in Java. Python is really good in prototyping and creating quick scripts that can fix smaller problems without trying to change the whole architecture. Sorry that this doesn't provide any answer, but it's really depends on the situation at hand. Learn the concepts, and what is left are the syntax and architecture the languages can use for the best. If you are somewhat adept at coding as a whole, you will see many repetitive patterns when we talk about imperative paradigms. Tldr: learn concepts and architectures as a whole and be flexible.

Then rinse and repeat. I was tired of just copy pasta tutorial videos and then not being able to recall anything. Now I can print “Hello, World!” with confidence :)I eventually plan to go back at the end when I finish the whole tutorial/lesson/class on what I’m watching (like 4-8hrs of said programming language) to refactor and make all the lessons and mini projects code to be more efficient. And that’s in hopes of refreshing concepts as I clean the code getting some hands on experience, even if not crazy complex.An example: at the end of my current YouTube class/lesson, or maybe in the middle when topic is touched, I plan to somehow create an array or some data structure to be able to rotate my lessons/miniprojects to run and output instead of hard coding each function I want to run. If that makes sense. So I’d implement concepts I learn with my own notes.",

I have a file alongside each project outlining exactly what’s going on as I work on the project. 1) explain the concept, goals, success factors and a note on what I might need and what I want to learn2) I usually have a design drawn out separately but I’ll write a brief summary of how I intend it to work, classes that will be used and key methods or functions. 3) start a diary for each day or section. This is handy for showing what I was working on and how I approached it but also good practice for getting back into it quicker and having a clear view of where you are in the projectYou don’t have to be working on something new each day. Your having trouble with something explain it (you might find the answer while you talk through it), show each approach you went through and if you have to go back and change something earlier in the project hilight it and make a note on that entry incase you go back to check it. Again not every day needs to have an entry, just add onto the end on the one you’re working on if it’s a continuation. 4) At the end write a summary of how the project went. You successfully created x which did y and z. These are the things that tripped me up. This is how I got around it. This is what I’d do differently going forwardAnd these are things I’d like to improve. It seems like a lot of work at the start but it makes it way easier to track what’s going on and you can see find stuff easier when you’re looking back for solutions in the future. I probably should call it something other than notes.txt so it stands out in the future but it’s a good trace of how you work and proof you actually did it.",

Much of our work is to translate real-world problems into suitable data structures and algorithms and then implement them. We also have known \"design patterns\" and \"software architecture patterns\" that can help us when we design different systems (they also give us a common vocabulary that we can use when reasoning about different solutions). It is not that you \"must\" learn DSA to know how to write programs, but it will probably enrich your knowledge base, enhance your problem-solving skills, and give you an understanding of the performance implications of different data structures and algorithms.Having a \"side project\" is orthogonal to learning about different programming concepts. Having your own project allows you to challenge your assumptions of how things work, put into practice what you have learned (and learn even more from your own mistakes).You may check the FAQ (in the sidebar); it has, for example, a section on different exercises and project ideas that can be helpful.",

There are easier ways to do that.The answer still is personal projects. Data structures and containers are much better to learn when considering your project's requirements and tailoring them to fit it, than memorizing different types of data structures and containers while having no clue about how and when they would actually be best to use over the alternatives. And conclusions you reach on your own you will memorize and internalize much better than conclusions you reach because a book told you that that's how it works, which might or might not even be correct.",

He told me to chose one and I chose websites.

Find what works and what does not work, make them better in either design or functionality.I did that for a few sites, one day it clicked and I got comfortable with building and designing sites from scratch.

You’ll learn more that way. And be motivated by user delight.",

I must not have kept a streak for more than week, I didn’t care about that. I’d just keep going from where I had stopped. I made a few friends through the challenge and it was quite fun to have people pushing you to learn more and share knowledge. Your skill level doesn’t really matter either. Some people will post about learning how to use some CSS command, and some people are making microchips with VHDL or making neural networks from scratch. The point of the challenge is for you to spend time studying something related to code that interests you, whatever it might be.",

If you are relying on your own motivation to learn, you should try to seek balance when possible to avoid tipping the delicate balance between super motivated and enthusiastic and overwhelmed or burnt out. Don’t worry too much about the future and switching over permanently, just live in the moment and try to learn as much web dev as possible. After all, the more you learn, the more prepared you are to answer this question yourself",

The sooner that you get your hands dirty with bash, and struggle past errors until they're familiar, the better. Switching to macOS helped me with moving closer to Linux, but grabbing a cheap laptop from Facebook marketplace and installing a dozen different Linux distros will get you further and faster. I suggest using a separate machine so you can go scorched earth.**No** because you should stick with whatever you're comfortable moving forward with. People may give up over the tiniest things. DO NOT accidentally kill your interest in programming by changing your environment so much that you lose faith in your foundations. Edit: Forgot to mention that WSL is pretty good right now. When I'm forced to suffer through Windows I tend to use Git Bash for simple operations and WSL for anything that Git Bash can't handle. These days Git Bash for windows has the option to install a bunch of command-line tools that make life on Windows a bit more linux-like. Can't live without it.",

If they're already really good, you may have some opportunities in an IT role to flex them a bit.Finally, it sounds like you'll have at least one other opportunity to get a fully dev-focused role. This will likely be easier when you have both some work experience under your belt and another year of school.",

The first internship is rarely a dream job. Nevertheless, once you are on an actual job, opportunities might present themselves to get some light programming done for your company on your free time: small utilities, data conversion tasks, app scripting, etc. that will look good on your resume. Perhaps ask your internship contact whether something like that is likely to be possible. That's what happened to me: I was tasked with just data entry, but I saw the need for an extensive database of all companies in the NYC tri-state area for the data entry personnel, so I purchased a then CD-ROM -based business directory with appropriate data, wrote a custom utility in C++ to convert over a million records into a flat-file database format used by the company, converted all the data on my home PC and handed that huge chunk of data to my boss. He was very impressed and even gave me a monetary bonus.",

Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. \"15326\" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.Good luck on the exam!",

Those help, and certainly when you're flooded with applicants you can throw resumes in the trash that don't have the technologies you're looking for, but that's an early filter. (which technologies get you past those early filters? that is location dependent as you've already intuited - the only way to know for you area is to check local job boards)Another early filter is \"do they have a 4 year degree in CS?\" You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.But the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.Not every interview is going to have a \"whiteboard coding\" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",

        "body": "Hey! Recruiter in the tech space (building a tech talent community to upskill + place talent) here, and I work with a lot of junior devs trying to break into the job market. Entry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.What I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! Some things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! And finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too). If you're interested, here's our website: [https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad](https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad)I hope this helps & feel free to ask any more questions!",

Etc. this is a very simple example but even in work now when I have to make an algorithm or aggregate/manipulate data I will break it down as much as possible to make things simpler to digest mentally.After a while of doing this you will begin to see patterns, and then you will look at coding basically as pattern recognition and this will speed up the problem solving process.As far as tracing code, just read each line carefully and follow the flow of what it does.",

That is, read a book like \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" and see the kinds of \"boring problems\" are being automated there. Then do something similar for your own needs, or customize one of the examples there to add features to it or to make it more to your tastes.I recently had an issue where I wanted to put some music (e.g. 50 files) on a cheap MP3 player, but the \"artist\" tag was too long to display properly in the \"choose artist\" screen of the player. So, I wrote a Python script to open each one, change the Id3 tag for the artist using a rule I defined (to make it shorter but still legible on the player), and then save it.This was not a genius script by any means, but to me, writing something like this is 100x more rewarding than solving a \"leetcode\" problem. Will anyone else care about the code I wrote? Probably not; I didn't design it to be a general purpose tool. If I put it on GitHub it would receive exactly 0 stars and 0 forks for example (probably I would post it as a \"gist\" if I posted it at all), but I didn't write it to get points or something, I wrote it to solve \\*my\\* particular problem and it was fun to write.

The more you learn about a languages the more you realize that you will only ever know a pin drop and never be a 'master' of it. It's good that you have taken on a role for now, but I'd just set a time limit for interview prepping and just start applying for jr roles when they happens. The industry is a bit rough getting into right now, so more exposure to interviews won't be a bad thing. Flunk a few bad opportunities and be more prepared when a good role comes along.",

The time which is challenging to do in the work , so that in the back of your mind , u always have a goal to do things in a natural way and not get deviated by random thoughts.If u have not given it a fixed time , it is basically infinite,so if u can never say that the work is complete. You see? We can never complete a work without deadline.Setting a deadline or giving a fixed time makes it look unimportant after that which helps you to complete it within that time bound.Even if it is 10 hours or 1 hour or just 30 minutes.

        "body": "Can you give an example?Generally, it's a separate skill. Teaching as a TA or tutor helps practice; so does a client facing job like consulting. My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.My other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.It's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.I will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like \"I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \\[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\\].\" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird. Show you know the first principle or pattern and can learn new things.",

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.The way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a \"good job candidate\" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's \"obvious\" in the sense that you should \"just know\", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.After that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up \"X interview questions\". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.And beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems. That ultimately meant I was bad at doing coding interviews, and I had to swallow my pride and work through neetcode before I got to a good spot with coding interviews.Edit: I also verbalize everything when I interview prep. I'm not a naturally good speaker, so I try to talk through everything to be good enough for interviews. It's important to not talk too \"hastily\" though, you typically want to talk like you're trying to hold a conversation.",

For learning C, check out books like Modern C or K&R. For learning systems, check out courses/materials online. I recommend Nand2Tetris, it’s a wonderful resource. There’s no reason you can’t learn C and learn systems at the same time, but it helps to have some familiarity with how C works before diving into a really complex systems project like an OS kernel",

As long as you're aware of that, though, and have the instinct to check something with primary sources or \"up to date\" references that needs to be checked, I don't think this is as much of a problem as some people seem to make it out to be.Next, you cannot do common computing tasks on a book like \"Search\" (at least not in a print version). But for this, there is \"the table of contents\" and \"the index\" which may seem quaint but are actually better for learning, in my opinion. If you go to the index to find a term, for example, then your eyes will encounter other related terms and you'll naturally want to look up a few more and to increase your knowledge.Personally I like the feeling of holding a book and flipping through pages. At least, to me it feels a lot more enjoyable than scrolling through pages on a screen. Maybe it's just because I use a computer for work so much, that doing something on the computer (looking at document) feels like \"work\", whereas looking at a book on paper (even about programming) feels like not work, even if some aspects of a physical book are more laborious, such as flipping pages or finding the correct page number.",

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!Books have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.Interactive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend \"finish\" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you \"learned\" before the course is complete.Video tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.My recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution. Then you are learning!",

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.Picking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.It depends on the problem. Probably more than half of coding problems would be just as easy in C.",

Currently I am not aware of your future plans. i.e :- If you want a new job in an another field of programming , If you want are currently preparing for an interview or are planning to do so.So, simple stuff, you said you made games, you can start from there, maybe study more DSA (or from the start if you believe you hadn't understood a thing.)2. Depends on what YOU want. Skillset or More Money from levelling up what your job requires.If you have the same interest as the thing you work, that's the cherry in top. If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.Also, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die. It's natural to get overwhelmed and fell lost but don't,my friend, it's a long journey.Also please don't try to learn everything at the same time, like you metioned java, 5 other things, first master one thing and then move on the other.3. You can use AI to either make you an intellectual or completely destroy your brain, depends on how you use it. ONLY use it when you are stuck on a problem or a bug for a few 20 minutes. AI doesn't destroy anyone, they let AI destroy them, it has been the best thing that happened to me because I used it responsibly.This was my answer, believe me , thing will get better, you WILL overcome the doubts you have, just believe in yourself,good luck and ALL OF THE BEST BROTHER, YOU CAN DO IT.",

Work on a project, encounter problems, fix the problems.>Any good projects or tutorials you’d recommend for practicing?Any project that you personally care about and are motivated by. And it's far more useful if you work on it yourself instead of just copying it from some book or video. >Or even just personal experiences — what helped it all *click* for you?First, figure out the properties of your problem, and then find a solution that best fits those properties. Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. I think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them. Eventually, you might encounter a debugging session that frustrates you, and you might then realize that the use of SOLID would have avoided you the headache. It's hard to internalize these things without experiencing that frustration concretely first.",

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

If you never encounter a “problem” in an OOP language code base. You will have no idea how OOP concept will solve those problems. The easier way to move forward is find a project or build one NOT using an OOP. Once you build to certain level, stop and look at how your code wired together.

Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.Now the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.Once you understand this, it makes a lot more sense. The IoC takes care of the construction of the object, and everything else is OOD.",

You can translate something like result = switch x case 3: x+1 case 6: x-1 case 1: 0 default: 42to data Case a b = Case a b data Default b = Default b result = switch x [ Case 3 $ x+1 , Case 6 $ x-1 , Case 1 0 ] (Default 42) switch :: (Eq a) => a -> [Case a b] -> Default b -> b switch _ [] d = d switch x (Case x' bod : rest) d = if x == x' then bod else switch x rest d(I haven't done Haskell in a few years so I may be off on some of the syntax but I think it's somewhat understandable) (Note how this implementation relies on lazy evaluation; more generally you might wanna insert lambdas for the bodies of the different cases)",

It's more similar to a ternary operator than an if statement, just less cryptic.You can also do pattern matching on function arguments; for example, if a function takes a list, you can do foo :: [a] -> b -- function type declaration foo (firstelem:rest) = -- something that splits off the first element and does whatever with the rest foo _ = -- something that is evaluated when the first pattern isn't met (ie, the list is empty and there is no first element to split off)(anything after `--` is a comment in Haskell)Monads/Functors/Applicatives can also be used for flow control; effectively, you can execute a function on an input only if everything upstream didn't encounter issues.",

A consulting company usually wouldn't care how you accomplish a task as long as it works. A product based software company will usually demand more as they have invested a lot of effort and resources in that product.> Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.A common pitfall many new devs fall into. Do you really need to understand everything about everything? Don't get me wrong, I want to differentiate between you wanting to know how HTTP server works architecture wise and you feeling like you have to know how HTTP server works. One serves to broaden and enhance your skills while the other only serves to impede you.> If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?It depends on what you are trying to understand. Do you want to know if it is possible to do a task using a particular concept? Sure, you can implement messaging between two clients using BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) by following a YT video. Do you want know the limits of what you can do with BLE? You then go and read the RFC for BLE, learn about it's specs, versions etc.TL;DR:- Both approaches are fine, it all depends on what you want. Want to get something done and don't really care for implementation details, go for application over mastery. Want to know what is possible and what isn't? Go for mastery over application.",

Let's say you started with a to-do app. Things that would actually be \"complex\" might include:* Hierarchical list, like items within other items, with collapse/expand* The ability to select multiple items and apply an action to all of them* Real-time sync between different devices* Sync that works even if one device is offline for a while* Share your to-do list with others, with options for read-only or collaborate* Push notifications / reminders when things are dueThose are just ideas. The important thing is that some of those features are tricky, and the more of them you add the more complex your product becomes, and that's what makes it much more like a real product and impressive.Now of course I also want it clean and polished and efficient - but it has to have some complexity to it first.",

        "body": "I'll give 3 I can think of. Or 2.5, maybe.1) Honestly I'd already learned most of the important lessons the hard way before hearing advice around them. One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.3) Some advice I got but debatably not \"software engineering\" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like \"we can't do that\" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like \"Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?\"In other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.I think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.So I would say to your \"but I wonder if there's more\", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",

And then again, and again, and again, until finally something snaps.*\"Just one more feature man! Just one more! Please man! One more, then I'll stop, promise! I need just one more feature!\"*No. Fuck that. Not gonna happen. Too many projects, industry and FOSS, die because of feature creep, because codebases bloat- and then blow-up.And people don't prevent it, because a yes-man seems to have an easier time getting ahead in his career than someone saying no, because coporate shills and useless consultants have poisoned modern corporate culture portraying saying \"No\" as something evil.----*\"Any methodology becomes useless when it becomes an ideology.\"*This is true for everything, but by far the worst offenders of this in programming, are OOP, TDD, FP, and early optimization. The fetishization of \"memory safety\" that some acolytes of a certain language that shall remain unnamed are carrying before them like a holy relic, is a close runner up.All of these are useful. All of these have their place. All of these absolutely have the ability to kill productivity, burn out teams, and crash entire projects when driven to extremes.So when someone says \"Write the test before the code\" or \"We should really rewrite this in oxidized iron\", ask them why, and if their answer smells like something a missionary would say to trick people into coming to church, its better not to listen.",

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.The idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead. Also have a look at r/csharp. If you've got c# questions it's a more specialised community",

The whole \"use a thesaurus to avoid repeating yourself\" thing that English majors do in prose is actively frowned upon in comp-sci works. If you mean the same thing, use the same word again.Also what happens in real settings is that rarely used words are just not as present as other vocab, so we either need to think for a bit (either to mentally translate or to search for the word) and this is bloody exhausting. Just reusing the smaller core vocab is kind of a defence mechanism then.> Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges.

        "body": "So the problem with freelancing is that it's not a good fit when you have no experience.People who hire freelancers don't know what they need. The most common request isn't \"build me a simple website\", it's \"somebody built me this complex website 5 years ago and it broke, can you fix it?\".It's much harder to fix something than to build it. You have no idea what language or framework it might use, or what the person who originally wrote it was thinking.Experienced programmers who have done a little of everything are great at stuff like that. They can make good money because they can quickly figure it out and solve the problem in a few hours. Meanwhile a junior programmer might spend a week just figuring out how it works.So yeah - early in your career it's usually the best move to get a full time job so you can gain experience and learn from other programmers. Once you're more skilled, freelancing or consulting or starting a business are totally options.A lot of us do stick with employment, though, because it pays really well with less risk.",

You could potentially always outsource other devs to cover your weak points, because in order for you to succeed, you would need to specialize, but sales, marketing and unique selling point + exceptional product is how you can stand out. My main point is that just knowing how to create a website is not enough. If that would be the case, every dev would run their own agency. So it's doable, but it's hard. Business is hard, period, no matter what you choose to do.P.S. Also, don't ask devs about business side of things, they're clueless. It's impossible for your friend, becuase he lacks business skillset, he's a dev.",

        "body": "First off if you are in Russia you already have problems that can't be addressed here but will impact your ability to earn a living.If I understand your question correctly the answer is NO you can't just jump into freelance work with no education nor training. To get more specific there is a very wide range of what could be considered web site development some or which requires little in the way of programming skill to that which requires a team for timely delivery. The no skill web sites are often the low pay web sites you can't live off.As I see it and the big problem I have with your post, is that you don't want to learn and become a professional, this is a huge problem. If you really want to go into business for yourself you need a 4 year degree in some CS discipline. That degree should contain a minor in business management. You simply will not be able to compete for the lucrative jobs with targeted education. So you really need to address your position on education, if you are not willing to get a college degree in a CS program then you should consider something else. Maybe basket weaving.So back to your very first question, \"can a programmer work for himself\". You certainly can but you need to have developed the skill set before you go out on your own. Even then you need to know the technology on a professional level. People that do this sort of thing, that is create their own companies have personality characteristics that allow them to be successful. You have to be driven and frankly wear many hats. One of those hats is customer relations and that is a lot harder than many imagine. In business for yourself you are not just a programmer, you need to come off as a professional that can grasp the potential customers needs. If you come off as a flunky that took a Python course and thinks he is a GOAT then you will have a hard time even drumming up business.",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.Being able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"You have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.It definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

If there are designers, they will take care of most UX/design thinking, but you do get to participate and offer suggestions.Designers often work out of figma or similar apps, which don’t really behave exactly like a browser, so they do need the programmers help. Designers also often expect people to behave predictably, and there always those ppl who don’t. I happen to have degrees in both engineering and graphic design and can tell you: if you enjoy coding , FE will be your cozy niche. If you enjoy creating the visual interface and interactions, but coding in general bores you, stick with graphic design.I CAN do some BE in Java, but it bores the hell out of me because it’s so predictable and stable and mostly boilerplate. Which is why I have never gone fullstack, and will continue to avoid it hopefully until I retire. FE is chaotic and I love it. It’s always new, every interface has its own problems to solve, ready-made component libraries only get you so far and sometimes they introduce more problems than they solve, and that one goal of less than 2 seconds to page fully loaded really keeps me going. Doing a website with React is easy, keeping those page loads under control is priceless.",

In school you had a set schedule for classes. They didn’t do that because it was nice to look at. They didn’t it because it works. Even if a 14yo student didn’t want to do maths this week they still had 4 hours in class. Now you need to set those restrictions on yourself. You might have so many online lectures already set out but you need to structure your time around them and plan your evenings to fit in the homework (prescribed or self assigned) ensuring the info sticks. Clear your study environment so it only relates to study. No games trinkets or toys just what you need to work. You can add some bits later to decorate (months or years later) but start fresh and get everything set up for your mindset. When I’m sitting here I’m studying. Set out a plan. You want to learn Java make something in Java. Start with a concept:“I want to make a calorie tracker” what does it need? Calorie calculator, database to record entries, GUI, mobile app, are we going to have multiple users?That’s a lot to plan and make in one go so let’s break it down into each component and make the calculator first, next let’s focus on making multiple entries for one day so the app gives you daily totals, now we need to display different meals through the day and process what each one had, next let’s make a DB and record entries there so we can look back over a week (do we need a DB can we just make a file and read from that). Do some of the real planning they were trying to teach you in uni and design your own software architecture. In the morning I’m doing study on the stuff I missed 3 hours, take an hour break, evenings I’m doing project work 3 hours. You’ll have plenty of time for enjoying your summer besides. Treat it like a job and you’ll be ahead of everyone when you get back. They might have a year up but you can keep the project work going and have branch out skill to other areas giving you 3-4 large unique projects compared to the standard “every uni student” project. Avoid AI for the most part. Try to do it yourself, it’s hard but that’s exactly why you need to do it. AI can help guide your design choices after you’ve planned them. If you’re learning about arrays don’t switch to a list or hash map because the AI suggested it. Nail what you want first, then go back and make another project using more complex systems. Java isn’t that hard once you get going you can get into it fairly quick and projects are the best way to do that. When people say learn frameworks and libraries it’s really what tools you have and how you can use them. Best way to do that is with projects. Do your revision and get your studies back on track. Start building real projects and you’ll get a grip on what you need. Make the simple things first then bring them together. Sorry it’s so long but I think I needed to tell myself that as much as telling you:grinning_face_with_sweat:",

They also have employers that they partner with. It doesn’t guarantee a job but it’s companies that are willing to hire from the certification you get. And that’s like $400/ year. Personally this seems more about them making money than trying to help get a job. The limited class size and hurry to apply seems more like marketing pressure, especially when it’s immediately followed by “will your check clear”?",

What sqlite cannot do, is process multiple *WRITING* requests at the same time, as this requires exclusive access (either locking of the WAL (Write Ahead Log) or a pending db lock). sqlite does support multiple concurrent *READING* requests### WAL ModeSince WAL was introduced, if it is activated (by default sqlite uses the older rollback-journal), readers and writers do not block each other any more, and reading doesn't block other readers.So sqlite, with WAL enabled, supports multiple readers at the same time, and supports reading and writing at the same time. The only thing it doesn't support, is multiple writers at the same time, those are forced into sequential access, because they need to lock the WAL.https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html### Rollback JournalIn this mode, which is the default unless the journal pragma is set otherwise, sqlite still supports multiple readers and only one writer, but; other than with WAL, readers in this mode block writers, and vice versa.What this means (since sqlite version 3): If someone writes to the database, the DB goes into a `PENDING LOCK` mode...allowing current reads to finish, but disallowing further reads from the DB. As soon as the last read finishes, the database goes into `LOCKED` mode, the writing access does its thing, and then the lock clears.This means, with the older journal mode, if a lot of writes happen on a DB, read performance suffers.https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback",

I haven't seen any sqlite distribution that wasn't for a loooong time.Good code should check however, wether the sqlite compilate used supports this, and if it does, which thread safety mode it uses. The catch here is that there are 2 different modes:`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 1` means multi-threading is supported, but auto-serialized. This is slower, but safer.`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 2` means true multi-threading is supported, but there is no auto serialization. If this is the case, and in many sqlite distros this is the default now, *threads cannot safely use the same connection concurretly*. In this case, a connection-pool is usually the way to go if you have multiple threads accessing the DB.https://sqlite.org/compile.html#threadsafe",

(In SQLite, a \"connnection\" does not actually correspond to a network connection like in many other databases, but the terminology is the same.)Transactions are associated with particular connections, so you don't want to share a single connection between different user requests. Otherwise, one user would be able to see partial incomplete updates from another user's in-progress transaction.And locking happens at the granularity of connections, regardless of whether those connections are used in different processes, or different threads of the same process (as long as `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` is used, as you said). There can only be one *connection* writing to the DB at any given time.",

I want to be able to actually do my job after getting it. Nobody would even give me a second interview if I didn't talk up my senior/lead experience. I was being honest. I have some experience leading projects. I'm very comfortable with it. I am not a person with *years* of lead/senior level work, though, and that's what they wanted to hear.So I spent a few days running through the stories I had of my experience, and I rewrote them under the guise of *being* my tech lead. Same story, different angle. I know all the decisions we made on those projects, because I was a part of them. I didn't *make* the decisions, but now, in my stories, I did.I went from getting past recruiter screens 1/10 times to 10/10 times. It felt a lot more like interviewing 5 years ago. I still failed a lot of the later stages, but I don't care about having a 100% success rate. I only needed one job.If the rest of the market is lying, then you have to lie as well.

I think for that point it should be noted to not outright lie about things that can be verified (like schooling, certs, places you've worked, etc) however, embellishing your current (or immediate past) role is absolutely a must. Its important that you can speak confidently to that, however, so make sure you can answer questions about it at atleast an intermediate level in an interview setting.

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the \"but china\"-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant \"refunds\", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",

When you're growing, you need to hire a lot of people to take bit bets on many projects. You have to pay more and making interviewing less frictionful if you're hiring a lot of people. If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways. For startups and not yet profitable, growth companies, this makes it more financially challenging to operate. It also pushes them toward profitability and cost cutting, but this may not be viable for more growth-oriented business models.",

It's just like a verbal job offer, it's completely meaningless until the company makes it *formal*. That disclaimer is there for a reason. Because they can't actually make that promise to you right now.A lot of things can happen between now and the next promotion cycle. I can easily picture a scenaio where the promotion cycle arrives, they already got you to decline your other offer so they know they have their leverage back, and your boss goes \"Yeah... so... remember that 40% raise we were gnona give you? I talked to the higher ups, the best we can actually do now is 10%. Sorry. Next cycle I swear we'll treat you well\".You shouldn't have turned down their offer over a disclaimer'd counter like that.That being said, it is what it is. It's just business. Rescinding a verbal acceptance is never going to be a nice thing.... but if your boss actually cares about you as a person, they're going to be excited about your new journey. They'll probably be annoyed you rescinded, but they can be both annoyed and happy to see you happy.And if they're not? Well, nothing you do or say right now is gonna change that.You don't need any excuses, you don't need to explain yourself. \"I've thought about this more, and I believe this is the right career move for me\".",

What am I missing here? Are you close friends and worried about the friendship? Are you attracted to her and like being around her? I know it's just one reddit post, but absolutely nothing about what you say in your post makes your manager seem like she's \"truly the best\".I get that it's hard to leave familiarity behind, but either your manager really isn't that great, or you aren't advocating hard enough for yourself, or both. Doing extra work for one promotion and no raises over four years while being super underpaid the whole time, and then somehow magically she just scrounges up a 40%+ raise for you?, means it's time to go.My favorite manager who I left behind was just honest with me: you're great but we can't match that, we can barely do 5% raises this year much less 40%, best of luck, happy for you, you'll do great.Your manager's ability to suddenly advocate for you to the tune of 45% is super suspicious.",

Only exception would be on-call rotation, but even then I still go out and do things, I just don't do anything that would keep me from responding to an incident within the hour.And the amount of hours she works... jesus christ. I'm a 40-hour-a-week man. Even the crazy SWE's that work themselves into the ground are only logging 60-80 hours. That's like a vacation to this girl.And you know something else she recently complained to me about? Rampant misogyny in her workplace. Leadership that was making stupid calls, causing all sorts of scheduling drama impacting her hours, ruining the workplace, etc (she left that job over it).The *only* reason many medical professionals are working is out of passion. It's a miserable industry from what I hear. But they love it, they're helping people, they're saving lives, so their sacrifice *their own* life.But all the things you seem to be complaining about (minus passion) exists over in that world and then some.The grass is always greener.",

Take on the \"stetch\" project at work, ask your manager how to get promoted and follow through, do a masters, start mentoring, show up or start a programming meetup, launch your own product, grind LC for the hell of it, read books.I'm a career switcher, (data science/bioinformatics) that got my first SWE job in DEC '19. I've benefitted handsomely from the opportunities COVID bestowed upon us. What did I do? I finished a masters, I'm in a reading group on Databases/Distributed Systems/OS, I launched a start up and got a few users, et cetera.I know the baby is a lot, I know the house is a lot, but all you need to do is wake up each day, and move forward on work and learning. It won't make a difference this week, but in one month when you've read a few extra books, or in 6 months when your LC skills are sharp, or a year when you have a cool side project? You're experience will be on par with the best of them.You got this! You cannot be brave unless you are afraid?",

Somehow I settled on law and began planning a career move.But very quickly I realised it was the wrong choice. The law students I met seemed highly competitive and political, much more than any programmer I'd ever met, and there was a vague desperation to them. I read frank accounts of how numbing the work was and the crises of many lawyers who hit 40 and realise they're wasting their lives.I didn't leave technology in the end, I embraced it. I was looking for a career to fill holes in my self-image and try to counter my gnawing self-hatred. No job will do that. And I began to appreciate how creative I could be as a programmer once I accepted that I will never be perfect at it.Over the years I've become very thankful for this choice. Programming is what gets me up in the morning, there is nothing else like it for me. I will always be learning and it will never get boring.",

All in all it was supposed to be 6ish months that turned into a year. I was scared to reenter the market, especially one I was unfamiliar with.Turned my LinkedIn to open to work and got lots of interest. I’ve been interviewing a bunch over the last few months and hope to accept an offer soon. It’s hard to get back into the leetcode grind. Hard to build up behavioral answers when it’s been a year since you had the experience. It’s hard to have confidence interviewing when you don’t currently have a job. It’s hard.",

I was a bit worried when starting the search due to the doomer posts on this sub, but it honestly hasn’t been that bad. I admit I’m in a decent position due to a well-known but not FAANG company on my resume (as a previous role, not current role), name brand school, and yoe. I dropped to about 50 jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards, heard back from 8+ decent companies (like companies you might recognize, not just no name startups). Hit rate is much better for recruiters who reached out to me via LinkedIn or email. I honestly had to stop responding back after the first week of showing “open to job opportunities” on LinkedIn because of the overwhelming amount of messages for various startup roles, mostly AI. Went through the process for about 20 companies so far, rejected by 15, with the rest still ongoing but probably not able to finish before the offer deadline.Behavioral questions and hiring manager rounds I think are a cakewalk, just prepare your stories ahead of time. Hardest part is grinding leetcode questions to shake the rust off implementing DFS, binary search, etc. Feels like school again. System Design is okay. Can be challenging sometimes, but I feel like it’s easier to fall back on work experience with this and supplement with some studying. As opposed to coding questions which doesn’t have as much overlap with real work, and it feels like you just need to study solutions to a lot of different questions and practice.I don’t doubt that the market is grim out there for new grads or early in career folks, and certainly worse than a few years ago for senior folks. But at least from my limited pov, it’s still okay. When I get rejected, it’s still mostly because I fucked up a coding question. And there's definitely no shortage of AI startups trying to hire senior engineers.",

You don't need to think to repeat the question and that will help you come up with follow ups, and the answers to those follow ups can help your mental gears get started while showing the interviewer your thought process.

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.But a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive. That person's shooting way below their belt if they're just looking for a \"senior dev\" job that isn't extremely specialized and niche to actually *utilize* their background.If I had that experience, and I were trying to apply to \"regular\" jobs, I'd be fudging my resume to make myself look like the type of candidate that gets hired into those \"regular\" jobs. Know your audience.Their experience also confuses me, they make no mention of how much professional *SWE* experience they have. I know they were a PM for 15 years, but that's not relevant to SWE. Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE? It might be a bit telling they didn't bother to mention SWE experience at all, and focused on a bunch of qualifications and non-SWE roles in their rant. I'm just making assumptions here thoughI have 12 YOE, and I apply to Senior SWE roles and get them just fine. Even in the market of 2024, which is when I last job hopped. When I can do the job just fine... why would they try to hire someone with 38 YOE that's probably asking double or triple my salary?If I had 38 YOE, I don't think I'd be targetting the same roles I'm targetting today.

The difference between 2010s and 2025 in terms of way we do things is pretty significantly different. 2010s, cloud wasn't even really taking off, and even languages look drastically different today* 10 years experience AI/ML scientist at IBM Watson * Great experience for AI/ML jobs, not sure if that's what he's specifically looking for. Also depends on what he did specifically on the IBM Watson team, it might actually pigeon hole him into very specific/niche things where the only other companies doing that sorta thing would be places like OpenAI which have a lot of competition. Might not open doors in smaller companies if it's too niche.* Certification/Publications/Bachelors, OS, game engine, scripting language * Generally won't be relevant to anyone that has long term work experience like this guy, unless the publication is specifically for the role he's applying for.A large amount of his development experience also won't be relevant to today either, because he's been working for such a long time. 38 years ago is 1987. I doubt any employer really cares about his experience from '87 -> 2010 in this market, as it probably isn't that relevant.Like there's plenty of ways you can screw yourself even with a resume like this in today's market. Not saying this guy couldn't learn or like pick things up, but if you have people with the exact experience you're looking for in the exact tech stack within the last 5 years, you'd probably go for that guy right?Especially with a work history that long, he's gonna have to tailor his CV to every job he applies for to make it fit. I'd have cut all the project/program management stuff, the thought leader stuff etc and try and make relevant experience fit into a two pager, but depending on the order and timeline of his experience he might be screwed anyway. More is not always better.",

Pay is kinda garbage, knew a guy twice my age at the time bragging about making $115k, but he also barely did anything and was hunt and peck typing.There’s so many of these dudes I know who sit around bragging about working on military aircraft projects. I just don’t understand anyone not being retired by then. I didn’t get any good money until like 28 and I’m still looking at retiring by 40-45. Sure if you were in one of those embedded jobs being cushy maybe, but you’d have your nice that’s kind of insulated.

After that I had 5 rounds on the same day with 4 different people asking different questions and the last round was with the hiring manager and team about system design.

Meant to be harsh to show you why you likely haven't gotten interviews.1) tech lead should be capitalized, put Technical Lead2) \"I was responsible\", not necessary. The way I was taught was that one bullet should be one line.3) How does \"responsible for making technical decisions on behalf of my team\" help market you?4) Is this anonymized? \"Making the initial design and POC for a new project\" is useless information that tells me nothing about you. 5) Created a custom virtualization engine. Ok, we're getting somewhere. What is this?6) Why is Google uncapitalized?7) api is not a word. Capitalize to API.8) Move stack to bottom. Why is there Stack on the first two experiences, but Technologies used on the 3rd one?9) Your first experience tells me nothing about you. What's a project you worked on? What was your impact? Do you know what your impact was? How could you be unemployed since April and not put anything towards this? \"Worked on a custom virtualization engine that improved performance by X% (before/after). Designed and developed API responsible for XYZ that reduced costs by X%\"10) Python, Linux, Jenkins, all should be capitalized, they're proper nouns11) \"This includes writing code, managing other people's tasks, and the bureaucracy of getting multiple teams on the same page\". This doesn't tell me anything. Did you design anything? Sounds like you were a junior engineer changing CSS colors, talking over a scrum board, and sending out emails. Am I wrong? Tell me *why*.12) First sub-bullet point is better. The only positive I see here. Make this more concise. \"Parallelized test suites and reduced run time by 80% from 10 to 2.5 hours\"13) \"As part of suite optimization. I also made a custom partitioning service\". It's a casual resume, but the grammar needs to be better. Speak in active voice and not passive voice. \"Created a custom partitioning service to optimize tests...\" 14) Why do you give such useless info? \"This role included leadership responsibilities.\" That tells me nothing about what you did. \"Mentored and helped onboard new engineers by creating a X day plan, writing documents, pair programming\"15) \"And more\". Wtaf? 16) \"Jenkins (Also jenkins api)\" lol17) Software *e*ngineer. Capitalize.18) Why is feb lowercase?19) You wasted a whole line to tell me what the italics of \"Software engineer\" told me. Useless summary in this bullet here.20) \"for internal use, for department's team use\"... ok. What did it do? One time I sent a LMGTFY link to someone at work for C# documentation, I could write \"Worked on a custom script that linked to documentation for internal team use21) \"Currently slowly taking courses in mathematics\" is just bad. Just list your courses and say they're in progress.22) cpp/c? Do you think the shift or caps lock button exists to be used when you feel like it?23) You told me you used Python... 5 times over this resume.24) Skills: \"Decision making\" leads to this type of resume?25) \"Working with vague requirements\" but made the most vague resume possible",

A BS in computer science is preparing you to be able to understand on a deeper level the why and how of things, rather than just the practical application of a given framework. A BS in CS can prepare you to be a software developer, but it can also prepare you masters or PhD courses, to be a researcher, or any other number of things beyond being a front end web developer. There is a heavy expectation on software developers to be learning while off the clock, and this expectation starts early while you’re still in school.That said, your courses could also be bad, it’s hard to say from what you posted.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

Some changes are easy to make, like hanging pictures. Some changes aren’t necessarily hard they just take time. For example, in order to paint the walls you have to take everything off, cover floors and furniture, sand the walls, paint multiple coats, etc. And some things might seem easy on the surface but require a lot of behind the scenes work. For example, moving a stove from one wall to another. Because there is tons of complicated, specialized work hiding behind the walls. You have to move the gas lines, and you have to do it in a way that doesn’t interfere with or disrupt the electrical, plumbing, hvac, and god knows what else is behind the walls.”",

In fact, i would argue that there are so many people enrolled or graduated from OMSCS that even people who graduate from the in-person MSCS program at GA Tech are now mistaken for having it done online. Most hiring managers aren't stupid. We know it's online. If you were living in California or Texas at the same time you were getting your master's from GA Tech, we know it's online.However, like I said, the education itself is fine, so if you are just concerned about the quality of the education rather than the prestige, it's still a good program.

On the flip side, even companies that had layoffs continued to hire interns each summer at a similar rate.My observation wasn't that tech companies changed their interviewing practices, they just hired more. They'd interview as many people as they could and hire everyone who passed, rather than the usual case of some \"passing\" the interviews but still not getting selected over even stronger candidates.Overall tech companies are still growing and hiring.I'm seeing a trend to hire more in LCOL areas and countries - not outsourcing, but actually opening offices in other cities and countries.Another issue is that the number of CS grads has doubled in the last 10 years and is still rising. It's quite possible that the number of CS grads is going up faster than demand, so the issue isn't that hiring is down (in historic numbers), but rather that demand has grown faster than supply.",

But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.At the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.Now, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.Now, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.I do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).And I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing. I also do think there's a more global issue of real estate investing driving prices up and making it harder for people to buy homes for personal use.",

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there. So the cost of living in different countries compared to the US is not a static thing, and I think that there is good reason to believe that the cost of living abroad is going to catch up.",

I was working with some South American Devs, not saying it is perfect there but it is much more reasonable and the jury is out if America is really a better place.

I've only heard of this happening in special circumstances though. For whatever reason, all of FAANG and the trailing tech companies are gearing up to juice their employees for all they are worth and continue with massive layoffs to keep retained employees on their toes.

My responsibilities include having a healthy service, so yes, I will work past 5PM if there is an outage. That is the expectation of me in my field of work. I can work till 8PM, wake up for an outage (while on call) at 12AM, etc. no issues because that's what I signed up for when I accepted the offer at that company.I also ran into a different situation where my manager brought a vague task to me, I broke it down and gave some design considerations. I suggested a path because I thought it balanced the pros/cons of delivery time & scalability in the future. The manager pushed for something that would've been delivered faster, but would have resulted in cutting corners and been more painful to scale later. I said this is what I think, but if this is what you want I'm happy to do it with your signoff. Obviously a year later when it had to scale, it was a painful process of untying knots to make things work. In our 1:1 retro, I highlighted a (probably passive aggressive) \"had it been done this way, it could've gone better\" and the manager asked why I didn't push harder for my design. At the end of the day, you're my boss - I don't care enough about this company to want to push things my way. I'll suggest, if you say otherwise - we'll do it your way no problem.Getting reprimanded about how they think I should care more etc. was eye-rolling. The best managers I've had were ones who understood that I have a life outside of work and trust that my suggestions are based on my experience & education. I'm willing to hear \"hey I think this way can work, are there any reasons why you don't want to consider that\"? And I can have a discussion on it no problem. Once I hear \"we need to do it this way\", I lose interest.",

Look at answers when testing, because you ain't so smart to figure it out on your own2. Timebox pain, because after 30 minutes another hour probably won't lead to you finding a solution3. Ask for help, better to look stupid and learn faster4. Don't copy and paste code, build up the muscle memory and force yourself to really know what code you're stealing is5. Learn how to TDD6. Make a hobby app7. Break big problems in to a lot of small problems8. Working code that sucks is better then sucky code that doesn't work. Also make it easy to refactor and make your code stop sucking.9. Jump ship every 2 years.10. Over communicate",

The fact that you're doing full-stack work right out the gate is hugee. Most new grads get pigeonholed into one tiny piece of the system. You're getting exposure to legacy systems, modern React, cloud migrations, testing... that's honestly a pretty well rounded foundation.At Metana we see a lot of people get caught up thinking they need to learn every new framework. But honestly, the fundamentals you're building, understanding systems, debugging, working with teams, matter way more than knowing the latest JavaScript framework.For leveling up income, give it 12-18 months then start looking around. Having real experience under your belt changes everything in negotiations. The fact that you've worked in sales is actually a huge advantage most developers don't have.Your current setup sounds like a great place to build solid foundations without the pressure cooker environment of some tech companies. Make the most of it!",

Then you get a developer or team to slowly guide you through the app/code, and get pointed to a bunch of docs to get you ramped up.You'll then get a simple guide on how to setup your dev environment with about 10 steps. 3 days later after debugging the fact that half those steps failed and nothing worked like the doc said you'll finally have a dev environment.Then you usually get a toy task or two, fixing a small big or something super easy - just to get you acquainted and you get ramped up from there.

Meeting with people, asking questions, finding out who your stakeholders are (business and management), who their stakeholders are. What are their goals? What are their pressing needs? You’re building to enable them, largely, but as an engineer, you can see needs and designs they can’t always see. So being witness to their conversations or structures can be eye opening. Having 1:1s and asking questions about the application/applications you’re working on will help. Who do you ask to learn more about specific parts of the app? What dependencies does your app have and who’s responsible for those? How do larger changes happen in the org? Are there special-interest groups/committees regarding your domains? How do you join them?",

You can quit for *no* reason.Most people give a generic \"oh I was looking for a change\" reason to not stir things too much.You could go with \"to focus on my studies\".If people start hassling you and guilt tripping you for your own life decisions, they're not good people.If you can, ditch at least one of the part-time jobs. Maybe take up more hours at the least-worst one if you need the pay.That should at least mean you only have to deal with a single company's way of working.Burnout can be pretty serious. Going straight into a new job without recovering is unlikely to go smoothly in all honesty.If you can, I'd say focus on finishing your studies + recovering.If you really like the incoming offers, ask them if you can join x months in the future once you're finished with current studies.Also remember: it's not your company. Turn up, do your job well, then go home. If that's not good enough to stop things imploding, that's someone further up the chain's problem.

If you want to start working almost immediately, consider staffing firms, as they can usually get you in somewhere the same week. It might not be the best job or the best pay for the first 90 or so days before you go permanent, but I've found that's a short amount of time in grand scheme of things. If you have no interest in that, though, then yeah, just keep applying and preparing for interviews.",

Or did you assume it'd be OK to wait until 8am?Obviously an expectation of after-hours responses isn't healthy, it creates a bad WLB. Your time outside of working hours belong to you. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.Another side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?Especially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.Even on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day. I don't guarantee to be reachablea fter 5pm, but f I get a Slack/Teams message after 5 I normally just pop in a quick response: \"What's the urgency on this? I'm not at my laptop (even if I am), can this wait till the morning?\"Communication makes the dream work. which actually kinda ties into a secondary issue... are you even sure this whole after hours debacle had anything to do with your managers review? Were you having 1/1's with your manager talking about what was going well and what wasn't? Your manager not renewing your contract should not have been a surprise. Sure that's also a failure of *them* for not communicating, but communciation goes both ways.",

It's a choice.As an intern, your goal is to learn (which you're doing) and get a foot in the door.As an employer, they're looking for talent that might come back. If the relationship doesn't work for one party, then it doesn't proceed. Simple as that. But before you join the \"fuck that toxic company\" chorus, keep a couple things in mind. The firm doesn't care about you -- that is totally true. But it might be different for individuals. This is a natural opportunity to network with them. People move, so stay in touch, make a good impression, and show them what you can do. People respond to positive people, so try to keep that going.Now to the caveat. In my experience (in the US), interns are usually non-exempt. So I don't expect them to go past their paid hours. If you have a boss that doesn't understand that, that's not good. But ultimately, it's your choice. Anyway, it's all decided now, so just try to stay positive with colleagues in your time left.",

If that's how you feel about them, then you need to give them that feedback during the internship so they can address it.>Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?There are two answers here: the practical one and the ideological one.The practical one: \"Hey big boss, is this something urgent you need done right now - and if so, by when? If not, is it ok if I get back to you tomorrow at 8am?\". You just *have* to ask. I've been doing this for 12 years and got a new VP 2 years ago and the first time he asked me to do something at 5pm on a weekday I immediately assume he meant that instant (because I've had bosses like that in the past), but I asked \"hey, do you need this right now?\" and he immediately went \"oh god no, no - do not work on this right now. This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow\".But i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment. And then you have to decide whether you want the job (which means you should do it), or whether you think this is BS and don't care to work for a company like that (in which case you don't).And that's the ideological answer: if you don't want to work for a company that expects you to be on call without being officially on call (i.e., getting paid more for it), then you shouldn't just go along with that stuff.",

I think it really depends since in terms of Chinese research, specifically in AI/ML, still isn't that impressive, yet. So I think a lot of US companies would discount that (not completely ignore) because it's a foreign university especially if your goal is in something like a regular dev role.But I think outside of top US companies (like MSFT Research) the Chinese Tsinghua University is actually pretty well respected especially within Asian countries/communities. I think even within these top private research institutions it's also still pretty well respected.",

There was a shortage of software skills for a long while. And arguably there is still one for senior roles, hence H1Bs. But when it comes down to **entry-level** positions, there is no question that companies will still prefer Americans. The cost and the risk of the visa lottery isn't worth it on the low skill level. There might be more openness to it for master program graduates with specific skill sets. But entry level + BS + need for a visa in 2025 is a pretty difficult combination. You see tons of resumes in this sub from people specifically looking for sponsorship.That said, H1Bs are not the reason that the CS market has stagnated at the lower level. I think it's easy to blame a single group or entity when things are not going well, but there are more powerful factors affecting the market including:* Offshoring* Everyone who prints \"Hello World!\" Is a \"Senior Software Engineer\".* Companies that pushed the boundaries of CS are now monopolies impending progress.

Modern self-driving cars were introduced about a decade ago. At the time, there was a lot of hype. There were predictions that we’d have fully autonomous vehicles within a few years. Millions of truck drivers, delivery drivers, and taxi drivers would suddenly be out of work. Progress has been made, like Waymo’s driverless taxis, has been made. But, it has much slower and the edge cases have much harder to solve than anticipated. I think we might see AI play out similarly where progress is slower and the edge cases, which are kind of infinite when talking about general use AI, are harder to overcome than the hype masters hope. Or maybe someone will release AGI tomorrow. :person_shrugging:",

I personally don’t think there’s anything wrong with reaching out to your recruiter or hiring manager and confirming they don’t need anything else from your end at this point. Changing jobs is always an anxiety generating event for me. I used to lose sleep that something random would come up in my background check and my offer would be rescinded (hasn’t happened yet…knock on wood). I don’t see anything usual in your post. In the very unlikely worst case scenario where your offer is pulled for restructuring or budget cuts, I think FAANG companies still provide a few months pay. And you cracked FAANG once, so you can probably do it again if you had to. I would try to relax as much as possible if I was in your shoes. Easier said than done, but hopefully you can find something fun to take your mind off things for a while. Good luck with your new job. I hope everything works out for you.",

To get my first job out of a boot camp I took a gig stocking shelves in a warehouse at a tech company, networked my ass off for a year internally, and got hired into the next junior role they had.2. Build useful things. Not a movie rating app, build something that you could charge money for. In fact, if you can actually monetize it, that's the best case scenario. Ideally, you'd build something that confronts some of the more challenging problems in web design. An app that solves caching problems with real time interactivity across users is cool and shows something, but your movie rating app won't count for hardly anything.3. Don't go remote. Anyone in the world can compete for a remote job, so it's orders of magnitude harder to stand out. Apply for in-office jobs with local companies who can meet you face to face. It filters out the competition and let's you make the process a little less sterile.Honestly, if you're 100% self taught, you need a bangin project. Even with boot camp programs you get some kind of \"OK, they know *something*\" assurance. If you're self-taught using online resources (which is what I would consider Udemy) you're going to need to be able to show some good work.The good news is that if you *can* show good work, I think a self-taught dev that can build is always going to be viewed more favorably than a boot camp dev who can build, just because self-taught takes some grit.",

The nicest thing about startups is the flexibility around role mobility and titles, go for it. Plus, worst case outcome here is a polite no, you’ve enough context/leverage from being there so long that I can’t imagine a scenario where they don’t consider you seriously or are upset that you shot your shot. If they say yes, negotiate a generous base salary/equity bump too, you’ll take on a lot more responsibility/stress and should be compensated for it accordingly.",

I think dev configurations are a great place to start honestly, you get a ton of instant, quick feedback, LSPs are a gateway drug into incremental compilers, and in general how a lot of open source architecture is implemented is based on unix philosophy (do one thing and do it well), and this naturally lends itself to a lot of \"distributed systems\" problems (maybe not a global fleet of millions of processes, but certainly quite a lot; what do you think those processes are doing when you type \"ps aux\"?). also if you have a CS degree you'll pick up this shit really quickly lol",

Idk if its as relevant for cybersecurity though, that field has some more well established certifications like CISSP that would probably be more recognized then a masters in something generic like CS.

The same applies to ML; however, having a degree in this area will be more beneficial practically than a philosophy degree.Personally, I would also like to pursue a master's degree in philosophy, but I see it as something I will do when I retire or if I choose to follow a management or leadership path.All be best.

They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. I took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. Chatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert. You didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful \"self-studying\" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. So just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",

I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I’m at currently which I agree is not very good. I do believe in my capability of growing to write more academically as I have a strong argument against simulation theory that I have talked to both cs professors and philosophers professors about and got good feedback. I bought all the relevant existing literature(Dennet, Bolstram, Chalmers) so I can reference and engage with literature.

        "body": "With 10 years of experience and a master's degree, you're absolutely qualified, but many companies use certifications as a lazy screening mechanism because it's easier than properly evaluating real-world experience. The fact that interviewers kept pushing about certifications despite your detailed technical explanations shows they're following a checklist rather than assessing your actual capabilities.Getting multiple certifications in a short timeframe isn't a red flag when you already have the underlying experience - it just shows you're adapting to market demands. The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.I'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",

But if you're starting to come apart insofar as being able to complete the tasks you want to do, then pushing yourself harder won't necessarily be a great outcome. In fact, it can make things worse. Personally I cycle through burnout about once every 1-2 years. It started when I was 20. Before that time, I was un-phased by heavy work loads. I graduated salutatorian from high school, worked a full time job, studied engineering, nothing could stop me - then one day I was in the hospital having a complete meltdown. 23 years later I never really went back to the old me; I don't know if it was because I ignored the signs, or if it was because I was always going to be like this eventually.At any rate, my advice - don't ignore it. Talk to someone, take some time off, do whatever it takes to not fall apart. Unless you're my age, you'll have time to figure it out.",

Only thing is, he wasn't enrolled in any current CS program so def case by case. Idk if this helps but here are a few things to note:\\- Some internships require you to go back to school for at least 1 semester before coming back (for either another internship, or full-time)\\- You can either get a return offer for another internship, or for a full-time role. For some companies, this might depend on your graduation date. (Ex: they see you don't graduate for more than a year so you're considered for internship instead)So, even if you're not close to graduation maybe you can come back as an intern (a few companies might even let you extend your internship or work contract/part-time while you finish school) until you're eligible for the full-time return!",
