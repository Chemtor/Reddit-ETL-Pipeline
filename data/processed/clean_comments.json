Pretty much all of the high ups that I know—C-suite, people making 300k+ in high value consulting, managing directors at global firms—have gotten their jobs in a incestuous web of companies, and usually from someone they worked with in the past. Engineering manager jobs or 250k+ jobs—jobs with limited availability and high demand—don’t usually go to unknowns. I’m not saying it’s impossible, I’m just saying that your career path is what has put you in your current position. You are not trying to make an obvious next step, but break through in a qualitative way.I don’t think there are really…immediate concrete steps as simple as “write a better cover letter.”",

It isn’t about what they “do” differently, it’s simply a consequence of the portfolio they’re hired for.Large tech companies run portfolios covering at least a single digit percent of global compute in that space. For example, if you’re a data engineering manager at Meta on the social media side, you’re probably responsible for a single digit global percent of your area (ads, content review, infra, analytics) etc.As such, you can compute the “budget” each company assigns to the average employee on the back of declared margins. **This is where, even if you think you’re changing the world with your work in a company / sector that isn’t profitable. . . You’re probably correct in your assessment that you’re doing better work than your counterpart in a FAANG job, but in the end, it doesn’t matter.**To answer your question about what to do, it’s the same things you would think if you were running that portfolio and hiring: Build domain familiarity with real, practical, demonstrable experience in the technology stack that particular organization you’re looking to get into works on. . Network heavily with people adjacent to that team on LinkedIn or through real introductions from a senior person in the company (this works more often than you think) and try to get on the radar of the recruiters in a non desperate way(The variance here is massive)In the end, once you’re “in” . . It’s a small world and everyone kinda knows each other and end up cycling through the same companies if they’re decent enough at what they do.

Data scientists usually need to spend more time conceptualizing the model and figure out what the problem is, what the model should do, how to engineer the data to accurately represent the business scenario, what are the biases in it, what are the limitations of the model, etc. These challenges take enough of their time and mental capacity that considering anything more will actually lead to compromising the model quality. They also tend(based on my own bias) to be non-coders, like statisticians, phds, analytics etc., and the technical aspects like package compatibility, resource limitations, pipeline and deployment don't really come to their mind. It's not that they are not bothered, it's just that they are not aware of the challenges engineers deploying the project face.I understand the challenges engineers face and it can be so frustrating. Awareness and communication between the two teams is important. Make them aware of the issues you face. Help them understand the importance of following coding standards. There are so many tools nowadays which can help with all these challenges, if the data scientists are aware of it, they will definitely use it to make your experience better and make the overall process faster and smoother.",

One idea I have here is to tag blogs separately - Company Blog, Engineering Blog, Personal Blog, News/Magazine/Podcast, etc. The more metadata we have, the easier it is for us to judge and not engage with what might possibly be a \"self promotion\".",

The China team was very effective despite the time difference, the India team was not (and frankly, the competency gap was embarrassingly stark).This resulted in a \"snap-back\" in jobs that there offshored back to locations in NA (the US specifically). Essentially, almost all offshored employees were laid off, and all contracts canceled.The business argument that was made was basically: \"It costs almost as much to employ Chinese DEs as in the US, with comparable competency levels, but a timezone gap issue. Meanwhile, we can employ 2-3 Indian employees/contractors for the cost of one competent US employee, but not only is there a timezone gap, there are seemingly a ton of communication issues, like sudden unannounced PTO/Holidays taken during product launches for example, and even when you can reach them, you're lucky if even 1 of these employees can write basic SQL code.\"The result was a much more robust vetting of US based employees, including several rounds of technical interviews, and thorough background checks...Edit to add context: The hiring practices when offshoring to India were pathetically lackadaisical.Basically, the process was: Recruiter: \"Do you know SQL?\" Candidate: \"Yes\" Recruiter: \"Are you willing to work for peanuts? (~30-40% of US-based DE)\" Candidate: \"Yes\" Recruiter: \"You're hired!\" Candidate: \"Yes\" Recruiter: \"Great! Though um, that wasn't a yes or no question.\" Candidate: \"Yes\"And let's be real, it doesn't matter where you're hiring from, if that's your process, expect this result.Meanwhile, the NA and EU candidates I've observed have been going through the wringer, with multiple (as many as 5-6) rounds of technical interviews that span 3-4 MONTHS!

This is called bronze in a medallion architecture - A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the \"single source of truth\" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools. This is what most users will ever see. In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.The 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.Besides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size. Again, some will disagree.",

While vendor-created terms and patterns are not inherently bad (the data lakehouse pattern is super useful), their purpose is to provide an \"onramp\" into understanding new ideas you want the market to adopt.

In particular, data contracts require preventive enforcement, and if you are profiling data, it means incorrect data has already been written to database systems and is propagating across the business. If anything, I argue that data profiling is more closely tied to data observability, which complements data contracts but serves a different purpose.I argue that data contracts need enforcement where data is either first generated, captured, or ingested. In the Glassdoor case study above, they use static code analysis to extract metadata from the code to determine what function calls in the application relate to a data asset. Then apply LLMs to this highlighted code to determine the codified business logic irrespective of the data. Enforcement of expectations on the code ensures prevention via CI/CD before the code is deployed and thus before data is written.My recent article [*Your Data Contracts Are in the Wrong Spot*](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/your-data-contracts-are-in-the-wrong) goes into more detail on this.",

Our latest Sail 0.4 release introduces native Apache Iceberg support and provides major architectural improvements to Delta Lake execution. The release also lays the foundation for distributed DML operations across open data formats and marks a key step toward Sail’s goal of a fully unified lakehouse engine.# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source, Rust-native, multimodal computation framework which includes drop-in replacement compatibility for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built from the ground up in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by up to 94%. Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.# What’s New in Sail 0.4* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.# Join the Slack CommunityWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)! Whether you’re exploring Sail for the first time, migrating workloads, or contributing code, here you can collaborate, ask questions, and help shape the future of data infra.Check out the full release post here → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/)Would love to hear your thoughts!",

Both your Iceberg and Delta docs state that 'it is not recommended to use Sail to overwrite or modify existing [tables] created by other engines.' Does this mean the migration process for existing tables is reading the existing table, writing a new one, and removing the original? What about in reverse - can I write a table with Sail and update it from Spark?2. What's your funding model? Hosted platform / services at some point?",

The people who do understand how it works have a hard time explaining it to them and they might not have the patience and humility to listen. Which brings me to my next point. In my experience, doing DE doesn't necessarily mean I don't have to deal with people, presentations, and politics. I deal with that stuff a lot. Maybe not every DE does, but I find myself constantly put in positions where I have to coordinate with cross-functional groups of people or make presentations about how stuff works or what problems we discovered. That said, I hated the kinds of \"people\" work I had to do before, but don't hate it as much as a DE. Part of it is because I have supportive leaders who want me to do this stuff, and the other part of it is that you usually know what you're going to get out of a DE project so it's easier to propose and explain.",

        "body": "I switched to Data Engineering 10 years ago. I have a statistics background and was doing data science back then. I was kinda frustrated TBH, everything we learned back in university, all those stochastic and probability based models were way too complex to be deployed in any business back then and I had a very hard time explaining, convincing people why it's useful and whatnot. At the same time I really liked the engineering part of things as the focus of my study was always on the computational side of things. At some point back then I remember getting super interested in Spark and did a small project with it. It turns out that there is another team using it already and then I joined that team as a junior data engineer. That was kinda my transition story to DE but the funny thing is that sometimes, in my free time, I read about those things that I used to do as a hobby :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:",

This was not the case at tech companies, but by the time I worked there, I was software engineering anyway (data engineering -> ML Ops deployments -> software engineering), so the line was blurred. Also I studied software engineering.For your case, I recommend focusing on the 'Python' part of those skills, and doing the areas that you enjoy like pipelines and process automation. Companies have inefficient processes and need people that can understand the underlying data and the business, as much as the tech. If you can keep doing great work in those areas, without losing sight of the business context, you will do great, and lots of opportunities will continue to open up for you!",

        "body": "I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements6. Depends on your definition of \"seamless\" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously. I can't imagine a scenario where Snowflake wouldn't be able to scale to your needsSnowflake documentation is pretty good, and readable, so is always a useful place to start if you want to get a better understanding of the platform in general or specific capabilities : [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started)",

It's an enterprise platform which means it pretty much has all the capabilities you're hoping for, but you'll also need to have some patterns and guidelines to keep the analysts from just building all kinds of stuff without effective centralization, certified datasets, gold layers, etc. It can handle all that, but it comes down to a people and process thing that you need to get right.The Power BI benefits are pretty big and I think will be desirable to you. There's direct and native Power BI integration either through direct lake storage modes for semantic models, or through just importing into a normal import mode models. But also Power Query (Dataflows Gen2) are a great tool for the low code analysts that already know those tools. You can use dataflows pretty much anywhere on the platform. Since it sounds like you have a data savvy team and you're looking to increase your maturity and capabilities, I think investing in some fabric training and help with codifying some design patterns would be really beneficial (if you go with Fabric) to get your team started on the right foot.",

Practically speaking, it means Snowflake, Mozart, and other companies that want to use dbt Fusion engine as part of an offering will have to get different licensing from dbt Labs.dbt Labs has continued to pour most of their resources into dbt Platform (rebrand of dbt Cloud), and I don't see that changing.

Yes, it's probably the same devs doing the work, but if Fusion is the future and you make zero money on core, from a business perspective what do you think they leave behind?I don't care what's in the news and what they say will happen going forward. The merge happened for business and money reasons. When that happens, lowering expenses and increasing sales becomes the game. Their investors are looking for profits and speed. Developing 2 of the same product doesn't fit that mold.With that said, it's in their best interest to continue the dev on both until there is feature parity and Fusion is ready for prime time.

Once all the records are united by a single ID, you can then reconcile the data points according to whatever logic you like.In your case, you could also maybe add a column for like, 'ID\\_Type' and give it values like 'guid', 'email', 'phone' etc., where you have CRMs using those things as their unique identifiers. The nice thing about this set up is you aren't limited to one ID per system.The output of such a table would look something like this: +-------------------+-----+------------+ | Internal/Master ID| ID | ID_System | +-------------------+-----+------------+ | 1 | 123 | SAP | | 1 | 456 | SalesForce | | 1 | 789 | SalesForce | | 1 | 101 | SalesForce | | 2 | 987 | SAP | | 2 | 654 | SalesForce | | 2 | 321 | SalesForce | | 2 | 852 | SalesForce | +-------------------+-----+------------+",

If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)). Might be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.Also if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.I haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt. Just FYI you can use dbt Core with Airflow, a great way there is Cosmos. Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer, we made Cosmos (which is OSS, so you can run it no matter how you run Airflow), adopted and maintain the DAG Factory and do managed Airflow, so I am biased towards Airflow. Though in this case I guess I just gave an assist to cloud composer which is our competitor. If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",

If you want to democratize your transformations a bit to those that are familiar with SQL, then the learning curve on dbt will be fairly low. You get the bonus of having quality control by having your SQL (dbt models) version controlled and peer reviewed via pull requests. Also control over deployments. Your dbt code should be in a repository with a CI process that tests it and then publishes an image to Google Artifacts Registry. Cloud Run will pick up the image when Composer runs it, just use the Cloud Run Operator.Sure newer orchestration tools like Dagster and Prefect a bit sexier. Airflow is proven, its flaws are well known and it will do you (and many many others) just fine. Cloud Composer simplifies the management of it quite a bit and that is the route I'd go.

Dev flow is great.Our user facing serving APIs are not on prem tho. It's just a big Rust stateless modulith with Tonic gRPC, Axum for REST and the data queries/vector queries are using LanceDB/Datafusion + object storage + Redis. Docker Swarm and Docker stack for deployment.

Your analyst team is aware of what they want to data (in terms of cleaning and transformations), what is the output as well as SQL. They will definitely find this tool very handy.

Be faithful to source in stg (or base), then expose the entity or concept in marts to end users. In between you can add ”an” intermediate layer. And this is all semantics - we, for example, add an intermediate layer called ”enriched” which has the sole purpose of union all separate staged sources into one table. It is then clear for developers in our team that when building marts we reference enriched models. As others has said, intermediate models can reference other intermediate models (for us, intermediate feeds into enriched occasionally).We also use an intermediate layer called ”intermediate” for, typically, ephemeral transformations that are reused but not necessarily materialized.",

You can use multi asset decorator to deal with this quite well.AssetSelection for jobs can get annoying if you have a mix of dbt source + ref tables in them. There should be an ability to override skipped materializations so that they don’t cascade down the dag override downstream materializations. If I have 3 ingestion branches that are referenced in a downstream table, if one of those branches doesn’t have new or updated data, then I don’t want to churn the tables. I wish I could in that case mark specific assets with a “Skipped but successful” status so that if there was new data in the one of the other branches the final table rematerialized to include the new data. I know in this scenario the 3 ingestion branches could be separate jobs but that feels messy.",

Maybe these automation conditions can help your downstream issues as well??Yes, AssetSelection really needs a good DBT structure with tags or otherwise something you can query easily from Dagster.",

I can't find a way for that except just making a long list of notes on when they took a leave, and then adding back the number of sessions they took a leave. It is a mess. After all that mess, my manager still wanted me to also keep track of transactions in the monolithic spreadsheet. Well, that's the bell for me, I need to make this right. Haha.And then I also need to synchronize this excel sheet to an external spreadsheet for my sales team, and my company is a bit warry of google, so they don't want me to completely upload everything on there, I then need to manually select them, copy them, and make sure I don't copy the wrong stuff, and it's hard to synchronize the data if sales team managed to change some of it.

With this you can simply connect your end DB directly to the iceberg catalog as the front and get a good performance as the majority of them have native iceberg connectors.

My recommendations would be to pick a spark based platform like Fabric (my 2nd Preference) or Databricks (my 1st Preference) learn about multi-language spark support - e.g. use spark sql and PysparkSQL. Learn about UDFs, parquets, partitioning, merges and SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) and merge statements. API ingestion patterns and different ways you can authenticate, paginate and any frameworks. If you ho with databricks, pick Delta Live Tables, Databricks asset bundles, streaming tables etc and almost certainly CI CD. DbT would be another thing to think off. Sorry for sounding overwhelming but this is what I have used day in and out over past 5 years in several DE roles and find these transferrable in my opinion. Hope this helps",

However, if that initial part is done properly, most of the work later on becomes analytical engineering (aka, translating business needs into sql queries).Learn Polars instead of Pandas. But in fact, if you want to seriously learn DE, focus more on SQL / relational databases (for the base) + distributed computing / operational vs analytical databases.Get the books \"Designing Data Intensive Applications\" (amazing, cant recommend enough. It will give you a great understanding on why certain tools exist and why they are relevant) and \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" (from Joe Reis. Quite basic book, but great if you are starting)",

        "body": "I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under \"control\" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever. Also, there are routine things, but most of the time we are thinking in new ideas, so we are free to be creative.If you have any questions I am glad to answer them!",

DevContainer would probably get lumped in here as well. It's how I start most of my new projects these days.Ci/cd, IaC, branching strategies, feature flags, tdd, etc are also critical skill sets for any engineer.Terraform is a good investment if you work in the cloud.The rest of it is moving, shaping, analyzing, and orchestrating data which is all table stakes for a DE. It sounds like you have the important bits down, but do consider spark to gain an understanding of parallelized data processing. It isn't often needed, but conceptually it's important, and with databricks floating around in a lot of large organizations, it's a good skill set to have.",

There will be reports, there will be dashboards, there will be analytics there will be god knows what.Whatever will be the next hype cycle in the world data, companies still need their infrastructure running. As the old joke goes, whenever a data scientist joins a company, the first question they ask is 'well do you have a data infrastructure running?' and the answer is mostly no.AI/ML is really interesting and there is space for innovation. DE work is less innovation, but more hands on problem solving. I liked working in both. You can still transit from DE to AI/ML easily, you'd have a very solid foundation.I'd vouch for DE with an AI/ML flavour. If the market shifts, then you can become DE with a something else flavour (e.g. bit of analytics on side. Dashboarding maybe?). You already have an ongoing experience with AI/ML, combine that with a solid expertise in DE and you have good chances ahead I think. I'm sure i'd be happy to have someone like that on my team.Some skillset i'd recommend overal: strong grip on SQL and Python is already given for you which is great. Add understanding PySpark on top (with Spark generally), add a good understanding of a cloud provider (Azure or AWS, some relevant resources) add a data platform skill on top (Databricks or Snowflake). Get a basic understanding of OOP, maybe implement a simple pipeline platform in OOP for an example project.The market will always change and shift and we always had to adapt. Learning never stops in either field, but i agree that AI/ML is currently steeper than DE. If you cant land a DE role, go for a Data Analyst with (and i cant emphasise this enough) heavy tech skills orientation. Many business views DA jobs business only and not IT. I started off with a DA job and I was an SQL monkey for a year. I actually quite liked it, then i transitioned into DE with a very strong SQL base knowledge.i hope i could be useful.",

Partner with a university, library, or NumFOCUS for venue/fiscal sponsorship to keep costs down; publish the budget, offer low-cost tickets and travel scholarships. Build a committee with folks from DE, analytics, SRE, and ML to review across stacks. Use Discord/Slack for comms and Sessionize or Sched for scheduling.For demos, think Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms, and DreamFactory for auto-generating secure REST APIs from databases when you need to expose curated tables.For OP in the US, near-term vendor-light options: Data Council (Austin/SF), QCon data tracks, PyData, and ODSC East/West if you pick the DE sessions.Start local with clear rules and you’ll have a real vendor-neutral data conference fast.",

I cannot answer precisely on business wins as I had less exposure to end business users.From my experience, I can tell that it works well when there is a consuming/business team driving MDM with proper requirements and goals. Slowly it can evolve and become an enterprise level golden data layer by onboarding other business groups. This becomes a single source for multiple departments and business teams within an organization, this in itself solved a lot of things and improves productivity and business insights.Examples I have seen,- better(faster) customer onboarding and handling with the Customer master.- Improved vendor insights using supplier mastering.- I have not done product master implementation but I have seen a lot of top companies doing that as well.Cons:- MDM projects might fail if an organization fails to involve a business rep (MDM requires a lot of business involvement to deliver)- MDM projects unnecessarily extend and fail to deliver if an organization has short term vision- Vendor lock might be a problem as MDM is offered as a Software product- Sometimes it can be too complex- Before bringing mdm it is important to educate clients on what value MDM can provide and what are the limitations of MDM. It might sound absurd but I have seen a couple of projects cancelled midway due to this.Please let me know if my answer is naive. I am improving as a MDM Engineer and the feedback will help me.",

And without somewhere to reconcile them all to one customer record, every downstream instance suffers So the MDM team creates master data tables that are referenced in ETL flows created by the date engineering So the data engineering team extracts data from a source, reconciles it against master data, and drops it in the enterprise data warehouse It's not perfect. The teams are all spread thin and the company is still not there with process maturity overall But, being able to have one team just focus on defining what the \"truth\" is with the business is awesome",

Then you can use a couple different techniques. You can use something like minhash lsh if you have lots names you need to dedupe. Whether or not you use that, you’ll need to match names in a way that discounts common words and prioritizes uncommon words. Most distance metrics don’t work well for this because you’ll get really high values for names that aren’t actually that close. For example, using Levenshtein distance “apple corporation” and “Snapple corporation” (different companies) are very close, but “Bernstein Partnership, LTD” and “Bernstein” (same company) are not. You can look at various text vectorization models on huggingface that should be able to account for the fact that “corporation” is basically meaningless while “Snapple” is significant. If you have enough data you may even be able to just use tf-idf.If you want you can then lay on hierarchical clustering or just use a score cutoff.Last, you’ll probably want this wrapped up with some kind of feedback mechanism so you can make a lookup table to unify known alternatives over time. Once you know that A and B are actually C, you can store it in a table so you don’t have to run this expensive analysis on those names again",

        "body": "I've done something similar at a previous job at scale in the health tech space. I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg \"Used X medical device to do Y procedure.\"). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.Where to start:1. You have to understand the business logic and what a \"meaningful\" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). 4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say \"as much as possible\" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.You now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders. Bonus, if it's a huge success, you now also have direct metrics for employee reviews/resume.Please note that this was back in 2020. So there may be better methods than this, but here's an example of something that was deemed successful at the company.",

I was using BQ before my current role with Redshift. My company also has 1 department that uses Snowflake, which accounts for maybe 2% of our data warehouse usage. That 2 percent costs us the same in 1 week on Snowflake as the other 98% costs us in a month with Redshift. Overall, Redshift does what you need it to do, and it's pretty freaking cheap compared to the alternatives. It's not the best database out there, but for the price, I honestly can't complain.",

The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes. Unless the workload as a whole requires more simultaneous executions instead of individual query performance.",

Also consider an initial engagement with 1 vendor where they are not able to bid on the down stream work (or at least that is what you tell them). The look others for the actual work.

In Go, upsert into a raw schema with a unique constraint on a surrogate key like sha1(coalesce(key1,'') || '|' || coalesce(key2,'')); that kills dupes at the door and makes retries safe. For historicals, don’t chase “active only” upstream land everything and model “active” as an attribute. In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\\_key = that surrogate and check\\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\\_from/valid\\_to/is\\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. For incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes. Dimensions shouldn’t truncate soft-delete with an is\\_active flag and keep facts referentially stable.Dev workflow: dbt Core CLI + VS Code (SQLTools + dbt Power User), local DuckDB for rapid iteration, then target Postgres; add SQLFluff to keep SQL sane.

Then use `is_active` as a flag in the dimension to mark current vs historical rows. But I need clarification: should `is_active` live in the dimension table itself, or should I create a separate `fact_active_jobs` table and build off that?**On CDC and row versions:**Right now I'm pulling from an Oracle view that filters the ERP's fact table down to active jobs only—but that fact table has no `rowversion`. Should I (A) remove the filters at the view level and hash the full fact table as-is, or (B) go down to the base tables, use their `rowversion`, and rebuild the fact tables from scratch in dbt?Also, on the `is_active` dimension question: should that column live in the dimension table itself, or do I need a separate structure?**On soft-deleting dimensions:** I thought dimensions were supposed to maintain unbroken history by their nature. Wouldn't adding `is_active` and deleting rows break the sequence? And isn't it the fact table's job to differentiate active vs inactive in reports?**On dbt and orchestration:**1. I have IntelliJ—should I stick with that or move to VS Code + SQLTools like you suggested?2. Should I consider sqlmesh instead of dbt?3. Right now Go orchestrates everything sequentially (sync → dims → facts). Should I keep Go calling dbt, or move to pub/sub for reactive processing? or should i try to make postgres and dbt handle all the scheduling and keep go for syncing.4. Should the T in ETL be dbt, or should I use Python/Kotlin?**On keys in a star schema:** I'm confused about surrogate vs natural vs business keys. Should I use one or both in dimensions and facts? Should my primary keys be the business key, or the surrogate key?Thanks for taking the time; never went to college and learned this through videos, so I appreciate the clarity.",

I’d just keep an eye on duplication drift as you scale how often new batches repeat existing data over time. That metric has saved me a few headaches.",

So you want to choose approaches that work for the data as it is today AND will continue to work as the data changes in the future, without you ever examining the data again later.You should have a test somewhere that all the data conforms to a general pattern of \"number + text\", then extract the number part and convert it to a database numeric type (integer or decimal, as required). Separately extract the text part, to another next column. You will then need to hard code the SI prefixes to factors: K means x1000, m means x0.001, M means x1000000, and so on. But these are a universal system worldwide, and there are only so many possible values. You should capture these in a data table that you reference or join to, rather than in code.Then do arithmetic using the numeric part as you were thinking.Hard coding would break if the data changes later once this process is in production and you've moved into a different project. Just looking at the top 10 values is based on how the data is now: a different unit might be in the top 10 next month or next year. So again, it's a fragile approach. One of the best principles I've been given by a former boss: always design yourself out of the processes you build.",

I recall in the dsx format that you had to change data at different places. In the end this method is usually ok for operations like changing names, some properties etc... but I think adding a stage might be difficult or need quite some work reverse engineering of the xml export format. But does the part you want to add is connected to the rest of the job ? If not why not add new jobs ? If you are using Px sometimes using RCP and generic jobs can be time efficient.",

You don't need an API integration for SSMS, you need one for the database itself (just like SSMS provides a human friendly integration with the database). Secondly, why are you using a long outdated version of SSMS? SSMS is free.Do you mean the database server itself is SQL Server 2014? If so, that's getting close to being out of Extended Security Updates availability too (mid 2027), but upgrading isn't free and takes effort, so it may be outside your control.",

And I like that you started with data frames and parquet.\\- As a dev, I can get into this easily and understand it right away. The path to scaling it isn't as clear. Not suggesting a problem, just you haven't given any directions on doing it.\\- Are there unit tests? What's the testing strategy?\\- Looks like transforming comes before validating. The code makes sense, but to me this part feels off somehow, because upgrading data is often a reaction to validating it. At least that's how my head works. \\- Saw your bullets for possible future work. Do you plan to support XML, object JSON (as opposed to JSONL), or even SQL tables? Document-oriented validation is pretty different from row-oriented validation, but there's a need for this kind of thing for both. CsvPath is definitely looking at XML, JSONL, JSON, and EDI.\\- Who do you see as the user? What kinds of businesses and use cases are you targeting? How do you motivate adoption?\\- What made you build this? What situation did you see?\\- How does the performance look on gigabyte-scale files? I could see parallelizing this kind of like a spark job. But, given the validations it looks like you're doing, you could also load data into a sql engine and transform the validations to SQL behind the scenes. There are probably lots of ways to go. What are you thinking?\\- How do you position this project vis-a-vis the ETL/ELT and orchestration tools?",

For two main reasons, they are not the funny part :) and i am not a software developer. So, the testing strategy Is very hand made. I Just create many CSV files, everyone with the errors and rules i want to test and the system must trasform or validate as i excpect. \\- mmm i could answer in many ways to this point of validating before or after. In my head you can do as many number of validation/trasformation steps you want In the order you want. You can validate-> trasform or trasform -> validate, but also validate->trasform-> validate. Obviously for every step Is necessary a regisitry with the validation or trasformation istructions. Theorically the cases are infinite, and who knows that before you knows somthing Is right you need a trasformation before.\\- in relation of xml and Json i am currently thinking about It. But for the moment i decided the focus myself on the easiest case structured data.\\- i think can be helpful to: - consultants receive data from customer recurrently a template like that permit you tò do a data inspection and cleaning and send back a generated report that explain why the data are not valid. I worked as consulant and this tool could save me time in the past. - a machine learning (time series) model could not work well if there Is a hole of 3 months of data (situation really happened). What can we do? Block the ingestion and wait for human inspection before training.- in a enterprise appropriate solution, in every situation there Is a shared and strict agreement, on how data should be received or sent. Like in companies where i worked in.\\- when you talk about large scale system i think you mean creating an appropriate enterprise solution annd not somthing running locally on a personal laptop. I have some ideas about the future developments, but as you said there are lot of ways to go.",

You would also need a grant detail table for timestamped grants with reference to the header table. This detail table will also show the conformed user id associated with that specific grant. 3. Similarly add other tables based on the available entities. Add tables to track Financials, End of Period, Beginning of Period stuff. Basic DB setup and modeling. After all of these cleaning and organizing, once data is ready, building dashboard should not be a problem. You may star with less number of table at first, but breaking down data into a normalized form will help you with traceability. Have fun, with some experience you will build these models pretty quick in future, initial one may take time. Best of luck.",

The system was a bit slow and the semantic layer file kept getting bigger lol Edit -Later we moved everything into Snowflake intelligence. Still getting refined everyday but works pretty good, low maintenance. None of these systems went to production, these are available to general users who has an itch to check out the data on their own.

        "body": "Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. They may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. But what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like \"Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does\" or \"explain line 149 to me.\" I've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. If AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like \"this class uses a singleton pattern to do x\" you can follow up with \"what the heck is a Singleton?\"If the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.Navigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it. Lastly, you might be getting to a point where you should learn about common architectural patterns like OOP, SOLID, Dependency Injection, Layered Architecture, Clean Code, etc. Not all at once, of course.",

        "body": "Most of my job these days is reading other peoples code, figuring out what it does, identifying potential issues, and documenting what I find. I rarely have documentation, and almost never have any sort of design document. My trick is to try to find a \"start\". In the language/environment I'm in, this is often an API Map or API router. Then I start drawing or creating a map of the code flow. I'll usually start with listing classes/methods (it works in my environment) and essentially making a class map, but for methods. What parameters, can I quickly guess what it does by the name or the code? What does it return? And then I get any methods or objects that method creates or calls. I work down that list. Essentially figuring out where I am in the web of function and method calls. As far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into \"make a PB&J sandwich steps\" like this:If my pseudocode looks like this: int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){ int[] retArr; for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){ retArr[i]=i+pAddToI; } return retArr; }I might write:**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object**Params:****Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.**Returns:** Integer array**Process**: 1) Creates a integer array for return2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. 3) Returns retArr---------If there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up. Look at documentation, ask co-workers. My language is not indexed well by any AI (proprietary language, most of the documentation is hidden behind paywalls), and sometimes I do have to talk to *gasp* real people or RTFM. But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.I usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom \"Calls\" and \"CalledBy\" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents. My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a \"model\" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). The benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code. Even reading single methods and writing them out, in \"make a pb&j sandwich steps\" will help in the long run. It's certainly time consuming, and reading code and writing it down like this helps you learn how to read code more quickly.",

The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called \"TLS termination\", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS. You'd do this if you don't trust the network infrastructure in the data center, e.g. because it runs a co-location server model where the server hardware owned by different entities is deployed within the same physical location.",

I'll say, learning now is 100x easier than I remember, probably because the Internet wasn't as much of a thing back then.I did some Ruby to start, because I thought I wanted to make websites and it seemed like a good entry language. About a month in, I decided I didn't really need a website for anything, so I had no motivation. Shortly after, I switched to c# and then learned Unity, so I could more easily see the results of my work. It's been very rewarding, and I'm having lots of fun. But don't get me wrong, there are some times where I search for a simple answer to a question, and I have to go read a lot of docs or ask other questions to even understand what the other answers meant. I haven't considered turning my codding hobby into a career, maybe one day, but for now it's been keeping my mind engaged.

Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!I'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.But this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.See, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption. > nc -l 8080 -c your_serverSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.You want that shit encrypted? > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'It's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.As for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!So now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.Continued...",

Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?Unit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.As far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.So that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.There's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an \"if\" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.There are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.Finally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.Testing systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",

Do you check the input before the calculation and exit gracefully?

What is the domainIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.Once there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.Second, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.Data processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you \"manually\" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.While 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.",

        "body": ">For example if you have a function that calculates the square root of a number, it's quite easy to unit test. But is that really necessary?Well you know its supposed to calculate the square root of a number, someone else might see the function and think it just devides by 3 because they put in 9 and 3 came out but now they put in 16 and it doesnt work so they \"fix\" the function so it devides by 3. Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output. So you write a unittest to make sure if someone changes the function to fit their usecase they see that something else now is broken.>What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?Well again simple to understand/debug/modify code doesnt equal just one possible expected output.>And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.Thats something each dev or each team needs to decide on their own and depends on the projekt. Think about what happens if that piece of code fails and how likely it is to fail. If the code fails and people die you wanna absolutly test as much as you can. If you are using that code to turn on an LED on a personal project well no cares if it fails. For me personaly on the current project the goal is to have atleast a unittest so that every piece of code is atleast called once. So if you have an if somewhere in there (that depends on the input) you need two write two unittests so that both sides are called. >Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?Per function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail. But you also dont have to choose just once scope. You can do some unit test for functions, for groups of functions and the class at the same time.",

Then you fulfil the test with an implementation.The test aids you in knowing if your implementation works and also remains in case someone in the future breaks the code.Where possible, I would recommend writing a test for a function/method, implement it and then do the same for every edge-case you can think of for that function/method. It simply boxes in the solution, leaving as little place for bugs as possible (but we’re only human).In some sense the tests are more important than the solution. You could keep the tests, delete the implementation, start from scratch and the tests will still ensure the new implementation works as expected and make the development even quicker than the first time. If your tests aren’t doing that then I would maybe have a rethink.",

Before I went to uni, I mostly knew C and C++, and a bit of Python; at uni, I picked up Java and a lot more Python (and did some hacking on the Python interpreter, which means C…and was briefly exposed to more languages like ARM assembly, Prolog, and others); an early job was in PHP, which I basically didn’t know at all until I started; and for the past number of years, I’ve done very well in my career with mostly Typescript. Plus of course bits and pieces of other things like bash scripts and what not.For the most part, programming is programming and the specific language doesn’t matter so much. Until you get into ‘weird’ languages (in different directions: assembly, Scheme, Haskell…), *most* of the skills will transfer. Most of the skills have to do with problem-solving and structural aspects that don’t depend all that much on language.All of which is to say that you can’t go too far wrong. C++ is fine. Java is fine. Python is fine. Typescript is fine. Rust and Go are fine. In your career, you’ll probably use it—and then go many years without even seeing it.Do make sure to pick up SQL somewhere along the way, though. Regardless of the main language used in a system, there’s a pretty good chance that *something* at your job will require you to interact with databases using SQL, which is a *very* different experience from imperative languages with Algol-family syntax, and initially not very intuitive. (There are many dialects of SQL, so whatever you learn at first, you’ll have to learn more nuances later; but the basics are consistent across tons and tons of DB systems.)",

Assume there will be a dispute, and plan accordingly. Perhaps: \"Scope of research. This work builds on top of open source project published by the following authors under these licenses... See individual files for authorship. \" or \"Statement of dependencies: the authors acknowledge use of the following projects, whose authorship is retained. Where otherwise unstated, novel work builds on top of these.\" A mention in the introduction or even in the abstract would be good too. Most importantly, make sure to add a formal academic citation in a bibliography.From the author of the original work's point of view, read their docs. If they're unclear, ShadCN supports copy and paste as a feature - take a look at their guidance. https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui I think authorship and the MIT license just need to be included.Otherwise, from a coding point of view, can't you do better than copy and pasting?

You would typically use a compiler and HLL unless you wanted to do something very hardware-specific that you couldn't get at via a HLL like C. E.g. setting up hardware via registers (like a bootloader or OS would), using very specific features directly (e.g. hand-rolling SIMD like in ffmpeg codec impls) etc.The applications of reading it are wider, e.g. performance (where it matters at this level), verifying compiler output e.g. did you hit some UB and give the compiler carte blanche to \"optimise\" your code in an unintended way? etc.It's also not that difficult to pick up the basics if you already know how a computer works, so a skill well worth having if you're interested enough. You probably won't write anything in it at work outside of specific job roles.Edit to say: ARMv8 (and ARM in general) has slightly less historical weirdness and is easier to learn that amd64 IMO, if you want to buy a cheap arm SoC or you have a Mac with apple silicon.

You may or may not use that knowledge directly to build fault tolerant systems but the skills you gained on how to think about a problem and judging trade offs is somewhat transferable when building projects/products.So both go hand in hand one way or another. But this is just a recent discovery for my own experience. I cannot generalize this.

As someone who hires programmers now, I can tell you for people who dont have much background, the college and degree helps. This would apply to all my friends who have to hire people also (in different companies too, most are college friends who also hire programmers a lot)",

In the past, when CS was new, you could have other backgrounds like math or a CS minor.* **Remedial MS** OK, that's not it's real name, but this is basically a short undergrad degree that disguises itself as a Masters. It assumes any undergrad degree, and tries to compress a CS degree in 2 years with some \"grad\" courses that are much lighter on math. Still, it can fool some folks that it's a classical MS degree.* **Professional MS degree** Aimed at working programmers that want a few more courses, but not as theoretical. Probably less common than the others.This is a US-centric view of the degrees. These days there are specialized MS degrees that do not lead to a PhD, so kinda professional? MS degrees in AI, cybersecurity, etc. These are often money-makers for universities because they rarely have funding for students (traditional MS degrees at a reputable research university would likely have funding to hire TAs/RAs).",

        "body": "I just started my masters in computers science this year. I am a mathematics graduate who minored in data science and computer science, enough to focus on software engineering as my full-time job.My reasons are not degree based, but content based. I find it very hard to get motivation without structured, grade-based, financially-committed learned. That is, online free MOOCs are difficult for me to complete and actually learn. The masters program definitely breaks this barrier by putting my academic reputation on the line, and hitting my wallet!In my undergrad, there were a few gaps I had being a mathematics major. I never had a formal operating systems, database, or computer networks course. Thus, my first glass is in operating systems and I'm learning a ton through the projects, including client-server programming in C, IPC (shared memory and message queues), operating system design, and so much more. Note that I am doing this while I work a full-time job as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. So I'm learning from multiple angles. My focus in my program is to learn several computer science fundamentals that I missed and some new ones, and then transitioning to some more AI/ML related topics and applications in robotics, computer vision, etc.Do I think that an official masters degree in name is worth it alone? No. Don't get the masters if it's just about getting the degree. Do I think that an official masters degree is worth it for the structured learning and content? Definitely yes. I've only been in the program for 3 months and I've already learned so much. I'll take some classes on things I'm not familiar with and some new cutting edge features in computer science. Now there are some careers I'm interested in that start with having an advanced degree, but it's more of a convenience that I'll get that requirement than it is a motivating factor.Will it help your job outlook? Maybe, but it depends on what you take from it. If you have a masters or undergrad in computer science, but can't program anything or speak on certain subjects, you likely won't get the job. Believe it or not, this is a common thing that happens. This is the reason why cheating and similar is discouraged. Not just because it is dishonest, but because you won't learn anything by researching documentation and spending hours trying different things out. That's where the learning happens.The masters program I am in is Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). From what I understand, this program is very welcoming to non-CS undergrads, but you need to be able to speak on your abilities to accept the intense CS workload. If you don't know a single thing about computer science or programming, you won't succeed. Luckily, there are plenty of programs out there to get up to speed and demonstrate some basic (non-exhaustive) requirements before entering the program.Good luck, hope this helps.",

Did work in ML side before as well.Neither.AI needs PhD.Data Science unless you want to do modern day applied statistics, I really wouldn't. Also, you generally need a master's for a lot of those jobs here. I would focus more generic Computer Science undergrad then decide specialization at master's.And quite frankly if you are considering Data Science or AI, just go straight for ML then. That's the in between. That's probably what you are thinking. Actual AI jobs are for PhDs. And Data Science teams are some of the first to get removed when companies lay off employees.(personally for me)* Which would you choose today if you were starting fresh? * I would say to avoid data science or front end. Those two are generally in for rough times. * I would heavily consider C++ and focus on Operating Systems, Networking, Databases, Robotics (+ Computer Vision). It's a niche language but there's also very little talent in that space. And it opens you up to robotics, firmware optimizations, autonomous vehicles, military weapons, high frequency trading firms, AR/VR applications, game development, platforms like Figma.* How's the job market overall comparing between these two? * AI needs PhD. What you are thinking is ML. ML generally needs Master's as well and pays the biggest premium currently but is also very very competitive. * Data Science needs Master's and generally the talent is quite flooded because the talent bar is overall lower in that field. And some of the first in chopping blocks in a market downturn. Hence I would personally avoid it unless you really like Data Science.* Any regrets or \"wish-I-knew\" advice before committing to one path? * I wish I studied Operating Systems in school.To be quite frank though, do what you like. All these fields are fine if you are willing to put in the hours and keep learning. I'm a web dev today. And it seems for web dev world, it's now expected with LLMs that Backend Engineers do fullstack. Note I said Backend doing full stack, not Frontend.When I look at job requirements today, a lot of employees are looking for one/two of: full stack (who is backend main - typescript + java/python), Go, C++/Rust.It does feel C++ is more futureproof though as the language forces one to actually understand how memory, pointers, etc works under the hood. And realistically most students will run away from actually learning C++ in life.",

For example, if you’re faced with a *pigeonhole-type* problem, you can simply reach into your bag of knowledge for *combinatorics* and tackle it confidently.You don't need to be a genius. Failing to solve the pigeonhole problem doesn't mean you're dumb, you just lacked the necessary piece that you needed to solve the puzzle. I received a C in maths in school and would consider myself average. When I first started my undergraduate, I was very good at programming but my limiting factor was that my underlying knowledge of maths was lacking.I picked up one of those fat textbooks with a thousand pages on Discrete Mathematics and studied the shit out of that over the course of 3 months by reading and grasping the concepts, practicing questions and implementing knowledge. After I finished the book, I could shamelessly brag that I became a better programmer out of it, and not a single line of code was involved.",

One daughter who really loved \"programming\" in scratch took a Python class and decided coding wasn't for her. She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around. Don't get me wrong, the understanding kids can get from a tool like Scratch is helpful for things like understanding program flow and conditionals, but \"real\" programming--even game programming--isn't like that. I don't know how your particular nine-year-old is wired, but seeing what's involved in actual code couldn't hurt, IMO. So it's a chance to see if he's really interested. And plenty of kids play Minecraft, which isn't peak graphics, so I wouldn't focus too much on that.I think picking something relatively straightforward is a good plan. You might also make sure that you understand how all the libraries you'll be using work and have maybe tested them out a little (in case you've forgotten something since the last times you used them).

So much documentation to wade through. Although, LLMs can probably help with these things nowadays.I'm a C# person myself, and I love the language and the environment, I am most productive with it. I occasionally work with Python for scripting and Javascript / Typescript is a must when working with frontend stuff. I have used C++ rarely when doing embedded stuff (Raspberry Pi) and some other things like emulators, but getting things like graphics and libraries and UI was a hindrance to me being able to do what I wanted to do.C# jobs were plenty, but now it can be difficult to get into among the sea of applicants.",

        "body": "Well I don't know what things are like now or will be like two years from now... I'll say that I learned both C++ and Java in college and nobody ever paid me to code in either of them, instead, all of my jobs were in languages that weren't taught in my colleges at all. While I can't see the future and advice is a dangerous thing, there's a good chance that you could learn C++ now and get a job in Java later or learn Java now and get a job in C++ later. Or learn both now and get a job using some other language later. Or learn both now and get a job using both later.Again, though, I learned those languages a quarter of a century ago and I don't know what things are like today. It was fun to learn both of them.Another thing I will say from my own experience... without actually doing a specific type of coding as a job it was hard for me to predict what I would or wouldn't like. Most coding I found enjoyable even if I assumed I wouldn't before-hand. So perhaps you would love being a backend engineer. For me, it was very hard to predict. I had to work on real projects with real people to actually know what I liked. I'm not sure if that will be the same experience for you or not or how common that is with others.I do get that there's jobs that will have requirements like \"Minimum years experience with \" and I can get why one would want to pick the \"right\" language as a result. I don't really agree with these requirements as a good C++ programmer should be able to be productive in Java in a week and rather proficient in a month and (mostly) vice-versa. I don't feel like you're ever really more than a couple months behind if you pick the \"wrong\" stuff to learn with.So, those are my thoughts. If you are enjoying C++, I really can't make an argument for you to not learn C++. Or just learn both at the same time. Personally, I feel like I got more out of learning Java than C++. This is because I already knew C and so learning low-level stuff wasn't as crucial for me, and I felt like the types of software-engineering challenges I personally like revolve more around managing domain complexity in which case a higher-level language lets me be a bit more focused on the stuff I like. But you could be the opposite. Only you can really know.I will also say... and maybe I'm wrong about this expectation... but I feel like university students, at least by the 2nd year, should probably be able to learn any language necessary on their own quickly without it being the main focus of a course (maybe I'm wrong about this, though.) Meaning, at that point, the language is irrelevant and not what the teacher is actually trying to teach. It's just a vessel for teaching the real lessons. I think one has to get past the language-learning part and into the deeper software-engineering challenges and other concepts at play. Not the syntax/mechanics of a specific programming language. I think learning programming languages themselves is something you should just be able to do rather quickly as-needed/desired. Along those lines, if the question is... I can take a CS course taught by teacher A using language X, or the same exact course but by teacher B using language Y, I really don't think it matters that much to be honest. If X and Y are Java and C++ then just pick C++ if you predict it will make the class more enjoyable. Whether teacher A is better at teaching than teacher B is probably more important, actually. But, I think there's a good chance you might learn the actual lessons of the course better using Java than C++ so if you really can't make up your mind I suppose I would recommend Java for that reason but my suspicion is that I don't think it will matter much in the grand scheme of things and that it's not as crucial of a decision as it seems to be at the moment.Not sure if good advice but that's my experience with this stuff.",

Being a bit cynical, I felt this was the industry's attempt to get software people to work harder to be more productive.It's like saying a barista (the person that makes coffee) has to be passionate, tasting and making coffee at home like it's a mission.And, even passion only gets you so far. Andre Agassi, the tennis star, said he hated tennis in his early years, and yet was a top 10 player through much of his career. There are guys desperate to be in the NBA. They practice as much as the stars, but all that passion doesn't translate to talent or height or raw athletic skill. It gets to the point where those who struggle to program still proclaim how much they \"love programming\" and are so passionate. What happens to the passionate non-achiever? We might say it's \"fake passion\".It *can* just be a job. You don't have to code on weekends. If someone studies and figures something new out, well, you have ChatGPT.

All it will do is that companies demand even larger and more complex software systems managed by even fewer people. But ai can't even understand what a loop or a function is. It can only regurgitate patterns in code it saw on some repo. And you can't trust an llm. Just wait until someone uses an llm to generate thousands of repos that all contain the same vulnerability just so that enough llms get trained on that and generated code used in companies will have the same vulnerability in their code. Then what? We already have no control over out dependencies as seen in recent supply chain attacks. I'm sure it will be used a lot for tools where it actually makes sense and maybe nvidia has some good technology for that. We can use machine learning for lots of things. But we do not have AGI.

You could also do it in pure code and a Hello World GUI app would only be 20 - 30 lines of code or so.If you use Electron, you're basically building a web page using HTML+CSS+JavaScript and Electron runs an embedded web browser inside your app window. It will look like a web page inside of an app window. If you're already good at web development or you want to learn web development this will be very convenient. If not, it will feel more complex to get things up and running because you'll need HTML, CSS, frontend JavaScript, and backend JavaScript.Electron makes a ton of sense if you want a website and a desktop app. You can share most of the code. There are similar frameworks that let you build mobile apps and share a lot of the code too.Coming from Python and Tkinter, C# with WinUI will feel more familiar and just more polished and powerful.

Your job prospects would be very different.Generally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.Computer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. Since it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.To go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things. Keep in mind the job market for CS grads is fucked right now but that applies to data science too so given your age you might want to reconsider. I’m not trying to discourage you from CS, I’m a CS student myself, you just have less time to wait around for that six figure job. CS is no longer finish the degree and get that six figure offer right out of uni, it takes time and extracurricular experience now just like any other degree.In your position I’d look at r/cscareerquestions and decide if that’s something you’d be willing to deal with (it’s the worst of the worst scenarios but you get the point). Then I would say do a CS degree with a minor in data science. That opens all the doors: CS as a new grad, data analysis type roles, and grad school for either discipline should you want to do that.So yeah that’s my ted talk.Edit: I also unfortunately should say that with the job market getting a degree from a random community college or even a random state school won’t cut it anymore, prestige really matters now which sucks.",

        "body": "The main difference I'd say between courses is CS is more general while AI and DS will be more focused. I did CS and my degree had AI and Data Science in it, but it also had more general topics like software engineering and more abstract maths. AI and DS would probably be very good for AI and DS but not have as much other stuff in it. In a CS degree you'll have the chance to make it more data heavy if you want but you may not get the opportunity to do the same thing the other way round. I don't think your job prospects will be very different. They'd probably be better with straight CS since it's more general but I also don't think a company hiring for a CS position would reject someone for doing AI and DS instead. They're close enough and you're probably taking enough shared classes between them that it won't make much difference.",

So to take your factorial number, what is 7! ? It’s 7 * 6!. n! = n * (n-1)! So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)def factorial(int n):return n * factorial(n-1)Now, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block. TLDR, when writing a recursive function, act as if you already have the function working",

        "body": "A lot of the time, I find refactoring a solution really valuable. By either eliminating distractions or drilling down into the details, I can often cross the intuition gap.Using recursion as an example, let's say that I've seen the code```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```So, let's analyze: I can see exactly what happens when `$n == 1` and `$n == 2`. The default case, however, recurses, and it's not clear what that means. I can do a refactoring, making the code worse in order to look at it in more detail. For example, I can add the `$n == 3` case explicitly:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```Since I've already determined what `fib(1)` and `fib(2)` are, I now know exactly what happens with `fib(3)`.And I can keep doing this, substituting the value of subexpressions into cases to see how the expansion would work. By the time I'm at `fib(6)`, that expansion looks like this:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } when 4 { return (fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2) } # fib(3) + fib(2) when 5 { return ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1)) } # fib(4) + fib(3) when 6 { return (((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))) + ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) } # fib(5) + fib(4) default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```By making what each recursive call does explicit, I can see the relationship between the last line and the lines before it. And I can see that in every case, the subexpressions are simpler than the overall expression and lead inevitably to the base cases.Anyway. That's one technique. Might work for you, might not. But it's how I do.",

It is that strain that allows them to build muscles. Your brain is the same.So, generally, the harder you can make things on your brain without making it so hard that you quit, the better. If things feel buttery smooth and easy you're likely not learning anything.",

Guy was talking about accessing the registers on the whatever passed for a GPU at that time. Direct hardware access to make a side scroller run smoother is just crazy to me.What carmack is really really good at, in his opinion is optimisation. That's his real skillset. Finding ways to make things work now that are more easily possible down the line in the future. He learned that once his programming skillset had already developed to the point of competency in assembly. He learned that with pascal & learning to structure programs. A recent interview stated that he used those lessons in learning about how data flows through his programs \"to this day\".If you want to shit yourself just have a look at how to do memory writing or reading in assembly, you'll be thankful for pointers in c.To go back around to your question: being fed enough knowledge to use it, enough to get results and enough that it doesn't overwhelm you is where it's at in terms of learning.",

Docker was just a small part of it. All docker does is containerize individual processes. You can use either your own docker “images” or install them from docker.io or other registry. Images are basically just scripts to run the application. Kubernetes is a lot more complicated to understand but it gets pretty easy once you get to the heart of it. Services are what matter in kubernetes. They take the containerized application and assign an id to them. Since kubernetes deals with multiple ports if you were to handle it traditionally you would have to manually allocate ports to reroute traffic, however services work to reroute the traffic automatically to the assigned port of your application. If you want to practice you could probably use virtualbox to create a few vms and try to connect them.",

        "body": "I am not a REST evangelist, but the STANDARD approach to REST is that an endpoint set should refer to a RESOURCE, and a good litmus test for that is \"can I assign an ID to it without it getting weird\". And then you spread CRUD operations (create read update delete) across the verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for that resource. If you're more familiar with SQL, thinking about how you'd normalize the tables and what gets a primary key can kind of give you an idea what a \"resource\" or \"entity\", etc. would be.In your case, I'd probably have something more like1. POST /api/cart - CREATE a new CART2. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId} - Update metadata about the CART {cartId} (not necessarily its sub objects)3. POST /api/cart/{cartId}/item - CREATE a new item in cart {cartId}4. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId}/item/{itemId} - UPDATE an existing item in cart {cartId} with the id {itemId}. Your quantity update would go here.For the item model I'd probably have something like (BASIC) itemId // the id of the CART item productId // the id of the product in your catalog quantityNote I dont put things like PRICE, etc. in there: the PRODUCT linkage should let you get the price of the product in your catalog and do the math to present price information. You don't want to put things like that in your cart model, because it gives attackers a target to EDIT something they shouldn't, and suddenly they can update something in the cart to give it a price of $0. There are like a half dozen different suggestions about proper security design that go along with that, and I know you didn't ask about that, so I'm not going deeper.Also note that endpoint split is a little obvious for REST stuff, but there's others that aren't as obvious: like do you have an endpoint for SHIPPING information, OR is shipping information just part of a CART update call? ie:1. POST api/cart/{cartId}/shipping - \"create\" a shipping record for cart {cartId}?2. PUT api/cart/{cartId} - or just update the shipping information on the cart record itself?These judgement calls can be driven by LOTS of things. I might want to split shipping info updates to its own endpoint because the UI segregation of that operation vs other cart update operations kinda suggests it. Or because my DB design says that \"ShippingInfo\" is a 1:1 record with a Cart, and I want to adhere a bit to my data structure case, or dozens of other reasons.Another fun one, what type of endpoint would you use for a SEARCH endpoint? By REST standards its conceptually a GET, but robust search often becomes a POST out of necessity of supporting larger POST bodies. Plenty of GETs in a larger ecosystem migrate to POSTs to support request bodies too, because REST doesn't really deal with that, and you absolutely will hit a point where you have to send a body on a GET at some point because URLs can't support the size. Be pragmatic when its called for.Hell you don't HAVE to use PUT for updates. I've seen plenty of people only use POST as just \"POST is an upsert\" instead of dealing with PUTs at all, or reserving PUTs for PATCH operations and using POSTs for full object updates. REST purists will get all up in arms about that but... you should really ignore them. Almost no one does the pure thing in reality.",

The _cart_ is the resource routed at /cart/{id} and the action you’re performing is a custom action addQuantity. I used a google/microsoft-ish convention for custom actions, but you could also do /cart/{id}/addQuantity (but this is a little less RESTful because addQuantity is an _action_ not a resource) or PATCH /cart/{id} (if you know the current quantity and can just PATCH in the correct new value).",

In the specific case of `gcc`, `-l[library]` is literally just searching a pre-configured (or specified on the command line) list of directories for a file named `lib[library].a` or `lib[library].so`. So as long as you know what your library files are named, you know what name to give to GCC.

Instead, build systems such as [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) or [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) are used, which can take care of this for you.

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.To reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.The linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. In order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for. You see, in their infinite wisdom, the people who created this concept forgot that it would probably have been a good idea to either keep the name of the necessary library files *in the header file* somewhere. Instead, you have to read the documentation to figure these things out yourself.",

He covers this dilemma, among other things, but one of the core principles of learning something deeply is to learn it directly. In other words, you should try to learn something in as close as its real-world application (whatever that means for you) as possible. What that looks like in real life is tackling that problem/project/assignment much earlier than when you feel ready. When you hit the concepts that you don't know is a signal to drill down *JUST ENOUGH* to overcome the hurdle in what you are currently doing. This means you will spend a lot of time in that uncomfortable space but what is often left unsaid is that is the exact space that learning solidifies. In fact a lot of the times the comfortable space is a lie; we trick ourselves into believing because we read and/or took notes on something we understand it, but the truth is if that knowledge is not applied it will decay extremely quickly.",

This can be achieved in many ways, such as making sure that the code has good separation of concerns and using dependency injection patterns.Two, have good test coverage to ensure everything works as expected and no regression bugs are introduced. Note that you'll probably never get 100% coverage using automated tests, so manual testing will still be needed.",

Error monitoring in your production apps will also help you see when you've released a new error that wasn't caught by your testing.An incremental approach to upgrades lets you focus on one change at a time, instead of changing everything at once. This is safer and less stressful than trying to update everything at once. For example, many times when updating a library or framework, there will be some deprecated functions - like version 9 of some library contained theOldWay and theNewWay, and either one worked. Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changesOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",

The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.Then you execute.Sometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.You also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",

        "body": "As a college graduate - I don't care what language you learned in college.Introductory materials only teach you the grammar and syntax. You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is \"yes\", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you \"know\", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore. What you'll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.",

But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.There are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:The code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.On the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",

I, for example, would much rather write system plumbing than mess around with web browser JavaScript. Neither of them is more \"real\" programming than the other.Now, let's talk about software engineering, which might be what you're thinking of when you say \"programming\". It's a different discipline that **involves** programming but is mostly defined by turning programs that work well enough that they solve **your** problem into products that can solve the problem for more people. It very well might be that you would not like doing that. I do: I like figuring out how to make people's lives easier, which usually starts with helping them understand what is making their lives hard. I like a perfectly-tuned deployment that is memorialized by nothing but a line in a changelog somewhere.

It's a subset of programming, where you typically create small programs for automation or change* the behavior of something else. A square vs rectangle situation, so lines get blurred. Python is a high-level language, just like VBA, so you can only ever use it for scripting if you want.However, since Python is also a general-purpose language, you can do things far beyond what VBA is limited to, digging deeper into what you call \"programming.\"",

It really doesn't matter, except that scripting is sometimes associated with people who lack comprehensive programming skills and often just copy and paste code without truly understanding why it works. Programming is more associated with the capability to write a full program from scratch and understand every bit of it. Also, sometimes scripting is the label when you are required to code more in short bursts, like attaching a little bit of code to some object like an event. It gets more into ego, and personal preference usually. What matters is that you are effectively writing code not really so much what you'd like it called.",

Solve some problems that require you to think algorithmically (Advent of Code is one of my favorites) and practice DSA with those questions and you'll be good. The key to learning DSA, in my opinion, is not just how to write an algorithm it in a programing language, but understanding the underlying concept. So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you're good to go and you shouldn't worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says \"sort this array using bubble sort\", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you're not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course. That's usually what I like to do, make sure I can analyze and explain the concept BEFORE I implement it in code.",

But I'd expect anyone who is a competent programmer to be able to sit for a second, think about what they need to do and what order they need to do it in, and then go and start working it out. Even if you never went to college and never learned about graphs, if you're decently smart and have had graphs explained to you, it shouldn't take you long to figure out an approach that works.Most DSA questions are really two parts - \"What approach will solve this problem?\" and then \"How do I implement that?\" And both come from practice.",

The toolchains are good and the target machines, C64, Apple II have enough features without being too complex and are well documented.Tools like the [8bitworkshop browser-based IDE](https://8bitworkshop.com) mean you can dip your toe without having to install any software.Good luck !",

The features available in ARM7 aren't so overwhelming that you need to worry about advanced instructions you'll find in x86.As for fundamentals you want to make sure you understand - try to find some good resources that explain registers, addresses accumulators - it might be easier to start with a simpler microprocessor like an 8051/Z80, just to keep things simple and not overwhelm yourself. A lot of universities would start with M68k, which I think is too complex to throw people at as a very baseline beginner architecture.",

I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of \"create a program that does X, Y, Z\" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of \"I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so\".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book. You need to put what you're researching into practice, without it, it won't do you much good.Good luck in your adventures",

You kind of design your classes with constructors and methods, while thinking: \"Oh, and it would be nice if I could just write code like ...\"Example:If you want your student-admin system to be able to be written like: Student student1 = new Student(\"John\", 13, 7); // John is 13 years old in grade 7. student1.takeClasses(\"English\", \"Maths\", \"P.E\", \"Home Economics);Then you need a constructor that takes just the name, age and grade, as well as a method for taking a number of classes.If you also want to be able to write something like: Student student2 = new Student(\"Jane\"); student2.setAge(14); student2.takeClass(\"English Litt.\"); student2.takeClass(\"Woodworking\");Then you also need a constructor that only takes the name - as well as a method for taking a single (additional) class and add to the list of classes.So there are rarely any right or wrong answers - you simply build your classes so you make it as easy as possible to write the rest of the code the way you want!",

Bookmark that manual and start reading it as fast as you can. Then I'd see if that game engine has a YouTube channel or somewhere where they're posting free engine learning content, possibly their own website, and I'd pick a couple of their 'how to make game x' or 'how to make game y' series (usually varies by genre), and watch it about 3.5 times-5.7 times.

To simplify: language exceptions are things thrown within the language by language statements, machine exceptions are things like \"divide by zero\" which are generated by the processor.There's then two additional pieces of machinery:- when a machine exception happens, the OS can pass it to the process to handle. On Unix this is done with signals. If there is no handler, the process will crash. - But if there is a handler, it can convert a machine exception into a language exception, which can then be caught. This happens in most managed languages - Python, Java, C# etc.C and C++ generally do not provide such handlers. Microsoft does have a mechanism called \"structured exception handling\" on Windows which lets you do this, but there's a high risk of the program ending up in an inconsistent state.",

But if it is an exception, it breaks out of the try-block, and jumps straight to the catch-block. Kind of like you can `break` out of a while-loop.I like to think of the try-catch like an if-else, where the try-block is like: \"if everything goes well\", and the catch-block is like \"else do this\" - with the crazy change that you can break out of the \"if\" and jump into the \"else\", unlike normal program flow.I know that these comparisons aren't correct - but they do help me understand how to write the code, and what to expect to happen. Would be interesting to actually understand what really goes on, though :)",

The simple route is that the \"try\" key word tells your CPU to store a copy of its current state somewhere. If an error flag gets flipped after some error-raising operation (they typically store this in your eax register I believe), your CPU cracks open whatever buffer it stored that original state in, and copies all of the non-error-filled values, before effectively hitting a goto statement to the next valid catch block. If you don't have anything in that buffer, you crash. Alternatively, you can implement these using metadata handling, manually unwinding the execution stack to look for a valid catch block before jumping to it.",

Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by \"completely\"? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql \"completely\" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",

You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: \"Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article. Let's open all models regarding bookmarks and articles, the endpoints files, the signals and start looking if we can find what we are looking for anywhere in there.\"",

This is connected to the fact, that the frontend is very visual. The backend works on data: You get a request, you react to that request ba returning data of some kind, often after running multiple layers of checks (authentication, authorization) and fetching data from a database. You might like both, but I would still suggest that you stay with frontend for a while, at least until you are pretty well rounded there. Afterwards you can try backend and decide, if you want to pursue both (fullstack) or even switch over to backend. You seem to have the best learning strategy already figured out: 1. learn a little bit of theory2. apply that theory and incorporate everything else you already know3. repeatIf you want something with a set curriculum, go take a look at the odin project [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) . I have not taken it myself, but I have heard good things. The Foundations -> JavaScript Path looks good to me.

When starting out, this is the perfect way to learn.>Any must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?I would not waste too much time looking for a perfect roadmap, instead just continue with what you are doing.For example, now that you are learning HTML and CSS.I would also take a look at learning some JavaScript and jQuery.Look into using one or two of the CSS frameworks like CSS Flexbox or Bootstrap etc.And for that learning process, do exactly what you have already done. Find some information on these topics and then try to turn that information into working code. The things you create don't need to be big projects. Simple things will do, but it is important that you fully understand everything you create. That understanding is what is difficult, as you may have to spend time researching the bits that you don't understand.But if you do this for month, you should find you are suddenly getting confident in these topics.At that point, once you have that confidence, that is would be the perfect time to start looking for more advanced topics to learn. PS: Since you are getting into HTML make sure you watch a few videos using this YouTube search topic: **browser dev tools**.",

Just look up Triangle Numbers.But is it possible the input doesn’t follow that interpretation of a “sequential number” and could be 234? Or 1679? If so, that formula won’t help you and you likely do need a loop. Since they’re not allowing you to cast to a string you need a mathematical solution. One that loops through each “place” (1s place, 10s place etc) and gets each value to sum together.IMO the question as you’ve described it above is a little ambiguous but I’m not sure if that’s how it was presented to you verbatim or not.",

So, i = 123, n = 3, and the result is 6.As you explained, it is n+1 more than g(2). In this case n is 2 and 2+1 is the 3 from above. The last number to add is just \"n\". However, there's a trick. More on that later.You could use recursion here, but that's not necessary. But just for fun:g(4) = 4 + g(3) Or more generally (for natural numbers): g(1) = 1 g(n) = n + g(n-1)Now it's just simple maths. I hope you like maths.g(n) = n + g(n-1) g(n) = n + (n-1) + g(n-2)g(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + g(n-3) If n is 4 then g(n-3) = 1 g(4) = 4 + (4-1) + (4-2) + g(4-3) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1OK, so far it checks out. But that didn't help. So let's so some more analysis:1 12 123 1234 12345That looks like a triangle. So, it's like a right-angled triangle with a side length of 5. Duplicate and flip it:1 54321 12 4321 123 321 1234 21 12345 15 rows with 6 digits. f(5) = 5\\*6=30 But we copied the triangle, so f(5) = 30/2 = 15It works with",

Learning unity and game design are kind of separate tasks. Both of those you won't learn if you go through a general programming learning path. But data structures, algorithms, and object oriented programming will all be important for the coding side of game dev. It might be tempting to skip past the general programming knowledge part of the journey, but its still really important. It will at least give you a base that you can build upon.Online courses and youtube tutorials are mostly fine. Especially since they can be more game dev focused. I'd also look into C# textbooks. You can find really good ones online. Completely unrelated anecdote, but when I was getting my CS degree I don't think I paid for a textbook once. Thanks google.",

Java is a great language with great libraries and a wonderful ecosystem. Your programming skills might be very good already, but still.If you switch to e.g. Python, you're entering a fairly different world. Sure, *programming* itself stays mostly the same, but the *approach* to *implementation* is vastly different to Java. In such cases, I commonly recommend to drop your ego and start with a beginner course. You can breeze through the early parts fairly quick, but when it comes to details and the \"Pythonic\" approach, you will quickly learn that the Java way doesn't translate well.",

From memory, these are drawn on the UML diagram using solid or dashed lines.The 'has a' relationship can also be of differing types, for example 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to many' etc. Again, from memory, these can be captured on the UML diagram using circles, triangles and other symbols.The UML is just simple diagram that allows the OOD to be captured on a piece of paper. That is all there is to it.The harder part is learning the OOD itself, but that too is not overly complicated as it is about things like attributes, visibility, methods, abstractions, encapsulation, relationships, polymorphism etc.**EDIT**: I used properties in my description. Google suggests using the term attributes instead.",

Also, don't worry about not being a significant code contributor yet. It generally takes ~6mo-1yr for someone to be fully self-sufficient. You can contribute by asking questions when you don't understand something. That will help you to learn and also help spark dialogue that can sometimes lead to change/improvements. It's not uncommon for someone to ask, \"Why do we do it this way instead of this other way?\" And the result being a new ticket to improve on a process because explaining the answer made the team realize there was now a better way.",

Now the key here is not to Google the entire problem, but rather just the parts or aspects you're stuck on, as this simulates how you would solve real world problems that can't be googled.For example, say you're tasked with sorting the letters in an arbitrary string, and are required to return a string with all the same characters but sorted in alphabetical order using X programming language. In this case, you might Google:- (1) how to iterate over the characters of a string in X- (2) how to compare two characters in X- (3) how to keep a count of every character in X- (4) how to dynamically create and add to a new string in X.You might even look up what the best algorithm or structure to accomplish something is",

Once you understand the concepts from one langauge/framework, you can transfer a lot of it over to another one if you decide to down the line, so its not like you have to make the absolute perfect choice right now.Express is a great one to start with because it is relatively barebones, in that it handles the important parts of the HTTP request and response but also doesn’t require a lot of work to get going which is great if this is your first time making a backend. Also because of how popular JS is in web development you should be able to find answers to most questions that pop up for Express (not that Go is unpopular by any means)",

This is how \"is-a\" relationships are usually considered.)3. That bird is colored red. (Object-property value. Aristotle might have called it quality or even quantity. It's confusing because it's an is-a in English.)4. A bird is feathered and winged. (Class-property. Describes features of an object but not necessarily the values. Belongs more to Plato than to Aristotle but Ari might have still said it's part of the substance of the thing.)So yes, by answer number two. But that's not what you're asking.

Going back to your art example, I might know how to use a paint brush, I might know how to mix two paint colors together to get something new, but I might not know how a brush is made from scratch or what the individual pigments that go into a paint color are. Sometimes it helps, maybe one pigment reacts differently in certain conditions, and not knowing that might catch you off guard. But, it's not _required_ knowledge, most of the time. Good luck, hang in there. I remember feeling this way too, but I can't pinpoint a singular thing that got me over it. I think it was just stubbornness? I tend to go \"fuck it, IDC if it exists or if it's slow, I just wanna make the thing and see it work\". Slowly but surely, you start picking up new skills. At times they feel distinct and disjointed, but sooner than later they'll click. Another thing try is to view your initial idea document as just a guideline.

The only way to avoid DSA forever is if you only build stuff like tiny one-off websites that never get a lot of users.I think of it like pilots learning to land a plane in zero visibility, or doctors learning about rare illnesses. It's not that you use this knowledge every day - it's so that when it does come up, you need to be prepared.95% of my job is exactly what you say you like - building websites, backend systems, and so on. Most of the time DSA isn't relevant.But that 5% of the time when it is, I'm really glad I know it. I know what to do when we discover one part of the code is getting too slow, or when we need to walk all of the nodes in a nested data structure.In the real world, nobody cares if you have every possible case memorized. It's fine to Google it. But you need to understand the fundamentals so that you know what to look up and you know how to use the solution when you find it.It's true that leetcode problems in interviews can be annoying and many companies do it extremely poorly. Most of us just treat that as a necessary evil. Some people just avoid those interviews and there are companies that do technical assessments of coders without ever asking leetcode problems.Competitive programming shouldn't even be mentioned, it's extremely niche. 99% of working programmers have no interest in it.",

You need at least some stuff, like knowing when to use a dictionary and when to use an array. Understanding graphs is good, too. Most real problems won't require more advanced algorithms (although some might!).That said, many programming interviews make heavy use of DSA, so being at least conversant with them is a big advantage over people who with a less prestigious education, which tends to skip over DSA stuff. For that reason, I recommend at least a bit more focus on DSA than you might otherwise prefer. You don't have to memorize the CLRS, but being able to come up with a slightly custom graph traversal on the fly could help you land your dream job.",

They’ll test your practical knowledge- things like frameworks, databases, APIs, debugging, and deployment- not abstract algorithmic puzzles.• Service-based companies (TCS, Infosys, Accenture, etc.):Here too, DSA generally isn’t a major focus. The hiring process revolves more around basic aptitude, communication, and fundamental programming or project knowledge.• Product-based companies (MAANG, etc.):For general SDE/SWE roles, DSA is very important. These roles are not tied to a specific tech stack. Once you’re in, you could be placed in any team- frontend, backend, infrastructure, data, or even something entirely new.That’s why they use DSA to evaluate your problem-solving ability and learning potential. If you can think logically and break down problems efficiently, you can adapt to any technology later.However, if you’re applying for a specific role (say, Android Developer, Data Engineer, ML Engineer, etc.), then the focus will shift more toward domain-specific concepts and tech skills. DSA might still appear in a few questions, mainly to gauge your logical thinking rather than deep algorithmic mastery.In short, you don’t need to become a DSA wizard unless you’re aiming for product-based companies’ general SDE roles- but you should still know the basics.Understanding arrays, linked lists, trees, recursion, backtracking, and a bit of dynamic programming will help you think more logically and write cleaner, more efficient code in any development role.",

This is because most jobs use mainstream programming languages, where there are many libraries, which you glue together to make something work, and those libraries themselves already use the appropriate data structure, or, if they don't, then that's too bad, but possibly not a problem until it becomes a bottleneck. Most jobs will not require you to implement a new database from scratch. You will mostly rely on things already in existence and very mature. No need to dig out your lecture notes about how to implement a B+ tree or stuff like that.However, ... If you want to have fun and explore maybe some more niche languages, then you might run into these situations, where you wish you had that one data structure that is appropriate for the situation. You might even find it interesting to write it yourself. And in very few jobs, you might even be given the chance to work with elegant but non-mainstream languages or technology stacks.Having a good grasp of data structures is and will remain respectable. For imperative data structures there is tons of code available online to work with though, and you need to know how to look up what you need and then you will be able to deal with the issue when it arises. It gets a lot more difficult to find good examples or even explanations for functional data structures. There is not that much literature, most lectures don't even touch the topic, and papers can be hard to follow/understand. That's already quite niche though.",

You're also bounding the array size, so it can't be larger than 100 elements, so we can instead create the array with a single static allocation like `int array[100] = { 0 };`. Unlike in Python, C won't check the boundaries for you, but now we know that anything trying to access `array[100]` is definitely an error.Your number handling logic may work (I didn't bother validating it), but it'd be much easier to validate if it was split into a function that took an array of N integers and sorted it according to the same rules. Then you can collect the input into an array, pass it into the sorting function to sort in-place, and write the results to stdout for the user.If you haven't yet, absolutely check out K&R (\"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie) and \"Modern C\" by Jens Gustedt.

So I put it aside and started reading a more beginner friendly book called \"C Programming Language: A Modern Approach\" by K.N King who does a great job at making C look fun.

There's not really a great use case for VLAs compared to just using `calloc(3)` when you need a dynamically allocated array of `N` items each `M` bytes large. There's not usually a significant amount of memory overhead for declaring an array of 100 ints if we know we need fewer. This can change if you start doing embedded development, but it's generally fine to have unused array space. Save worrying about memory usage and efficiency for after you're comfortable writing code in the language.2. Yeah, pointers are where things get tricky for most learners. You use them all the time in python and other languages without thinking though, like when you pass an instance of an object to a function, or use `self` in methods. C just doesn't hide those sorts of implementation details, so you have to learn them to be productive, otherwise you won't be able to solve certain problems efficiently.3. K&R may be technically outdated, but if you get the 2nd edition on ANSI C (first standardised version), it's still an excellent learning resource. Pointers will still be baffling at first, but once you start messing with them more it should start to make sense.Fun fact: your sort in place function would have to take a pointer argument, as it can't possibly recieve the unsorted array otherwise without it being a global variable. It should have a signature like `int sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` if you want to return a value indicating success/failure/already sorted or `void sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` to simply perform the sorting. You'd then call it like so: `sort_values(array, size);` after collecting input.",

I think in a way it's seen as a strategy to make employees think more that's it's an industry problem rather than their company's problem.",

Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.Why the \"layoff\"? - to improve the Q3 numbers. The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated. Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.It got so bad that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.The whole place just sucks. Everyone is now only about making their numbers. No help. No camaraderie. No extra anything. It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it. You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.Senior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping. Guru guy quietly says that management can't be trusted and will probably lay off again the when the Q1 slack hits. He thinks it will probably be him as he still makes more than most. But nobody knows.No one raises any issues at meeting. The life has drained out of the place. It was a fun an exciting job. The call will come just before your shift starts.Management lies at every call. They talk about the heavy forecast and how much work is coming. - Exactly like they were before the layoffs. They are probably just saying it to convince the people above them. Its such an obvious act now that you know to look for it.Keep your head down. Shut up, do you work. Spend your free time studying and looking for a better job. Don't make any large purchases and save every penny. Canned?

Also, our relatively safe situation made it easy for us to call our employers on their bullshit (see various protests about tech being sold to what some consider \"bad\" regimes, etc)When a company makes money, it gets shared between labor and capital. Capital wants an ever growing slice of the pie. That means cutting the portion that goes to workers, and layoffs lower salary/raise expectations. And when people fear for their jobs, they're less likely to make noise about the company 's ethics.Capitalism needs a \"reserve army\" (that's not from me, the jolly bearded man who loved the color red coined the term), an underclass of desperate people, to keep salaries low and control workers via the threat of unemployment. There wasn't really one in this business. They're creating it.",

If they traumatize software engineers enough, more will be willing to work for less money, under worse working conditions, for longer hours, and be thankful for it for fear they lose their job and can't find another. The more software engineers who feel this way even after the market recovers, the longer they can underpay and abuse us. And they get a huge stock bump and large bonuses for announcing layoffs, so for them it's win-win.",

Also this isn't 30K engineers. We're talking TPMs, Design, Marketing, Growth, Analysts, Software Engineering, Hardware Engineering, Recruiting, HR, QA etc etc etc. A quick google shows that Amazon has 350K corporate employees in Seattle and Bellevue alone.Once you slice that 30K across all those job roles, across every country Amazon is in, the impact is practically zip. They're probably cancelling dozens of go nowhere projects and the staff along with it. In companies this large, there are probably 3 complete organizations of hundreds of staff all working on basically the exact same feature/product.There's no conspiracy here. Amazon can easily cut 30K, pump the stock price and make investors happy. That's it - that's all. There's no fuckin psyop here. The waste, redundancy, bureaucracy, politics that occurs in companies this big is insane. The something something AI stuff is just, again, mostly for wallstreet.There are projects that companies like this that have 300+ staff that end up going nowhere after investing 2-4 years in it and then are just totally shit canned and we never hear about them.",

People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.The reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.Going forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.With that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for. Any body that's spent their career trying to be high-impact/goal-oriented and developed a reputation and resume to match isn't struggling nearly as much right now.",

        "body": "I think I can speak to this. Basically the path isn’t a clear career plan. When I was fresh out of college with a CS degree (sort of many moons ago) it’s been a decade for me. I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. Sorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path.",

It’s not just AI or layoffs, the market is flooded with graduates while global uncertainty keeps shaking investments. Still, there’s work out there, just more fragmented across projects and smaller companies. Many have found unexpected roles. One friend in Germany started education consulting after a casual meeting and has been working remotely for six years. Another with a sociology degree became an accountant for a firm hiring across Canada, France, and Turkey. Not all paths are straight lines.To stay adaptable, it helps to build flexible income streams. Creating profiles on Fiverr or Upwork, keeping resumes [ATS-friendly](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumereview/comments/1jsb9a8/4_steps_to_creating_a_jobwinning_resume_resume/), and applying through sites like [hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.Cafe) that pull listings from company pages can make a difference. Following the [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) who contacted recruiter firms on Google Maps is another option. Some applications won’t lead anywhere at first, but eventually, there will be a response from somewhere. The market feels unpredictable, yet people are still finding their way.",

If you are getting far in the process but not an offers, your performance could be quite good, but there just are other very competitive candidates. If you aren’t able to get by the first few interviews, finding someone to do some mock interviews with you might help you get some useful feedback.Remember to get enough rest.

To me anytime someone from a non FAANG company asks a leetcode question I just know they put 0 thought into their hiring process and probably have a revolving door of engineers. FAANG does it because they have 10s of thousands of applicants and teams etc. You are just copying them when you only have one product, you are not the same.Its like you said companies that don't ask leetcode or are smaller tend to pay less but they still pay well. I know tons of engineers clearing 180-200k working at companies you have never even heard of.",

Pay is shitty but would you personally take a job with shitty pay for swe?I was at a private non-tech company in a non-tech city working on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for 15 years It was my first job at out school in 2006 and I made 42.5K. At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.People will ask, why didn't you leave? The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking. The problem was my experiences didn't match the YOE or title at other companies.At the end of the day I was working at a non-tech company, their goal was pumping out features and meeting the bare minimum of FDA guidelines, not creating quality code. Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.I even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly. When management found out they literally told me \"if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all.\" The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.They were content with the speed of development, which was slow. They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process. They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.At the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained. I'm not saying ever place is like this, but that has been my experience which really soured me on working at companies like this. Sadly I'm not smart enough to get in to real tech companies, so I just have to deal with what I can get.",

I had a friend who worked as a pharmacist for 15 years as their main pharmacist. One day he showed up to work and there was a sign that the company had been sold and they were liquidating. Basically, what I'm saying is, don't look for the job that will make you feel comfy and safe, have good financial habits. Have a plan for if you do lose your job. Have savings. Have investments. Keep your eye open for opportunities, don't burn bridges, connect with people, etc.I'm not secure at Meta in the fact that I'm layoff proof, because I'm not, I'm secure at Meta because I'm confident in the network I've built, the skills I've learned, and that I have potentially years of runway to cover my bills, and that's without reducing my spend which if I was unemployed for a while I absolutely would tighten up the belt.",

Within a year of working as an SWE I was pretty much sure I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I hate the idea of the career and just focus on skills I can learn on the job and off. If I get laid off again, that's freeing tbh. Because then I can explore something else and it's not at the expense of me being worried I quit my job, I got let go. But that's also because I have no debt and a healthy safety fund. I've also interviewed for jobs that weren't even swe jobs but the domain knowledge from my swe gigs was very valuable to them. So become interdisciplinary early on or seriously make sure you understand whatever field you're in bc a liaison between tech and something else is invaluable.",

        "body": "I have some weird semi-related experiences to this actually.At one of my jobs, we hired a new grad who had launched a very successful app in their home country. It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of \"look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.\"In short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",

(Yes I know that's what NDAs are for, but I've meet some really paranoid people in this industry). If I were you I'd try to downplay how many paying customers you've got (congrats on that btw, it takes a lot of work to get anyone willing to pay for an app and that number is not insignificant), and focus more on your technical abilities.Good luck on the job hunt, from the sounds of things you'd be a great asset for any company to bring on, and hopefully one of them will realise this.",

The question I am going to poke at is how well will you work on a team. What are some bad habits I am going to have to worry about? I am going to poke to see how arrogent you are, This followed up by how well do you take being wrong or pushed back on. Also see how well you will take being assigned grunt work. They are general items I always poke at but I poke a little harder on people who have their own apps as juniors as they tend to react more negatively to them and more concern about them effecting the team negatively more.

An executive's job is to run a section of the business, make it work well, and be accountable to its results.An executive's job security is based on how important their piece of the business is, how hard/risky it is to remove them from that piece of the business (either to replace them or reorg the function away), and how politically influential the person is (like who else will leave or become a problem if I fire this person). If your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security. The title means nothing. It's just about what power you have. Generally, the title of an executive is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. You are VP of eng because you are the person controlling eng. You aren't controlling eng because you are VP of eng. Where these are misaligned, the person with the title needs to be pushed out and replaced with who's actually in charge, and will be in any functional org. But who is actually controlling critical pieces of of the business is very safe.",

Extremely senior roles actually have less equitable job prospects in the open market at any given point in time, and as a result most businesses will \"sideline you\" while you figure out your next move. Senior SWE? You can get interviews tomorrow for that. VP of software engineering? Takes time to connect to your network, make a role for you, or work into an existing hiring process. What it also may look like in a mass-layoff type scenario is that you need to layoff a significant amount of your team, then you \"get fired\". You would be critical in rebalancing the existing work on the new owners but consolidation may drive your role to be redundant anyway. You can't justify the scope of work or w/e.",

Those who aren't are asked to go back to IC. That also meant that directors with limited spans were asked to take on more areas, but I didn't see any directors laid off.I think layoff risk decreases higher up you go, but firing risk increases. As a manager or director, you're responsible for certain OKRs and project deliveries. It's inevitable that there will be some bad projects out there, either in tech talent of the team, bad product vision, or operational politics, only some of which the manager can control. The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.It's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially. At a certain level, you can negotiate your own exit package that is nonstandard. So, I think there's some second thought that always goes into laying off at higher levels because of that.",

I mean, I totally understand what you're saying, but what you say to them sounds dismissive of the teams time, because they don't leave early, and it's scheduled on your calendar. You essentially just told them, \"I can leave when I feel like it.\"Think about the context - 'how would you handle situations where people argue'I think they want to hear about a situation where you actually handled it, because that's the person that they want to hire - someone who was able to manage the situationSo, if anything, now that you know that question can (and probably will) come up in a future interview, i'd prob be prepared with a diff story. If that's just what you do normally and don't really have a story that applies, then that's just how it is, should you make something up?Now that I think of it, a similar question that i've been asked is like, 'how do u handle a difficult coworker, or disagreement with a coworker'. Fortunately, in my career, those moments are few and far between. And that's what I express - but i still have to come up with something, i just have to tap into some really really old examples. My response is usually \"you know, i've actually been fortunate enough to work with engineers that collaborate very well together and so i can't tell you a definitive situation recently where our disagreement on xyz was so strong.\" And so i give maybe an old story and how i generally work it out, and really if things escalate to where it gets out of hand, that's what our manager is there for.",

I had AI create me a working table with sorting rows, then I messed up the sorting with some bugs and other stuff going on. The test is to fix the sorting. I broke it by violating some pretty basic React rules, so if you know React you should be able to fix it.For the backend I chose a hackerrank test from the list of available tests. Mostly everyone who has taken it has at least done decently.Only a few people have taken it so far, so I’m really only getting initial data here. About 1/3 of the people have been able to fix the sorting in React. It’s only two files, it’s a fairly small code snippet, and you have about an hour to do the test.The interesting thing is the backend test I chose from hackerrank. It’s a beginner level question, our project is pretty frontend heavy and we are moving a lot of logic to the backend. We need someone strong in frontend who is at least somewhat competent on backend.Since it is an easy question, it tells you to create a class, what to name the methods, and what they need to accept as arguments… then it flags everyone’s answers as plagiarism because they are all exactly the same.",

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week. Being a good communicator is critical here (as in many big techs).PIPs do happen but you should give yourself some credit - passing the interviews and getting an offer is not trivial and it means that you have a good shot at succeeding.It opens doors for you career-wise in tangible ways (learning new skills) and intangible ways (brand recogniziton, relocation opportunities to the US, that kind of thing). Depending on your goals and lifestyle values you might find that it's a smart move. Good luck!",

I barely write any code, the occasional automation, but it’s mostly yaml config type stuff. Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school. As others have said, it’s something people usually choose to get into later in their career, it assumes a lot of underlying knowledge, it’s high stakes, and it’s not the type of work everybody enjoys or excels at. I know the job market is hard and you take what you can get, but I’d definitely try to get on a different team, or take the job and immediately continue looking for something new before you get pigeon holed. Don’t let what happened to me happen to you.",

The companies in the earlier rounds were an absolute goldmine for learning opportunities. At smaller startups, you typically have to wear many hats, if you can’t do a little bit of everything and be flexible in your work then you’re not as valuable. They’re also a fun, exciting, and different work environment than large companies. There are a lot of desirable reasons to work at a startup. I’ve also worked at large companies (30,000+ employees) and my experiences there were largely terrible in comparison to the startup life. I always really enjoy going into work at startups, you make really close connections and you build cool stuff. It’s very fulfilling and rewarding and you don’t feel like a cog in the machine. That being said, I’ve been laid off twice due to companies going under. There are many reasons to join a startup - stability is not one of them. Just my 2c.",

My mother used to go into work at 6 AM so she could leave the office in time to pick us up from school. My dad worked from home so that he could be there in the morning to get us ready and drop us off. Both compromised significantly - both by declining promotions, and by staying with companies that afforded them more flexibility over those that paid better. They turned down Google offers because it was known for being a very hard place to work at the time, so it's kind of funny that FAANG is seen as kind of a golden ticket these days.So long and short is that you will have to compromise - either in terms of career progression or not being with your kids - if you feel you're hitting your limit. You have to decide whether growing your family or your career is more important.",

Normal 40hr weeks, use the crap out of unlimited PTO, etc. I can drop off/pick up kids at school on WFH days, take them swimming, volleyball games, etc. Got a promo anyways, and now make very good money. I've been in big tech for just over 8 years now. My wife quit her job to be a SAHM. I don't technically need to work either, but I like the work.",

The experience you are describing really falls into the “builder cto” role… have you considered an early stage startup? It’ll get you closer to the code again and there is no shortage of folks that have taken or are about to take seed funding looking for someone who has been there before in terms of build. Might want to spend an hour or two a night getting ramped up on running LLMs locally and MCP/RAG for the agentic stuff as that’s where all the funding is right now, and you already have solid domain/industry experience. I know downskilling sounds like an attractive option but sometimes you just gotta put ten toes down and stand on business. There are plenty of hands on CTO roles out there looking for real experience right now. I’m not saying don’t try for the SDE roles but just pointing out there is a path where you can both get more hands on and keep a path in the csuite. Check out stuff like execthread and wellfound, and just know that recruiting for this stuff doesn’t happen on the normal channels so try to figure out what’s the best path in your ideal industry and what’s available around your local market as well. I’m confident you’d get picked up with the little you’ve shared you just gotta find a way into the bloodstream.",

Imagine wanting to mobile/backend/frontend and you get stuck in security or data engineering for rotation. This system does has its perks that you can escape a bad fit the second rotation, and you get to try new things. But internally? There’s a lot of teams who hate TDP/Coda hires because they are basically assigned one and they can be a net negative. That attitude is awful in a pip culture because everyone already wants to save themselves and claim as much visibility as possible (first person to turn in performance reviews can claim milestones and others then have to go to extra efforts disprove them). Imagine being a senior engineer and you want to help the junior get up to speed but if you do, you likely going to get pipped for not delivering more of your own tasks. Years ago, they apparently counted mentoring, interviewing, and similar activities as a bonus point towards performance and now it’s almost a negative. Yes, yes. If you don’t end up in Card/similar, and get placed in Cloud in C1 you can barely do any work and not get pipped compared more competitive orgs (I know someone in cloud who admitted that they should get pipped but their manager is too lazy and finds it easier to just lie about their performance and cloud is less aggressive on pip).

Some would say I'm fear mongering but they already got rid of (or are in the process of getting rid of) the CODA program and the way the industry is headed you really need to be prepared for the worst",

Aside from that based on your resume I'm assuming you are targeting web dev positions in which case I think you'd need to up-skill a little bit more. So doing projects that involve cloud infra or general dev op CI/CD pipeline I think would be really helpful. For example if a job posting goes up and outside of the basic \"must know javascript/react bla bla\" theres probably also going to be a line or two somewhere about knowing something in cloud like AWS Lambda and knowing some infrastructure stuff. Even for the \"SWE I\" roles. If a recruiter sees your resume and cant instantly draw that link for AWS Lambda for example they are likely to scrap it. Its annoying but that how it is with cold applying right now.You also have your degree in computer engineering, im curious to what job positions you are actually applying to. You should still qualify for early career new grad stuff along with internships which sounds like you are also applying to but have you tried stuff out side of the web dev space? Like embedded stuff/robotics etc? Heck honestly you could probably read a C/C++ book and open up a whole new world for yourself.",

Like theres realistically only so many of those that can be put out before people (initial recruiters) start catching on to that kind of fluff. That said participate in hackathons. If you cant or are not willing do that pick a few companies and roles that you'd like to target. Read the job description and find out exactly what they are asking for. build a project or contribute to an open source project that is based around that jobs needs. For example if you are applying to netflix streaming, it might be useful to either contribute to ffmpeg or build a quick wrapper application around ffmpeg. If a company is looking for someone to help with their AI/ML stuff it would probably be useful to make an AI agent.Most of the jobs/recruiters are just matching keywords and things that align with their goal. Your projects dont have to have major impact or be meaningful. They should just demonstrate that you used and have somewhat of an understanding of the technologies that the company is going to want you to use and implement.",

At slower and bigger companies breadth isn't too valuable because they probably have experts in each domain who they'd prefer to leverage to do things more optimally. Also when it comes to landing interviews for all types of jobs to begin with, it's usually easier if you send strong signals that you're an expert in the tech stack that they'll have you work in as your main responsibility. The reason is, an expert won't have to catch up to speed and will be able to contribute at a deeper level (they know valuable stack-specific best practices and optimizations).EDIT: One hiring advantage you can leverage if you are a generalist is that you can probably build cool projects all by yourself to show off on your resume.",

It doesn't matter if you're the world's leading expert on some 10-year-old technology if it's obsolete.Conversely, being a hyper-generalist leads nowhere because employers want a person with depth in *something.* Nobody wants to hire a person who'd mediocre at everything.Personally, I aim to be a T-shaped engineer.

The only sustainable move for specialists to make is to get into leadership. Preferably as quickly as possible because the bottom can and will fall out. See the current status of Salesforce development for example.Contrast that to a generalist who gets paid less to start, but eventually they know so much there isn't really anything they can't do. Once you're 15 to 20 years deep studying become unnecessary because you have a total grasp on how everything works within the current architectural limits of computing. You can literally do just about anything at a high-level and weigh every pro and con from a technical perspective without needing to research anything. They're far more likely to retain their roles when the bean counters in finance are looking to make cuts.",

Specialization can be added on top to fit into desirable roles after.The problem I see with a lot of specialist engineers, even mid-to-late career, is that they can end up being sidelined when things go wrong.Like a superstar front-end engineer who can crush React components, handle bundling and build systems and even has solid chops putting together a build system and deployment pipeline. But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.Specialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they \"own\" but fall outside their speciality.I'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other \"IT\" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.So ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos. I think that means you pretty much need to be a generalist early in the career, then evolving specialist knowledge in one or more domains as your experience grows.",

In the USA going home for lunch break is uncommon, nobody wants to stayt at work longer than they have to so most just eat at their desk and work and just do their 8 hours. Bosses will not be on your ass about that unless upper management says something. Especially in the jobs with bad work culture there is a lot of \"we dont expect you to work more than 40 hours \\*wink-wink\\*\" or other statements like that. The problem is when one person starts working over 40, gets the praises and the more people do it. When one person doesnt want to do it, they get questions like \"well why are you so behind you co-workers?\". Even if you complete the work required in 40 hours, tehy will compare you to your co-workers not was is expected of you.

Ingest the data and get the report could be step one. Step two find the problem and FIX it. Step three maybe do a thorough investigation to see if other data is being missed. Step four have a test suite or some way to monitor so this scenario doesn’t happen again. If the urgent steps are not completed by noon on X day - you’re going to contact the manager or team lead and bring in help. You’re also actively communicating the status of these issues during standup / keeping your manager updated. Also - if you know you’re doing dumb stuff then you need to stop and take a step back.

Base salary increase is nice, but make sure there are stock options available for you at the new place because that is your incentive to make the place a success.Bottom line, the major advantage of an established company over a startup is that established companies can offer more stability (less likely to miss payroll, less likely to close up shop entirely, etc). If you already don't feel secure because of a cutthroat pip culture where you aren't learning anything, then that erodes the major advantage. Good luck with the new job.",

So, if you want to know the reality - get your hands dirty. Be real. Figure it out - and stop listening to the hordes of people generalizing everything.

I'm not sure why people think software engineering would be any different.>I just want to understand the reality of things before I startHere's my free advice for you: start teaching yourself how to code first. Do it as much as you can. See if you like it. If you think it's cool and you enjoy it (despite it being confusing and difficult at first), then enroll in some CS courses and see if you like the coursework. If you do, then jump into a full-time CS degree program, and try to do at least one internship while you're enrolled. Once you graduate, based on how well you did in school and the quality of your resume, you just might end up with a job after graduation.On the other hand, if the *only* thing drawing you to this field is the potential payday, then things might not look as good for you. The sheer competitiveness means people who enjoy this stuff are going to have a leg up since they're more likely to excel and stand out.",

If you are pressed odds are they are even more pressed. \\- Show your work, this is key. WHen you finish a task, ask for 10 minutes post stand up and show a video or show your work.

He probably solved that problem countless of times before so it's straightforward to him. If he has been working for the company a long time, he is also much more comfortable with the codebase than you, naturally. You will get there eventually, don't stress out about it.I don't think you should log in during your PTO or work every weekend. That's a sure way to burn out, and your performance and focus will get even worse. Do other things, have fun, refresh, have hobbies.Also, maybe the stories that you get assigned are hard for your current level. A lot of companies don't even want junior developers, and don't know the appropriate level of tasks that they should give them.If you are always given tasks above your level, then you will always feel like you are not enough. It's all relative.My only advice would be to ask more questions and ask for help earlier in the task and not wait until the end. If you are unsure about how to do something, ask for advice or \"how to do it well\" or \"the best practices\" for such task. When you want to discuss your task with your senior, study your task very well, understand the code you wrote, and **TAKE NOTES**. Don't try to remember everything in your head if you can't. I always brought my notebook during meetings when I had to talk about my tasks and code and referred to it when needed.Good luck",

I could not get anything done on time. All of my PRs would get torn to pieces in review. I caused a handful of significant issues in prod. I spent every single day worrying about getting fired. A few of my more complicated projects brought me to tears.Everyone I work with has like 7+ years of experience. I feel like a fucking worm compared to my teammates. Just like you said, they can do in an hour what I can't do in five. I can't even comprehend how people can work at that speed.Here's where our stories diverge, though:My manager has consistently (like at least once a month) reminded me that I am doing an awesome job. They have reminded me that it's normal for me to be slower than my teammates, it's normal for me to struggle or have knowledge gaps, and it's normal for me to ask for help. My work is valued by the company even if it isn't as impressive as the work being done by industry veteran wizards.>“I don’t even know how to help you.”That's your \"Team Lead\"? Their job is literally to know how to lead you. They are admitting that they are bad at their job. This is like the absolute worst thing you could say to a junior 6 months into their first dev role.You should not take what this person said to heart. Maybe you *do* suck at the tasks you're being assigned, but that might just mean your lead sucks at assigning you appropriate tasks.It doesn't sound like you're incompetent, but it also doesn't sound like you have imposter syndrome. It just sounds like you have a shitty boss that isn't facilitating or recognizing your growth.I would just keep your head down, do your work, and shrug off the shitty attitude from your boss. This early on, you should just take things one day at a time. Rack up a couple years of experience and then start exploring better opportunities.",

When new roles are available they make that list available to all those agencies. At that point its a scramble to contact anyone who fits the JD. So if its a recruiter that's been in the game for a while, they have a bunch of candidates they've contacted before, or they already know where to lookIf its someone who sounds a bit new, they send that initial contact msg and if you aren't responsive thats when they keep pressingSo not sure if you've noticed but sometimes you'll get hit up by different agencies where the JD is eerily similar if not identical minus the usual text replacements. It's because it is in fact, the same role for the same companyIn either case, if you don't get any response, some other candidate likely already bit, and they've submitted them for the role (obvi they can submit multiple candidates) but you can see that you've got a better chance the sooner you respond to their initial contact. Maybe you did, but maybe there were also 10 others and they chose to go with candidates that gave them (the recruiter) better chances for selectionI've mentioned this several times before with regards to recruiters - we're just race horses. If you show promise, they give you all the attention, because they're betting all their money that you get selected for the interview process and hopefully all the way to an offer.If you're behind, or lacking, that's when you get ghosted. They might even come back to you when a different role becomes available, because they remembered you replied the last time. You just gotta be quick, and cross your fingers",

In that entire time, they never committed to someone taking responsibility for solving a problem. They seemed to think that generating commentary was the objective in itself, rather than someone taking responsibility for solving a problem.Just to illustrate the ridiculousness of this - there was one instance where a level 6 proposed a design, level 6s reviewed and approved and delivered the design, and then I talked to them 2 times about how the delivered solution did not address the problem that it needed to be used for. And then I was assigned to use their solution, their un-modified solution failed to actually solve the problem I needed it to solve, and I did my best to deliver my part of the project and then resigned in contempt for the leadership of my team. And in my engienering handoff meeting, as I was resigning, after my project had been impacted by this deficit in their design, I mentioned again that it was not fit for the purpose it needed to be used for. One of the level 6 reviewers just said \"This was not identified as a requirement.\" And that was it. Life goes on, they just didn't have to take any responsibility for failing to deliver something which solved a problem and engaging in denialism for months.Anyway, I suggest you ask these people plainly if their commentary is contributing to someone taking responsibility for solving a problem, or if they are generating commentary for some other objective, and figure out whether their commentary is making measurable progress toward that objective. They will probably say that they are trying to contribute valuable implementation details on *how* to solve the problem, so you should be ready to ask if they are sure that their comments are commensurate with the prioritization of problems that we have; because it might be that commissioning a smaller group to solve the problem is a lot more effective than sitting as a group talking about details that are germane only to a subset of people.",

Jusk for clarification, if your colleagues aren't dickheads, then they will be fine with a non-native speaker asking for clarification, do that enough and hopefully they learn to be more concise too.Also some people also just love to hear themselves talk, also some people have work as their whole identity so you may be some of the most exciting social interaction these people get all week.",

Also, there's got to be a lot of old code floating around that needs to be maintained. I'm not looking to lead some giant new project. I just want to keep busy and bring in a bit of income to pad my retirement.",

If so, I assure you that that is not the case; I continue to work 50 or 55 hours a week. The amount of work I do is most definitely not 'ramping down'. However the nature of the work has changed slightly over the years as the product which comprises my primary responsibility has matured. There is less writing features from scratch and more time spent on calls with customers and upper management.",
