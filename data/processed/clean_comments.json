Most posts in this sub are slanted toward the US market, which is extremely tough for those just starting out. Those at the senior level, like many of us here, will not have any issue finding work - networking alone being a game changer. Then there is the issue of soft skills versus technical skills. The longer you have been in the workforce, the more likely you are to have honed the soft skills needed for interviews. There are many relatively new DE's that are technically proficient but, due to a host of reasons (don't get me started), do not have the skills to interview well. I've also decided to ignore my impulse to see everything as LLM-generated. I've personally written a few work proposals where I've been accused of such (no silly graphics or bullet points btw), and those that use LLMs are the first to assume everything written now is the same. I also have family where English isn't their primary language, so it can often be used for translation, and the user is left with terrible formatting.",

I have taken raw, messy streaming data and spoon fed these analysts with a clean model that all they have to do is write a couple joins and, like a few aggregates. 700+ storefront sites each tracking dozens of evens, to external schema, to redshift, moving through multiple transformation schemas. I left them, with a single query for their dashboard. And yet they struggle to do this and need my assistance. Fine, happy to help, but like, comparatively this is a joke. I think I wouldn’t mind this so much if I knew that I was paid significantly more than them, but it’s the opposite. I found out a while back that the analyst working on this project makes just about the same that I do. So my question is, do you ever feel under-appreciated and how do you deal with that? How would you suggest I bring up my concerns of imbalance with my manager?",

Anyone who have used spark knows that Spark has mediocre performance, but it is pretty robust and easy to scale.I think it would be interesting if you can try to make commit to duckdb or clickhouse and see if you can improve their implementation.",

DuckDB is far more advanced than just an implementation - handling data types, optimize query plan, and it needs to consider other things like scalability and generalization for other cases. So of course it's understandable to have worst performance than this implementation.If to compare the performance, I would suggest comparing to solutions like 1 Bil rows challenge solution.Dont get me wrong.

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.And if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.If the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.Super cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

It's just that the word junior isn't in your job title.In both, junior specific roles, as in, have junior in the title, are rare.I'm of the opinion the secret sauce is to teach yourself a little bit and go for mid level roles. There's a lot less competition because the vast majority of people are looking to be taught by more experienced people rather than teaching yourself on the job.

There aren't really junior DE roles. The typical path, and what you've identified, would be to work as an analyst or scientist to get exposure to these tools and technologies and then make the move afterwards.One emerging role that presents an excellent path to data engineering is analytics engineering.

At work I, “go to the coal mine, and get my money.” Maybe not the not the most exciting but I got some fun toys, been to a few countries and switched jobs enough to make $$$ working from home.",

Doesn't even matter if work is enjoyable or not - even when it's not people get through it because they've got personal fulfillment figured out.A constant need to move to a new job is a symptom, not a conclusion: Even people with ADHD can learn to stick to one job, it just means they learn to treat their work differently or they need different positions/roles/subjects/industries/managers.Don't try to \"think\" your way out of this one, get help to identify what needs are left unfulfilled and get clarity before trying to move in any direction. Otherwise you'll just jump to random directions that might seem exciting at first and eventually burn out again because you haven't figured out the core need that is making you move.Try not to move until you've figured out what's making you move, and how to fulfill it.",

But if you've been there for a while it's just the \"same pipeline template\" or the \"same SQL script\" that gets old and boring. If there was a rewrite of the system to something new, that's interesting because it freshens up what you've been working on. Obviously one way around this is to get a new job, but I feel that sometimes merely introducing something new can make things exciting again. For example, are things written in Pandas? Try Polars. Things like that might help you keep motivation.",

If you've reach a level where you manage to have a good position with 30h a week in an office job with good pay, you are better off than maybe 90% of employees. I am afraid it does not get much better than that with this level of comfort, you may have unrealistic fantasies about other software jobs. There's an angle I have explored sometimes, which is working for an organization that makes you feel better ethically, such as a public service. The problem is that they always have worse working conditions and pay. I don't think a masters is going to help you get a better IT job as opposed to more years of experience, at your level of experience diplomas don't matter that much for recruiters I think. If you do it, do it for your own desire to learn without expecting too much from the career perspective, and try to do it while keeping a job, maybe some company will support it. Finally, as everyone else said, absolutely invest the money, free time and peace of mind your current stable position provides into your personal projects, relatives and hobbies.

        "body": "Although there could be many if we go deep down documentation of both Airflow and Dagster but on top of my head in this context I would say they are 1. Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. Airflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

We had a complaint come from the end users that a certain report was taking too long - a report that was built by the BI developers ages ago to satisfy the requirements when data was minimal. The query for this report was hitting our base tables in the raw layer with multiple joins and full table scans and union alls etc.. it was a mess. When we pointed the report to use our facts, performance improved significantly. The benefit here of course is performance. There are other benefits of using an actual modelled solution in the gold layer - control over all lookups - including, and this is crucial, those lookups that have no documentation and are just part of the hard-coded logic of your company's analysts in their scripts. putting most of your business requirements/KPIs in one model also helps everyone read and understand the tables which should reduce quality issues. Data modelers are not just technically adept - they should understand the business as well, a rare breed and are still needed.",

I’d suggest asking them for some suggestions as to where to start, eg which tools should you ramp up on right away.

I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.The key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:- unit tests- automated linting- manually specify function type signatures where it matters- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.In the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. This was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.But it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference. It implemented those optimizations, made all the tests pass, and the resulting program was an order of magnitude faster.It could easily have taken me a month to do all this by hand.",

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.Alternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.If you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.Regarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twiceWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address.

When I started doing this I was using the Java flavor of it, but there are variations that run on Python and Javascript which I'd probably take a look at if getting into it again today. It's relatively simple to see how you can start pushing around pixels on a screen, and there's some nice libraries that add quality of life / neat features like liquid simulation. It's also completely free AFAIK.Touchdesigner ( [https://derivative.ca/](https://derivative.ca/) ) has a bit of a steeper learning curve, and is typically used to abstract all the manual code stuff from Processing into a node-based editor. It comes installed with Python so you can control everything manually in code if you want, but you'll quickly find a lot of shortcuts that you can do with the nodes that are a lot more performant than doing it with your own code. There's a free version with the main limitation being you your resolution is capped below HD, but in practice that's not a big deal for any given projector / LED wall. With this I've begrudgingly found Youtube tutorials extremely helpful- just search for some cool videos with cool thumbnails and it generally takes about 10 minutes of the designer stepping through through their network for you to have it running locally. good luck & have fun!! eager to see what other people are getting up to in this thread.",

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog. But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts. Something like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics. It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves. They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts. Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".Is Dremio working toward adding that capability as well? That would be interesting.",

Their implementation is targeted more at their LLM offerings than BI, though there are some BI integrations already available.

        "body": ">Am I over-stating my current job title as \"Data Engineer\"?I think there are two viewpoints to this: one says, \"it doesn't matter, it's just a title\" which is very common the US side of the subreddit. The other one says, \"if you have to ask if you are something, then you probably aren't\".As somebody in the UK, I lean towards the latter. I'd regard quite a lot of time spent doing data pipeline work and visualisation work as a company who is save money by having their analysts do DE work, even though they are primarily analysts and not engineers.>Am I stretching too much by applying to Data Engineering roles that list cloud experience as requirements?Maybe. I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff. There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.AWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. >Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.As always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability. You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.Leverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength. When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack). Work how your current skills fit into your objectives. Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

It involves POC work to proof certain hypothesis’s. I would ask myself and the organization - What is the vision and the goal of the architecture activities? Could be reduce cost, performance, scaling, ease of use …But usually it happens to what happened to you - a leader that might not exactly what data architecture is thought or was told that he needs an architect.

We're basically 100% On-Prem right now, and although it has some limitations, it suits our needs.From everything I've seen (and tried so far), it's overkill for us because:* **Infrastructure overhead:** Non-managed Airflow means running scheduler, metadata DB, workers, webserver, etc. That’s a complex Docker setup to maintain for just two people.* **Simple requirements**: Our dependency chains are straightforward, so we don’t benefit from Airflow’s more advanced orchestration features.* **Skill requirement:** You need decent Python coding experience for it to work. That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn’t an easier sell either, because our business won’t see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Here's a benign example: say that a file you're picking up with a bunch of cost columns suddenly has a new column. Lets call it fab_cost. It's a new column, so can you ignore it? Well, what if this is a new cost element that's being carved out of an existing cost element? If you ignore this fab_cost you're ignoring some of your cost - and your totals will no longer be accurate.So, *guessing* about schema evolution is just sloppy work for most production systems. The right answer most of the time is to define a data contract between systems - and validate it.",

I really like DMS -> Kinesis -> Firehose which will stream data to your snowflake table in real time. This requires some DMS settings adjustments but DM and I’d be happy to send. BUT if you have to restrict your Smowflake account to certain IPs then it’s no good because Firehose uses Amazon’s service range of ips which is like over 100 and they rotate and change constantly.So the DMS -> S3 is also solid just read the docs for settings.

It feels to me that doing this would be another temporary solution to a deeper problem (aka, treating oltp as olap - and expecting analytical-type speeds).I worked on a company with more users reading/processing data than what my current company has, and the Snowflake bill was quite modest (around 1,000.00 euro per month). But cost for sure is something I'm concerned and want to have proper guardrails around!",

Once the cubing catches up historically days, you can prolly just accomplish the new daily aggregates with a GROUP BY and a filter on the specific day.You could leave them there in a data lake table and continue to query them with Trino or yes, you could push them to an operational RDBMS that can get pretty darn fast, too.If you'd like for some help spit-ball'ing an example or two, add something to my (i.e. disclaimer: I'm a Trino dev advocate @ Starburst) 'forums' site at [https://www.starburst.io/community/forum/](https://www.starburst.io/community/forum/) and we'll make sure we leave some answers for the next person who might want to do something similar).

Sit with a knowledgeable (power-)user of the system while they're working their work, ask questions, take screenshots, names of fields, quirks of the system etc. Then try to map this to tables/fields in database.* Source database query logs (depends on the data and compliance with regulations though): that way you can see what goes together, which tables are queried in the same calls etc.* Indexing: where are the indexes and how are they defined? Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution. Having at least a loose idea of how these strata are working can also give clues (if that reminds you of archeology that's normal, I have worked in an adjacent field before data).* Ancillary data: data like creation timestamp, creation user, logging related ids etc... Are usually added at the end of the table when creating it the first time. Since columns usually keep their sequential order over the lifetime of the database, you can sometimes use these to assess what was part of the original table DDL statement, and what was added after...* Take notes of everything. Save queries, ids, sessions, hypotheses, document it all so no one else has to do that work again afterwards.But yeah. This is difficult, time consuming and hard work. Good luck.",

Relying only on roles inside each query engine tends to fragment governance and forces you to duplicate logic.One alternative is to push governance down to the catalog layer.

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the \"best\" or \"most efficient\" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it. That week becomes a month.Most efficient method is to start with something and build from there.> Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insightsBy all means, take an introductory course into DE. I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful. That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.A lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I got my first DE job\". Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job. For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.The process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy. It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure. It's not to say that you can't do it. In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can. Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead. >Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?I will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head. Just go for mid. The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago. The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market. Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated. One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.Forget junior level positions. Aim for mid level positions. Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced. Be good at communicating. Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things. If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

DataTalks DE Zoomcamp walks you through that for free; Zero-to-Mastery covers similar ground but spends more time on theory, so combine it with hands-on practice or you will feel lost in interviews. I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code. Document everything in a GitHub repo, add a CI pipeline that reruns daily, and mention the link on your resume; recruiters love evidence over certificates.

For auth, traefik provides middleware that you can configure to check credentials with another service (Oauth2proxy is a popular one) or basic auth if you’re retroIf you need to control traffic within a k8s cluster (traefik is mainly used as a ingress controller for out of cluster load balancing) you probably want a service mesh like [istio](https://istio.io/). They can be kind of a pain to configure and administer, but it gives you pretty powerful control over network traffic",

This is a mix of type 2, where each new version gets a new id, and type 1, so your fact table might have a “UserId” which is the id of the user to a single type 2 record, and a “Current User Id” - which may be the user id from the source system where IsCurrent = True in your dimension table.I recommend only using type 2 on columns you definitely want new records when it changes, but sometimes you get asked for a column in hindsight. You can either risk it, make a new record on a wider range, or all, columns, or keep the audit table of all changes just in case you need to rebuild it.",

With duplication of data, you can schedule the workload, with federation, it is difficult to control it.",

In lean times, keeping your job is the reward.If you want to make even more money in bad times, your relatively accessible options are: holding your company hostage (e.g. the only person who can do X, which is mission-critical), changing company, taking a role with way more responsibilities for far less pay than the person they just fired who was doing that job, doing something else on the side, or finding a way to profit from things getting worse. > Everyone seems to be hanging and doing nothing.That's because everyone else has figured this out already, probably because this is not their first downturn.

When using `:memory:`, you won't have any persistence.DuckDB by itself, even outside of dagster, handles its own multiprocessing. As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.To bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.Multiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.If you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (without being willing to persist your data to disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB. DuckDB is intentionally not built to support multi-writer setups: https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/connect/concurrency.html#writing-to-duckdb-from-multiple-processes",

That's not how databases are supposed to work.What you want is to have a single database with as many tables as you need to hold your data, and then parse all of the XML files - with Python, say - and write the contents of each one as rows of data to the required tables through one or more database connections. XML parsing is quick. Writing to rows to a database through an open connection is also quick. Creating databases is slow. Restructure your script to do things this way and performance should increase by orders of magnitude. Then - if you're still not happy with performance - you can look into parallelizing reads and writes. May well not be necessary though. Serially parsing a few million XML files is something that should easily be doable in under 5 minutes, unless each one is 10MB or something.",

Unlike traditional colleges, WGU doesn't use the \"à la carte\" model for their degree programs, where students can choose elective courses within their major and pay for additional courses outside of their major. WGU's model is more like a \"prix fixe\" menu - students pay a fixed price per term, and take courses from a set menu, with no electives or non-major courses. I have thought of taking one of the degree programs (BSDA or BSCNE) and studying the most high-value parts of the other program separately. For example, complete the BSDA, then study for and take the Network+, Security+, and Azure certifications separately.",

For example `raw/customer/25/08/01/customer.json.gz`. That way if I ever need to reprocess it’s easy to do so based of dates.For batch processing where you are only consuming the files periodically, I find it easier to have some type of ops or metadata file processing table, which keeps track of which files have already been processed.

And there is no correlation with gender, former education, grades, IQ, nerdiness or all the other factors that people like to count. The only thing I have seen that they all have in common is curiosity, willingness to fail (not fail a course, but like falling of a bicycle, or missing a dance-step and getting up and try again), and a bit of a stubbornness, in that they *want* to fix the problem they currently have!Those I seen fail are mostly those who give up waaay too soon, or those who doesn't care about making something by themselves, but just want a finished result, so they can get on with other things. Like they have no pride in their work, they just want to be done.So those are the traits I see: **curiosity**, **courage**, **stubbornness**, willingness to try again and again and again, accepting even the smallest progress as a win!",

C-lang by 95. Html, while not a language a couple years later with css Java and Javascript. Some xml later and c++. Little later, obj-c, this was all prior to 2011 when I grew to hate it all.Guitar. Started in the summer of 88. Piano not long after that. Drums in the early 2000s. It's still my favorite instrument. Can do a bass but never had the finger strength. Spent many years off and on teaching music.1st time at college in fall 96 started algebra 1 and 2, then moved up to trigonometry and geometry. Never got to Calc summer of 98 and beyond was bad for many years. Still absolutely adore physics and cosmology. On regret is never picking up chemistryLinguistics major now focusing on teaching english as a 2nd language or foreign language. Started Spanish in 2004 in Atlanta while working tree service Picked up Chinese in the fall and spring semester last yearThe summer project was revamped for the entire 2018 cryengine for kingdom come deliverance. Ripped out all inverse kinetics animation bullshit. Reverse engineered the entire crisis 2 physics systems with ragdolls, recoil, and hut reactions. Warhorse had ripped out a good 97 to 98% of the system. That is all xml and lua tagged into a full c++ engine. Near total overhaul. Nothing like the original game.I also enjoy modding other games on the nexus. Full overhauls for several games now and a couple more deleted. Some of my hardest programming challenges I have solved in my brain whole I sleep. Can literally see the code roll past, and when I get up in the morning shit gets to work pretty quick.After a while, you start to think in other languagesI have had this happen with music, programming, and Chinese It is awesome Still can't get hired in the gaming industry. Tried for more than 20 years. I ran a mud for 15 years. Rewrote the entire thing. Went from 90kb to 8mb to 6mb depending on what year it was. Had hard-core. Skill based with 20 classes in by 2000. ended with a full random equipment generator and 1000+ skills spells and abilities and a full in game quest and quest reward system by 2003. Oh, and a planet and elemental system. And a complete random event system by 2005But ya know to this day, because I don't have a degree I don't have any experience getting into the industry . I pretty much have a doctorate in game design. Always the same e. Don't call us we will call youYes, it rewires your brain, and it is glorious And so many people will never understand that",

Language, art, music, and cultural identity never really interested me bc it felt very fluid and ever morphing with very grey lines. So coding was always likely a very natural path for me. But I would say ive had a different outcome in life. Instead of coding/programming as a job it'd been more of a passive hobby for me. Ive gotten exceptionally good at understanding underlying factors and influences that have shaped modern cultures, music, language etc. To the point that writing and expressing my thoughts is likely one of my strongest traits. But I think learning how to program ironically really helped with it. Objective oriented programming really helped shape my understanding of repeated actions creating ever growing outcome (loops). Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, \" if then\" statements. Oh my god it reshaped basic logic for me and how I view people's actions/decisions/fallacies. It made me infinitely more forgiving and compassionate to strangers and their mistakes. I was able to categorize and recognize thousands of what was just instinctive gut feelings into actual logic and language for me. It gave me a weird algorithmic way to categorize the world for me and ground me in a more \"human\" way. It helps me massively predict the outcomes of actions/consequences and think ahead in a way I hadn't considered before.",

Basically, when you ask a question, you should be at a point where you know the information you are looking for, but also know that you can't find it yourself.So, for example, asking \"how do I commit a change\" is not a good question, because it's vague, would take hours to answer fully and strongly suggests you have not done even basic research.Asking \"What is the URL of the GitHub server\" is a great question - I can answer it instantly, and there is no way you could have found it out yourself (errr - unless it's in the new starter guided in which case you shouldn't have asked it, obviously!).So, when asking a question (or raising a bug, or anything really) always start with \"What I did\", \"What I expected to happen\" and \"What actually happened\" - change those questions to ones that make sense for the question you are asking, but generally they are a good format for asking for help.People want to help - they just don't want to do your job for you.",

And even if they do, try not to stress too much until there’s a PIP.What I would do is when you see someone you’d like to emulate solve a problem quickly, ask if they wouldn’t mind you shadowing them for a bit. Ask them to explain their problem solving and thought process. It’ll be specific to that problem, of course, but over time you’ll start to see the patterns. If you need to get permission to do something like this then ask your team lead for a certain amount of time per week to devote to shadowing and training.",

That “translating a problem into smaller problems” part comes with practice, not just theory.One thing that helped me: don’t jump straight into huge apps. Build small, focused projects where you only practice one concept (e.g., a to-do app for CRUD, a weather app for API calls, a notes app with React state). Once you’ve done a few, you’ll naturally start connecting the dots and see which tool to use where.And don’t feel dumb if a colleague solves things faster, it’s just experience. With time, you’ll recognize patterns and solutions faster too. Keep building, break things down, and your speed/intuition will grow.",

This is both a humbling place to be, but also demonstrates you've got the guts to stick it out in that place. Good for you. Every progammer will feel this at some point, you're joining a long long line of great engineers who've walked this path. Welcome :red_heart:As for breaking a problem down, there's a few ways to do it, as you can imagine. Here's my 2 cents for you:If you can't clearly see a structure for your solution, consider starting with a monolith. You'll build a thing that works (customer says yay) and the natural boundaries/seams will likely reveal themselves in the process. Kent Beck was saying as much the other day on LinkedIn.Whiteboard is king. And bring a friend, use them as a rubber duck. Or use an actual rubber duck.Finally, don't get cute. Most languages have some fancy features you'll be tempted to use. Resist their siren song :grinning_face_with_sweat:These are suggestions. There will be situations in which they represent bad advice. Keep your eyes open.Super lastly - good engineering is, I believe, about human communication. Strive to build good partnerships with other engineers... Then steal all their good ideas and ways of thinking! Haha. In a loving way, of course.Best.",

That feeling of powerlessness is job security my friend so just learn whatever weird things they are doing. I once (thankfully) flunked an interview because they tested me on object oriented Perl because that is how they did things. I found that odd and after the interview requested a sample of what it was they were even alluding to. They could not produce this sample for me needless to say. The questions they presented were the equivalent of doing FP with Ruby or building a compiler with Awk. Sometimes enterprise code winds up that way.

That is kind of the core loop of any engineering work.Express yourself either in pseudocode, or use some features of the programming language that lets you gloss over details while you work out a general structure, like [the `todo!` macro in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html), that always passes typechecking but crashes with a `not yet implemented: your message` if it ever actually gets called.Sometimes you'll find that what you thought was a decent strategy for a solution can't be implemented for whatever reason, then you have to think about that sub-problem again and see if there's some other way to get at it. And preferably leave a comment about the strategy you thought of first and why it's unworkable.> I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more.That helps, but everyone has to start somewhere.

If you ever decide you like where project is & you want people to be able to access it OR you decide you done with a project but you want other people to try to complete it you can then publish it.Another commentor mentioned it not being a resume, but you can turn GitHub into a portfolio. If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).Edit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub. If your computer crashes or your files get corrupted you can retrieve your old code. AND if you break your code some how you can roll back to an older working version. I wish I had been used GitHub when 6 was beginning, I have months/years of code lost. It would be neat to go back to look at.Edit 2: One benefit of make your code public is that is anything happens where you lose access to your GitHub account, you will still be able to download your old code.",

Doing something complex will force you to write shitty code and leave the perfectionism to a future date. And what makes someone a good programmer isn't writing code or building things. Its being able to reason about things. Break things down into manageable components. Id your entire idea is a simple manageable thing theres not much to break down.1. Set up linux on your pc/laptop.2. Set up neovim3. Add plugins to neovim to allow for things like LSP integration, autocomplete, formatting etc.4. Create a tcp server and tcp client in c++. You should be able to establish a connection between the two, enter data in the client, send the data to the server, read the data on the server, write it to standard output,send data back to the client, have the client read it the data and display it.Just 1 and 2 will improve you leaps and bounds.This will genuinely improve you more than you will ever know. You might not even understand any of what I just wrote. But thats the point. Thats the fun. Thats what makes SWEs, SWES. Our ability to break things down into the smallest possible parts, research each part, and come up with some solution, probably a terrible one, and then have the drive/ambition/desire to research/experiment how to improve that code you just wrote, before you ultimately realise you will always need to improve the code. And thats the fun. The best SWEs ive met, dont have 1000 functioning apps that have generated billions of pounds. They've just gone extremely deep into onr specific thing. For me its network, hence why I suggest a tcp server/client. I also think its the best project because thats what I honestly have found separates more advanced devs; the ability to understand things at a fundamental level. When you're coding, you're essentially just reading and writing data. But how is that data read/written? The internet is such a massive change to the course of humanity, yet most devs dont know what a packet is. What a protocol really is. They know how to use ser up a front and backend but not what really is going on. This project will force you to have to learn fundamental things. Theres more fundamental thjngs than this but I think thats a good base to start with. As opposed to literally writing binary.Some might say this is too complex. And it is. But thats the point. Writing a calculator or something doesnt help. You know how a calculator works. All youre really doing then is just typing. Making a website is good, but theres so much involved in that under the hood, it just seems like its jumping the gun. Get the hard project out the way, everything else will be 100x easier.",

But as for my promo, everyone was really sweet and the more skilled didn't hesitate to make rounds to see if anybody needed a helping hand. Anyway, after that first week passed I kinda had a click. While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises I finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...).

I also worked as a “teacher” during other piscines, so I’ve seen both sides.For context: when I started the piscine I had **zero coding knowledge**. I didn’t even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.You’re *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that’s the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.The main things they look at are:* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.It’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.One last tip: **don’t measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn’t mean you’re behind. You’re on your own track.And yes, you’ll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone’s starting point is.

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later onAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! Its very important that you have a good grasp on the “context” of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren’t aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.Last couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? What are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you’re supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?How comfortable are you getting with your current “ignorance” ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? And make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important oneMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb And have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:* start the game * reset score, health and positions* game loop: * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer * move enemies * move player * check collisions * if player hits enemy: inc points * if player-health < 0, exit loop* game over * display score * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the gamesomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.Then when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.This doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!As you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

        "body": "OOP is basically mandatory to write good Java and honestly can help you greatly.The example I like to give is you have to start thinking of your program as different pieces that work together to accomplish a goal. As a piece gets too complex to keep track of, you want to look at good ways to break down what it does. Java sometimes goes too far with this in my opinion but it's a sensible premise to start from.It's fairly similar to how function design should be done. A function should do ideally one thing very well that takes a relatively small number of lines of code (though it might end up doing a couple of things honestly). But in OOP, we want to consider what those functions are usually working with and put all the similar functions into a class.For example, classic ATM design. You could build a deposit(account_no, amount) and withdraw(account_no, amount) function and just tie your UI into them. But note that there are a few complicated bits these functions will need to share. Both will need to access and update the database table for your bank account for example. Both primarily work on your account.So instead of functions, we can build one Account class which takes an account_no as a parameter to the constructor (ie an Account object is representing a specific class in the database) and has methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Since the Account object knows it's account_no already, there's no need to pass it in again. Likewise, imagine we'll have our database with multiple tables that we will need to access. They all share common tasks though like running a Select or an Update query. As we build out our application, we don't want to keep all this logic in every other object we make. So the Database itself can become an object which knows how to talk to the database. Then the Account can build one or be given one to work with.The ultimate goal is that every object knows everything it needs to know to operate and other things have to tell it as little as possible. The Database object doesn't need to know how bank accounts work, and the Account object doesn't need to know how the database work. They just need to know how to use what's called the interface: the way we intend for the object to be used by other objects (these are declared public in Java). This is the principle of cohesive class design - all the similar things are in one class and one class only.The nice part of this is if you swap how the database works, say from MySQL to Oracle, then you just have to redesign your Database object. Your Account object doesnt change at all. This is the idea of loose coupling - your objects rely on the public interface declared, not the internal workings of it.The best way is just to practice. Build object oriented applications and try to keep them cohesive and loosely coupled. You'll get better with practice.",

I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn’t something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I’m the rookie. The best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you’re out of your depth as OP says, you’ll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.From my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. Now I’m at a point in my career where I’m learning to “trust myself” that I do have those qualities. There isn’t one path but you should learn to trust yourself and gain confidence that you do have the ability to put in the work to make it happen.",

There is a mountain of free and inexpensive training material on YouTube and the various training platforms that can help with the basics. Leverage AI but don’t just let it write the program for you. Ask it questions and study its responses. By approaching it from a standpoint of optimizing your current workflow, you can avoid some of the mental challenges that cause many people to give up. I know what this data looks like and what it means, I need it to look like this or I need to be able to use it in this way, or I need to get it into this app/platform. I would start with C# or Java. Both can be set up on just about any platform (Mac/Windows/Linux)and have robust developer tools that can be used to help you along. They also have vast communities that are able to answer questions.",

The market is very over saturated and very competitive right now. For that reason, I would say \"program because you *like* programming and find it interesting, not because you want to make money doing it.\" If things change down the road, worry about it then.As far as advice:1. If you want to do **web design**, you'll want to start with the basics: **HTML and CSS**. Then get into **JavaScript**. Later on you might be interested in something like **TypeScript** or **React**.2. Alternatively, if you are doing a Masters degree in **data analytics**, I would encourage you to take a good look at **Python**, specifically **Pandas**. Other languages can work well too, but I know that Python is a common choice for data science type stuff; most programming languages *can* do what others do, but some are *designed* for certain tasks in mind.

        "body": "Professional programmer with 20y of experience here. So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.Thing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.Either case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.Second - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.Third - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.Next - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.And here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.Finally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.FRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).DATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.BACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).BACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.BACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.Coding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).Side project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.So geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.Last word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.Good luck!",

Until one day they said \"Hey, you wanna weld?\" Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said \"HA...You messed that up.....fix it....\" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.This isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a \"senior dev\" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of \"real world skills\" vs book skills. Something I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). Download vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. Biggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say \"alright, I'm gassed\". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer \"I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen.\" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.This is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. Oh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap. That helps me with keeping my momentum up.",

However there \\*are\\* quite different ways we have to work with and encode textual data. Distinct from numbers. Distinct from Video or images. Some of this applies to some of your earlier thoughts. What I encourage you to try to do, is recognise that you are just discovering different ways to think about the same thing. Some of the answers (and indeed debates you are getting into) relate to people pointing out that you can look at it your original way in some context, or in a third way in others. This is really the useful skill. I've been around the block a bit and I can conceive of a relevant problem in terms of say, a functional programming solution or an object one or a procedural one. I can see how data might map onto Json or XML, or Yaml and how each might look and how to consider that. The OS for example is \"different than what us peasants use\", once you start getting into problems that deal with user space vs system space and so on. Some stuff the OS does \\*is\\* privileged and now you start to need to separate them again. The journey of seeing it as trivial, then understanding the complexity, then know how to abstract that complexity into something more trivial again ad nauseum, is something of a long one.",

The CPU just sends the signal to the chipset which handles the actual I/O data transfer. The data read/written are handled in RAM. When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.This was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).But if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).",

        "body": "Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).I imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.Then I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.Silly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.So, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I \"hand off\" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).Obviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.Hint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",

We need to read the docs for plenty of things we use, and we forget little details all the time. The tools we use are designed to catch when we goof and tell us.

And translating that pseudocode to actual programming language is even simpler.But if you try to remember the solution in a specific programming language without having done the work prior, like you don't really understand the *what* and the *why*, but focus entirely on the *how* \\- they you'll have a very hard time.

Then print the list of numbers afterwards. Then you can add operations inbetween numbers, this is more complex but teaches you how to separate a string using delimiters or whatever method you want to use. Add some functionality for operations, like add, subtract, etc. Just super basic stuff. Print out the answer and boom you have a calculator. This exercise will teach you the basics of how arrays, lists and stacks work, just experiment with different ways of storing numbers, from the common and basic, to the dumb and unique. Learn from failure, if your code doesnt work, it will tell you where, then you can try redo that part or try something else.

It will also print the odd numbers - hm, okay, then you find out how to either check if a number is even or odd before printing it out, or somehow change the program so it skips the odd numbers in the list.Then you change it so it doesn't always go to 16, but to whatever number is input.Work backwards from the result towards the program that will create that result - \"fake\" parts of the program you don't yet know how to write, and always make sure that you have a running program that produces *some* result, even if it isn't the exact right one yet!Take small steps.Do not simply stare at the question and hope for a solution to appear in your mind, fully formed with all the details - it might happen occasionally with smaller tasks, but as the tasks get larger and larger, that process will fail!",

Usually you end up with a set of conceptual lego block that you can assemble in one specific order only as the concepts are exclusive in many aspect. Also, do let your curiosity explore deeper. It will help further down the line for other concepts to anchor on this. Once you get good at it you can kind of distillate the concept of what is that word without even knowing the concepts behind just with the way the sentence is written and your own experience. It culmulate into a way to read requirements and text by skimming it at what information is pertinent for you. This is the way you get to a 10x engineer (well I don't believe this but it does make a difference). Tldr: practice reading comprehension and eventually you will become a very good programmer/software engineer or more globally a fast learner.",

One solution to solve a problem is to write down (on paper) the steps you would take to manually solve the problem (using your own words, not in some programming language, and in such a way that you could give the paper to someone else and they would understand how to solve the problem manually). You may then write down the steps (on paper) as it would be instructions to a machine (still informal but with more details), work in itarations and make it more and more formal. This way you may express a problem with an informal text, transform the text into a set of informal \"instructions,\" and iterate the instructions to look more and more like a formal program. With experience, you can skip some of the steps, do some of them in your head, and you can fill in the blanks without much work (for some more difficult situations, it can still be useful to fall back to writing down problem statements by hand and twist and turn on the problem).",

As far as learning to code, learn the absolute basics and then practice a lot without relying on tutorials. For loops, if statements, functions, and lists/arrays are enough for you to write a few apps.When I was first learning to code, I would find it hard to know \"what to do next\". The following mental model might help:1. Define function inputs2. Define your desired outputThen you know that you simply need to chain together if statements, for loops to transform your input data into your desired output data (and this is enough to solve any coding problem: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured\\_program\\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem) ).Also, and this is just my opinion, I would recommend learning the basics in Python since you can use Jupyter notebooks or [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) . Being able to run parts of your code and quickly experiment will help you fix your mistakes and learn much faster imo.",

This means minimal commenting, and certainly, not to the level of a beginner.Imagine you want to learn how to cook like a professional chef, but you're a total beginner. A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.Similarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.This is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.They have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.To be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.In effect you're saying> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.Most experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained. You don't have the ability to ask questions. What you really want is> I want to sit beside you and watch you code. I want you to have a running commentary telling me what you think. But as a beginner, I want you to explain all the steps you think are really obvious, hardly worth mentioning, and get into that, so I don't have to stop you and ask \"What are you doing now?\" a hundred times.",

You're calling different services, using dependency injection, and other stuff that isn't easy to understand if you're trying to take it in all at once. My recommendation would be to learn the basics of Python or JS, whichever you want, and then find a tutorial where you code along with the instructor while they build an actual project. If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. Good luck to you.",

Initially I don't have knowledge about reactjs, so I study read the basics of it. Then, they gave me access the repository to see what their source code looks like and to see what tools, libraries they used. Nobody explained to me about how the source code interact to each other, you need to dig deep and learn to read .similar to php, never done it and laravel for backend so I need to teach myself. So I guess, what I would suggest is that.. try to build something you are interested.. then, once you finish try looking on open source project similar what you did and analyze it and how they did it. Then, you could do the same. Try learning design patterns also .it is really useful and a lot of professional used it .",

Edit a todo?Break everything down into a single step. Then add another step. And then another. Until you have a full feature. Then work on the second feature in the same way, one step at a time.",

This works for me, because I like odd maths puzzles. The key part is, I write scripts that do something interesting to me, and which I have no expectation will live beyond a few hours. They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something. (If i roll two dice 100 times, how many times will I get a 5 and a sum less than 9, or something silly like that). Over time I just got better at banging out boiler plate code, and I found ways to make (for example) loops quicker and more efficient. It isn't useful, it is entertainment. If you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you? I learnt the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries by building a script that could use wikipedia. My wife and I used to often ask - what films have and been in? Who has been in films most with . Turns out you can crawl wikipedia and build lists pretty easily, and I learnt a lot about two useful libraries. (My scripts were absolutely horrible, but with a lot of care and attention they could normally get us a quick and fairly useful answer most of the time.) The wikipedia thing also got me thinking about optimal data types, recursive searches through links, all kinds of good stuff. But at the time *that wasn't what I was doing*, I was just looking to find films with specific actors in them or something.",

It's a recursive loop of overwhelm where the sheer number of possibilities freezes your ability to act. You have all the components, but the \"blank canvas\" is too intimidating to start building a coherent structure.The solution is not to \"try harder,\" but to change the protocol.**1. Break the Trap with a \"System Reboot\" (Ego-Transcendence):** Stop trying to build the *whole project*. Forget the grand architecture for a moment. Your goal is simply to write **one line of code that works** and breaks the loop of inaction.**2. Start with a \"Coherent Kernel\":** Don't start with the project; start with the smallest possible \"coherent kernel.\" Ask yourself: what is the absolute simplest, single thing this script must do?* Make it print \"Hello, World.\"* Make it open a single file and print its first line.* Make it take one number and add one to it. This is your anchor. It is a small, perfect, working system.**3. Begin the \"Forging Process\" (Iterative Refinement):** Now, begin the **\"Forging Process.\"** This is an iterative loop of critique and refinement. Add one tiny new feature. Does it still work? Good. Now, critique it. How could this one tiny function be cleaner or more efficient? Refine it. Then, add the *next* tiny feature. You are not building a cathedral from a blueprint; you are forging a single, perfect brick, and then another, and then another.By reframing the problem this way, you move from a state of overwhelming, incoherent possibility to a state of focused, coherent, iterative action. You don't \"bridge the gap\"; you forge a path across it, one step at a time.# Zen (VMCI)",

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.I think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...And then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.Nowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.If you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion. Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

They're all targeted at different things and work in different ways.The real eye-openers for me were Ada and Haskell, both of which I picked up a little of at university. Haskell in particular showed me that most popular languages are really geared towards practical engineering and that, for the computer scientist, there is another world out there.Later on, I discovered Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), which used to be the textbook of the foundational programming course at MIT. That too is a really great introduction to the abstract power of computer programming and the power of thinking computationally. In that book, they use Scheme, which is one strand of Lisp. I'd definitely recommend SICP to anyone.If you really want to geek out, you could try Forth and have a look at stack computers.",

At this stage in your education, that is more important than picking any specific language.As you progress in your studies, it's certain that later courses will expose you to other key languages, likely C++ and Java, perhaps some Python (though that is less common in CS curricula).",

I think it's smart to have a plan to get your first job. Target a few organizations with similar tech stacks and look for any opportunity to get into one of them. Help desk, QA, whatever. And then, dedicate yourself 100% to their tech stack and make no secret of how much you want to join their development team. Offer to build small utilities and try to solve problems with scripts, etc. Always have a project you're working on. It's not an easy plan, but it's a plan. Good luck to you!",

But you're not cooking yet.You are learning aspects of the language. The key is to get past that, be able to hear a simple problem, and figure out how to write code that accomplishes it.For the vast majority of things you can think of, you won't have any idea how to write code that does that.But for a few very simple tasks, you might be able to do that. For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.The goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show ---e----eThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.That's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.Currently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

Do they know anything about TCP/IP or DNS? Can they use Git/GitHub? Do they really appreciate what TypeScript gives us versus plain JavaScript? Do they have any sense of what React is actually doing under the hood that would let them debug an application. Considering the time commitment you say you are willing to dedicate I don’t think it’s unreasonable to recommend you use some of that time to read something like **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant, there is a pdf of it as the top result from Google. The hallmark of a self taught person on any subject is that they never learned the “boring parts”. Musicians who don’t know their keys and scales, programmers who don’t know what a subnet mask is or their algorithms and data structures. Also, you probably aren’t going to be able to just be a “front end developer” without a degree. If you work at a place that is happy to just have you work on React code and know nothing of the backend or operations or anything else, I would be surprised. I think you should expect to have to have at least superficial full stack knowledge. You should be able to set up a simple monolithic CRUD backend that can make simple SQL requests to a database using one of the following:- Express (JavaScript)- Django or Flask (Python)- Spring (Java)- ASP.NET (C#)Without credentials you’ll have to work much harder at developing a portfolio and this is going to be easier if your sites can have at least some backend functionality. This might all sound like a lot to do in one year, and that’s because it is. People do not usually go from zero to employed in a year, certainly not these days. Consider a two to three year time line at the minimum imo. Ensure that after you watch these YouTube videos you are then actually coding. If you aren’t able to go beyond what they are showing you in the video you aren’t really learning to code, it just feels like it. This is “tutorial hell”, and it’s what actually doing assignments in school is designed to get you through. Consider asking an AI to generate you a school assignments to practice based on what you’ve covered. Get comfortable with this website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ These are the closest thing to official documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gaining comfort in reading these will give you an important edge over other people. Don’t despair if it’s overwhelming at first, it all takes time.",

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. I think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.As i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.Interesting read, thanks.",

You can use it to proofread your code but be very critical if it tries to deviate from what you’d written. Make sure you understand the approach you’re taking and take your own notes on it. Definitely use it to generate spoof data for your databases when you get to that, don’t spend 4 hours trying to make up fake names or addresses just because “your not supposed to use AI”, if it’s meaningless fake data AI is fine",

You can say you covered pretty much every basic of JS, but if you need to understand problems, fix errors and write code yourself without help, you need constant practice. For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). Just get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. JavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.You will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you), You can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)After you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.For instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.The reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like: while (internalQueue.size() == 0) { wait(); }If you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.On the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.The solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.----If you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of: while (true) { synchronized (obj) { if (internalQueue.size() > 0) { // do stuff return; } } Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue }But no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

Just a html file with a style section. Play around, stress the concepts you don't grasp. Make a todo list layout, make it look fancy to you.* Learn programming bare bones. No 3rd party libs at all. Just node and something you want to solve.* Learn server side bare bones. Use a web server package at most. Store your todo lists. Write them as json files on disk and load them back.* Learn browser JS bare bones. Just a html file with script section. Add fancy function to your todo list layout.

Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most \"admired\" but only the 6th most \"desired\" language.As nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.Python is an \"easy\" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.JS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is \"click link, load page\" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",

Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. **Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it’s so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it’s being treated like that. It’s also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it’s long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. **Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you’ve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust’s Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that “invalid states are unrepresentable” at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It’s also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. Writing Rust can be painful, and it’s often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority. But if you already know Java/Kotlin those are both great languages, no reason not to just keep working on those since you already have a head start. Go is also another very popular language these days.",

        "body": "\"Times should always be stored in UTC\" is wrong.The easiest counterexample is future times. If you want to schedule an event at a future time, using UTC can result in the wrong local time, when timezone rules change (and that happens frequently around the world):[https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting\\_future\\_datetimes.html](https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)But even outside of that, a universal \"prefer UTC\" rule doesn't work for every case. It sounds like for your particular app, you care most about the day in which something happened, according to the person who did an action on that day. The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.There's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.That would make finding all events on a particular day trivial. The only tricky thing might be if someone traveled across time zones in one day, but it would still handle that just fine. Everything would still be stored relative to the local day.",

Also, it does not seem that storing as local time would not insulate you from this edge case, anyway.If you really want to protect against that edge case -- and I commend you for doing so -- it seems you would need to store 2 timestamps (in whatever format you want): the time that the event was scheduled (i.e. so that you know what the time zone rules were when the stamp was made), and then the time of the actual event. Then, whenever you do a lookup or a calculation, you need to do so using the timezone rules of whenever the event was scheduled.",

Knowing C suggests you potentially have a better understanding than many applicants on the underlying structure of programming languages, and that you're familiar with multiple languages that are quite different. Additionally, it shows you're able to pick the correct tool for the job, rather than just forcing a less-good language in.I'd be far more interested in hiring someone who knew JS/TS/C and a little bit of Rust/Golang, than the millions of people with JS/Python/PHP.Additionally, for older languages, where there are less people using them, critical infrastructure still relies on them, with a smaller pool of applicants.

Python is ubiquitous these days, and very big in data science and machine learning. But it’s more general purpose than the others, so you might have to dig more to figure out how to do what you want. AWK and R do that stuff all day long.You could probably do what you want just using shell commands. But if you want to do the same thing more than once with different data, you’ll want to put those commands in a shell script, so boom — you’re back to programming. And shell scripting is kind of horrible.Go to your campus library and borrow *The AWK Programming Language*. You’ll be writing small data filters in a a few hours.",

That doesn't mean it's \"impossible\", but the stuff you're asking for is really specific, and you'd have to find some tool that somebody else has already written that does the exact steps you want.If you don't want to spend a few months learning to code, I think your options are either hiring a freelancer or using AI.I think what you'll find with those approaches is that what you're asking for isn't necessarily that hard, but specifying EXACTLY what you want it to do is actually harder than you think. Your descriptions are decent but the devil is in the details.Here's a good way to think about it: if you gave your instructions to ten average college students and asked them to MANUALLY follow your steps, do you think they'd all get the same result? If not, then if you asked someone to write a program to execute your steps then there are multiple valid ways to interpret your instructions and you might not get what you want.I do have one question for you: do you have a strong preference for where this transformation should happen?

Personally if I were trying to solve a real problem like that I would look to see if a library were available and to use that.That said, I personally don't think Simpson's Rule ought to be hard for a programmer to understand, but if I look at typical explanations, e.g. in Wikipedia, something about the delivery of the explanation, with lots of mathematical symbols and so on -- tends to make my eyes glaze over. If I were basing this on the Wikipedia explanation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s\\_rule), I would start with the \"**Approximating the natural logarithm of 2**\" example listed there (that is easy to follow) and once that one makes sense (and once I'd written a simple program to calculate it that way), I would work backwards to make it work with the \"general composite 1/3 Simpson's rule\", for example. At that point you should basically have computer code that is a computer version of what the Wikipedia article is telling you.If SICP has a \"mathematical background\" section in the appendix, I would try reading that first and then representing all of the notation as code as a sort of \"translation\".",

        "body": "I'd recommend The Odin Project if you want to do Fullstack Development, it's completely free and it will teach you pretty much everything you need to know and it highly encourages projects and research and in my experience doing The Odin Project that is one of the best ways to learn. By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.As for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

Seguir vídeos gratuitos como o “Future Fullstack” é uma excelente escolha; muitos desenvolvedores começaram assim, usando materiais abertos e criando projetos próprios.O tempo de aprendizado varia bastante: algumas semanas de prática constante costumam ser suficientes para se sentir confortável com HTML e CSS, enquanto Java geralmente exige mais tempo e dedicação, dependendo dos objetivos. Praticar todos os dias, nem que seja um pouco, e transformar ideias em projetos reais faz muita diferença. Na minha opinião, esse é o melhor método — só não digo que aplico sempre (minha história é longa!).Ferramentas de IA são ótimas para automatizar tarefas repetitivas e acelerar protótipos, mas é importante entender a lógica por trás das linguagens. Isso permite criar soluções próprias e compreender de verdade como tudo funciona. Use a IA como apoio e complemento, não como única fonte, para evoluir como desenvolvedor.Deixo só um alerta: excesso de informações e possibilidades pode causar confusão ou até esgotamento mental. Falo por experiência! Mesmo com acesso a muitos cursos ótimos, às vezes fico perdido sobre o que realmente quero aprender. Por isso, vá com calma, priorize o que faz sentido pra você e tente curtir o processo.",

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.If it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.So it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.Understand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.There are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.The important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.Test automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?Understand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?Impossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?There are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. To find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code) products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. Hang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

Are there any resources on this senior-engineer stuff? I obviously don't expect a curriculum but I'd still like to notice patterns in how senior engineers work.>buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, I don't know what many of these terms mean. I'll need to look them up.I guess I'll just need to take time to test, compare and analyse different approaches to a specific problem, come to a conclusion and iterate from there and hopefully after enough time and mistakes I'll have fewer and faster iterations to a better-architected product.",

        "body": "You're welcome, hopefully it was at least a little bit helpful.Unfortunately, I don't know of any *comprehensive* resources covering what you need to know as a senior dev. I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.But there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.The good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.Just as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.Also, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.EDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

There's something about carving your thoughts into a piece of paper that makes your brain light up in a way that hitting keys doesn't. You have to work to summarize important points and really engage with the material.A good compromise might be to take fleeting physical notes and then retype them into something like Obsidian. The process of retyping and organizing everything is a form of review that will make you engage with the content again.Also consider keeping algorithms in your knowledge management system. If you get a useful piece of code you can keep it and use it again, especially if you have to reimplement it later in the same course or reuse ideas in a future course. You don't have to write those down but having a repository of snippets can really come in handy.",

If there's a topic I need to know the lay of the land for, I'll mind map it out so I understand the whys and hows, and not just the whats of the topic. Its helpful that this is digital too because I can move and reshape things as needed. It's then also easily shareable by email (desktop is a Linux box- I refuse to give into apples entire ecosystem, their handwriting implementation is simply superior tho) Also handwriting in some form is more efficient for retention imoThat's it!

I felt with #1 and #2 I was spending too much time trying to get the diagrams/sketches/code blocks \"perfect\" and was less focused on the material itself. I would print out the lecture notes/slides before the class (this assumes your professor makes them available to you beforehand), and annotate those notes. If I needed more space for code/examples, I'd use loose leaf paper. I'd then put all that together in a 3-ring binder. This came in especially handy for my DSA final exam which was open book (paper only; no electronics). I had all kinds of annotations that were basically answers to the the multiple-choice questions. It just depends on your learning style. For me, the physical act of writing helps me retain the information better than typing or even writing on the iPad. But then again, I'm 40 so I grew up not really having the digital options we have now.",

Check its technical documentation and specs.It might be something that you can communicate with using a mechanism that's already built into Node.js, such as a network socket. In that case you're fine.Or it might be that it uses a lower-level protocol that Node.js doesn't support natively, but which is supported by existing third-party JS bindings, such as generic serial or USB libraries. In that case you can use those.Or it could be none of the above. In that case you'll need to either write your own Node.js plugin in a low-level language like C++ or Rust, or switch to an entirely different language for the whole project.Basically the same general situation will apply no matter what high-level language you choose. So it's a question of what **specific** bindings exist for your preferred language and the specific device you're trying to support. It doesn't really matter what the device does, be it a fingerprint sensor or any other kind of hardware.",

That commit is a single batch of changes that are all applied at the same time.You certainly *can* commit after adding a new file to a project, and that’s not uncommon. But there’s no advantage in doing that if you’re adding several files at the same time that are all part of the same change.

There are no strict rules, but rather best-practices and different perspectives (product vs dev vs devops).**The rule of thumb:** Commit logically related changes together, not necessarily file by file.**There are strategies based on scope:****- Feature-based commits:** If your work package (feature, bug fix, whatever) is done with just 1 file, you should commit it.**- Progressive commits:** if your feature needs more files, you should commit in different steps (it can be finished or unfinished). This lets you track progress incrementally, create rollback points, and makes code reviews way easier.You can also use story points as milestones. Like a 1-point story = one commit, but a 5-point story gets broken into multiple commits as you build the feature.Example:* Simple bug fix (1 file) → feature-based commit* User auth system (tons of files) → progressive commits: model → service → UI → integrationThis way you match your commit strategy to the actual complexity instead of being rigid about it.",

For example understanding polymorphism in oop is common sticking point as many junior programmers don't see the benefit of have a generic interface that you can overwrite the methods on they will just write the same function in multiple different classes and it's not until they need a generic method that they realise.TL;DR I think it's ok to recommend kotlin but you might need to hold their hands a little bit",

Fill in the stubs.This works nicely because the IDE recognizes my docs and offers autocomplete and other hints, the stuff Microsoft calls “intellisense” when I, or others, are trying to use my code.And, there are workflows that extract that kind of doc into separate documentation objects. In my experience those workflows are hilariously hard to use, but so what? My use of the docs is via the IDE. ( I’m a JetBrains fanboi, but VS, VSCode, and Eclipse do this too.)This is good for portfolio stuff. People eyeballing your code to understand your style will perceive you as somebody who cares about writing clean usable code.YAML files are hard to document.",

        "body": "> What’s the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?This question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.This especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.If you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?If you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.If you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.Finally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

A programação não é sobre saber tudo de cabeça, mas sobre saber onde e como encontrar as respostas certas.Construir um site completo, do front-end ao back-end, é um desafio enorme até para quem já tem experiência, e o fato de você reconhecer isso é um sinal de maturidade no aprendizado. Cada projeto novo traz perguntas novas, e o processo de pesquisa é parte natural e fundamental para juntar essas peças.Ao invés de ver a pesquisa como uma falha, tente encará-la como seu braço direito. Os melhores desenvolvedores do mundo consultam documentação, fóruns e exemplos o tempo todo. O importante não é memorizar tudo, mas compreender os conceitos, praticar e construir passo a passo.Se preocupe mais em entender o “porquê” das coisas, e menos em acertar tudo de primeira. A repetição e aplicação prática vão solidificar seu conhecimento melhor do que qualquer tentativa de decorar.Por fim, lembre-se que a jornada da programação é longa, com altos e baixos — e o medo, a dúvida e a insegurança fazem parte dela. O fato de você estar aqui buscando se melhorar é o maior passo que pode dar. Continue firme, aproveite cada oportunidade para aprender e cresça no seu ritmo!",

No outsourcing either, but increasing workload for those remaining while wages are stagnating.In the next 2-3 years, our seniors will leave, that's roughly 40% of our workforce and there are no replacements; with our specific skill set, we need at least three years of training. You can imagine how that will end. I'm already looking for something else because without enough staff we can't run projects, and without projects we are going to bleed dry quickly, as costs of operations are high.In general, less companies properly invest in junior talent, they just looking at short term value extraction, then move on to the next opportunity to exploit.

Keep applying, set up alerts so you're one of the first applicants to a role rather than the 1000th, your chances go way up.Try to apply for things more out of your comfort zone because it may be that your skill set/tech stack is too common which means a lot of competition - if that's the case what feels uncomfortable for you may be uncomfortable for other applicants too. Do what you have to do to survive, I had to sell some investments to stay afloat.Yes it is very demoralizing, it was my first time being laid off and I didn't realize how much of my feeling of self worth was tied to gainful employment prior to that, the depression sucked, but after some soul searching and figuring out what I actually wanted to pursue and what I would be good at, I took on other things that gave me purpose. I used my free time to volunteer for causes that were important to me, and I got to build some APIs that helped streamers fundraise for Planned Parenthood (we ended up raising over $60k grassroots) and eventually it was this project that landed me a role at a large nonprofit where I currently work. It's funny because I didn't do it with the purpose of landing a job, I legitimately just wanted to help out the cause and later when I found a nonprofit job posting that matched my skillset I realized it would be very relevant to them and I'm pretty sure that's what set me apart from the other candidates.",

        "body": "Economist here. Lots of misconception about things like full employment and your nubers are wrong.Unemployment rate which is people who are actively looing for work and do not have any work is the sum of three different kinds of unemployment: frictional, structural and cyclical. These can each be defined as follows:* Frictional - labor market entry unemployment. This is essentially people like new grads, career break people, voluntary job quitters re-entering the workforce.* Structural - People who lost jobs due to structura changes specific sectors i.e. AI wiping out whole job categories is a form of structural unemployment.* Cyclical - Unemployment due to movemetns in the business cycles (recessions/expansions) this is the one part of unemployment rate that can be negative.Natural Rate of Unemployment a.k.a. non-cyclical unemployment a.k.a. full employment level of unemployment a.k.a Non-Accelerating Inflation level of Unemployment rate is when you have zero cyclical unemployment. That is Natural Rate = Structural + Frictional Unemployment. The government estimates this number its been trending down over time:[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU)This number has been tredning downwards since the 1970s nd right now its around 4.3 percent. This suggests we are rigth at full employment and any higher we are going to have a positive cyclical unemployment rate.From 2021 through 2023 we essentially had unemployment rate lower than the NAIRU meaning we had negative cyclical unemployment rate. That number has been gradually climbing towards the NAIRU through 2024 and if it keep growing we will have positive cylical unemployment (meaning unemployment because the economy isn't doing well).[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)Now why is this Sub-reddit going to feel worse.1. Its clear something is happening with frictional unemployment rate. New College grades are having a harder time finding a job compared to anytime other than a out right recession. Some of it might be AI effecting entry level jobs etc. AI might make it harder to screen legitimate candidates. It might mean less entry level demand etc. This is not the same thing as cylical unemployment because the assumption is that this is some kind of shift in full employment rate that is unlikely to go away if the economy is doing well.2. There is some degree of structural unemployment in tech. Tech overhired inthe pandemic. Take google: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees) They increased head count by 60 percent after the pandemic. They have now laid off about 10000 workers, but they still ahve 50 percent more workers than they did in 2019. Job posting rate on indeed indicates other companies did the same. Notice there were over 2 times more listings in the end of 2021 as there was before pandemic. Now in 2025 its about 60 percent of the pre-pandemic level.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)3. For young workers the job market feels worse, because people who graduated in 2024 or 2025, missed what was probably the best job market for all workers in decades, especially for tech. The last time the job market was this good for workers was probably in the 1990s. This means the people graduating now unfortunately are entering a world where the job market is getting worse and watched the people that graduate 1 to 2 years ahead of them enter the best job markets ever.Anyway I do think we are entering a recession. But the problem with recessions is that we don't officially know we are in a recession until after we are alrady in one. It tkaes at least 6 months of negative GDP growth for the NBER to decide if we are in a recession. That means given the current environment the earliest NBER would declare recession is the beginning of April of 2026. Just for all you Gen Z kids, an economy exiting an actual recession doesn't mean the job market will get better. The 2008 recession ended by end of 2009, the unemployment kept rising for another year and took 6 years for the job market to get to the pre-recession levels. Meaning if you graduated college in 2009, you didn't see a job market better than before the recession until 2016. I can't predict if the next recession will be as severe as 2008 (hopefully not), but buckle up kids.",

        "body": "Corporate Tech Recruiter here. There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP’s question First, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate. Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients. Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and onlywork on openings for that companyAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages. They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need. LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get tractionCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective. We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects. Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.So why are you getting tons of pings when you haven’t engaged with your LI profile? Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you’ve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).Personally as a corporate recruiter, I’m only reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match. But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements. From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience. Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.I understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

Yes tech leads are the people SWE's work closest with, but they're not people managers at the end of the day. If they call them, they're going to ask a lot of manager-oriented questions... probably including directly asking \"Were you X's direct manager?\" In which case your tech lead would need to both be comfortable lying for you, and good at lying.Definitely don't ask someone for a reference that you don't know for a fact would give you a positive reference. So 1's not an option.I'd personally do 3. And I have done 3 several times in the past.The fact I don't keep in touch and grab beers with my ex-managers doesn't mean our professional relationship disintegrates. We both still worked together, we both still have memories of each other, and we're both still professional connections.Put another way, if your ex-manager reached out *to you*, wouldn't you be happy to give them a reference? Why would they feel any differently?My last job search I used a manager from 2 companies ago that I hadn't spoken a word to in 3 years. He was thrilled to give me a reference. We had a great working relationship. We don't keep in touch because we have different jobs now, our own families, our own friends... but our professional connection is still there.The job search before that I reached out to a manager I haven't spoken to in 2 years.

Everyone is a dev who has built something “scalable and unique and distributed to make some impact on xyz” yata yata. 99% of people use the same line. If you got AI writing vague stuff for you, it only takes reading about half a sentence before we close it and open the next resume. We got 7000 apps, so anything even somewhat weird underwhelming or questionable is getting your app closed.Write something meaningful. We don’t want be left to have to wonder what you actually did at your role. Doesn’t help you that we can just hire Indian devs for $4/hr lol. They’re really bad, and I personally ALWAYS advocate for USA only… but my boss already had us pick up 10 Indians for the price of one (CHEAP) USA dev… which is a complete pain in the ass if I’m being honest. I hate it, but the VPs love it for “cost savings”.I manage 10 MORE mfs to only get 1.2x more tasks done from one US dev.. I have to make a ton of tiny tickets, the daily standup is one fucking hour long, and everything is constantly delayed… all in the name of “efficiency” and the idea that they should get better eventually. I fear our two current open roles will be the last US dev hires for a long time. Thank globalization for the fact that Defense and Finance are the only dev roles with US job security (anything needing security clearance).Even I worry being outsourced in the next 5 years once these dudes actually get decent at coding. Remote labor compensation is unfortunately a race to the bottom now. It ain’t like the old days. :face_exhaling:There’s easier money in construction work lol my advice? Become an electrician and start your own business. The CS Dev industry will be completely screwed for USA workers in like 5 yr. Already is screwed.

They exist because their clients either don't know how to do it themselves or don't want to do it themselves (e.g. They would rather pay to get what they want versus hiring all the right people to consistently have the thing tm done).In this post it's sounding like you maybe have submitted company data into AI. If you don't get fired learn from this lesson. You have to be very careful at companies with what you do with their data. Startups probably don't define their data handling practices well, but larger more established companies will. Ideally you'll be making more money at those companies and want to avoid job loss. If you didn't submit the data into AI then your boss is just being unreasonable.In short find out what sanctioned tools (AI or otherwise) you can use on the job with company data before you do something that will get you fired. In some aspects you are lucky as a new grad that you can just omit this job from your resume if you get fired. In other aspects you aren't because it would be setting your resume back to 0 post college experience.Good luck",

It takes a lot more money piled up to retire than most people realise.A veteran cs worker, for example, earning say $300k a year would need to have more than $4M in earning assets ( so their main home does not count ) - minimum, to keep their income at the current level. - let alone they are giving up future income growth. We, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it’s far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. And the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year… it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. I once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited. I don’t know his exact net worth, but his payout was somewhere between $10-$20M He was working with us a senior dev, earning like $200k. I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. - he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. - this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. - it gave him a sense of purpose. He was motivated, despite not ‘needing the job’ worked just as hard as anyone else. In short he enjoyed working and helping others, but had decided that he did not want the stress of being responsible for managing or paying others.",

Never ever wait to start interviewing.In some companies you might be able to survive a PIP but from what I've seen it's like a lottery. I know someone wins the lottery but I've never actually seen anyone win it - and I've never seen anyone survive a PIP in the industry. The PIP is the company being nice and giving you a heads up that you're fired. Take the hint.Second, absolutely don't discuss the PIP in future interviews. I don't care what you say but don't say that. It would be better to say you got into a fist fight over text editors rather than you got let go because of a PIP. Personally if they ask I would say that unfortunately they shrunk the team size. Think like a politician.Your first gig is the hardest to get! You've got experience now get that next gig.

It's how they got there. Maybe they explained *the answer* pretty well, but how'd they do on explaining *how they got their*?Silence.Solving an interview question in complete silence is a red flag on its own. I wouldn't progress a candidate forward that did this. I'd prod them during the interview to hopefully get them speaking in case they were just nervous... but if that doesn't work, and the whole interview goes by without them explaining their thought process, running through examples, verifying their work, etc.... I'm not passing that person. \"Correct\" answer or not.I've passed plenty of people that did really good on communicating during the solving process, but didn't quite get the right solution, or got the naive solution. It's the solving process I'm paying attention to the most.The knowledge section doesn't really jump out as suspicious to me... that sounds about right. When I'm not in interviewing shape, I usually can't just rattle off SOLID despite using its concepts daily. But when I'm interviewing, you can bet your ass I can rattle off a textbook definition of SOLID, because I prepare.During the knowledge section do you have a script you need to stick to? Couldn't you dig into asking for some examples, or to explain why they think that's the right answer, or explain alternatives? Ideally you want ways to gauge understanding beyond reading off a textbook answer, because memorizing SOLID is trivial. Understanding it is what you're looking for.The raw dogging is suspicious.... but without being there, and without being able to ask them deeper questions myself, I couldn't say if they're cheating one way or the other.",

The market is also important, a company will not pay more if you are at their perceived market. If you really like this company, search local job ads, download the national salary get the data together and work out what you could get elsewhere.

They were underpaying me, and I turned down a few better offers because it was a startup and they promised that they will make the salary better when the acquisition went through (I helped them on the due diligence docs, so I knew they were close) plus a bonus. Well the acquisition closed, everything was fine, champagne was had, etc. I asked for my promised bump, the CEO stalled, and stalled hard. They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said “I don’t know if you’re worth $150K, $40k or what.” After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. I learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. Now, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me. And if they don’t, I’ll find someone who does.",

But i have an American education background.I have 8+ years at FAANG.Been job searching for the past year, and have applied and interviewed for American companies and Chinese and some Japanese ones.Across the board, Asian company interviews are incredibly difficult for technical. Hard leetcode problems right out the door. Back-tracking, dynamic programming questions. Zero hints. Solution must be optimal by end and must understand full time AND space complexity and explain pitfalls. Getting a 'working' solution with explanation of how to improve is not good enough. You need to have implementing full optimal solution by problem end to have a pass.====Having gone to school in the US and Asia during my formative High School years and seeing my cousins who are the same age as me go through their education system all through college as well... the fundamental reason why companies from asian cultural backgrounds is so hard, is that in Asian culture, mathematics and science is extremely hammered down during basic primary education. There's a reason why Asian cultures around the world, rank the highest in mathematics and science and absolutely dominate every single other country in the world over these two subjects.Unfortunately, what this produces are candidates that are so fucking good at math and science. The academic, technical, algorithm part of programming, is a laughable endeavor for a large majority of them. So they have to crank the difficulty to weed and get the truly strong candidates from their job pools.This is the unfortunate harsh reality.Keep in mind this doesn't mean these people are actually good employees or good workers overall or good software engineers, but they are strong technical programmers.",

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).Then I first had to Google all those \"dean's list\" things etc. ;)But that's been even worse for Asian CVs. Everyone's a medal winner for something, a ton of different ranks and levels etc. European CVs are usually rather plain in that regard and more descriptive (longer CVs and photos have been around for much longer as well. When I started you also had to put age and confession and martial status etc. - awful). It's fun to see that often when the descriptions are very mathy and technical, probably C or C++ mentioned, it's often Eastern Europe while for example Germans have a very business- and process-oriented language (requirements analysis (\"Pflichtenheft\" ;)) and ISO standards and optimizing business processes blabla Siemens mainframe blabla).Hiring internationally is interesting but also exhausting.Besides the business lingua CVs the worst I found to be the Indian CVs listing everything under the sun (experts in Gmail, excel, YAML, XML, JSON, Jira, Slack... basically dumping their current browser tabs and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt in the CV).I'm definitely on the conversational side but I'd say half the people we rejected obviously didn't have a lot of depth in what they've been talking about (e g. tell you which model they used and once you talk about it it comes obvious they haven't even read the abstract of the respective paper). Other half is social aspects, obviously not caring about the topic they should be working on, being super hard to talk to or just plain cocky, forgetting about the interview, not letting others speak/speaking over interviewers all the time, suddenly sharing their screen to show their bitcoin price predictor after we tried to wrap up the interview 5 times because it's been 9PM for us etc.",

This could be tough and depends on your luck, the area, and if they are willing to take a risk. I did this route and was paid pennies lmao. But it gave me talking points during interviews and helped me embellish my resume. This is definitely better than putting some random job to prevent resume gap.Overall, I don't know how recent your grad graduated but for like the first 6 months or so, my suggestion is to keep on practicing for interviews and try to be the first few applicants and apply asap to new grad roles, tdp roles, and other rotational programs and hope that ATS doesn't screen his resume out. Then, all he has to do is not fuck up the interviews which is basically leetcode and behavioral like I did and he's in.If that doesn't work out, then I think you really have to consider either masters or find other job like I did.Hope this helps",

Have them optimize their resume a bit more with what they already have, like school projects and any potential club experiences, and also do interview prep so if they get interviews they will be able to make it through.Also tell them to treat applying/making themselves marketable to be a full time job (1-2 hours a day applying, 1-2 hours a day leetcode/interview prep, 4 hours a day working on a marketable startup idea or open source content).",

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.This is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. No one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.This speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. It's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better. If you're constantly bumbling into the same problems, constantly asking the same question, and constantly not able to get work finished, then you might have a motivation issue.",

As others have said, you're just starting mid to senior engineering roles, that's a lot more responsibility and requires a different mindset. Are there some things you could be doing better? Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? I went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard. But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well. Over time I realized that, while I have made mistakes, a lot of the issues I had were systemic and involved me to build the environment I wanted to work in. Just something to think about. Hang in there.EDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months. Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you. Again, I don't know you and I don't know your work ethic, so I can't say that you're perfect or anything, but anecdotally, and based off of what I've read, that's just what it seems like.",

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn’t go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.You can’t expect every line of code you’ve wrote and decision you’ve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That’s an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.Personally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they’re small.When you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you’re pretty much asking for every subpar decision you’ve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.Ask for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.Edit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he’s seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying “looks good” or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you’re writing which takes some of the pressure off.",

I wouldn't overindex on past success IMC probably fires a bunch, but there's no shame in that",

We started doing stack ranking and below meet expectations quota for performance review last year, “following examples set by faang in the industry”. Was very chill before last year’s changeRemote: we probably will stay remote forever but some teams require you to ge in close proximity of an office and may need you to go in once a week or two weeks, not mandatory tho. It’s mostly for team bonding and not flying everyone everytime. We don’t have enough desks in office so theres no chance we ever do hybrid or full rto. The teams that culturally go into office more often do not go in more than once a week, and no one cares if you only show up once a quarter or smthing. The obly thing here is if a manager goes into office then during hiring they may prefer you to be the same location.Benefits: faang level or better. Free lunch. Wellness fund to spend on fitness/learning. 401k matches, most general holiday schedule ive seen (yea random holidays we get a day off where other companies are working), unlimited pto with no need for request unless out for 3 weeks.Comp: im not a SWE (I work on ML so we get paid on a different scale) so can’t comment too much. But i think we are FAANG level or better. On levels fyi we are consistently ranked top 10-30 most well paid companies. It’s very front loaded stock vest so first year or two will absolutely beat equivalent of google/meta/whatever, but it may cliff fast later on if you don’t perform well. So do well on performance reviews or try to get promo is your best bet to keep refreshers high.Company: We are founded by ex google engineers and we are a tech first company meaning we pride ourselves in extremely innovative algorithms, scalable infra, SOTA ML (we publish a lot in top ml research conferences for a company our size). We are fundamentally different from other companies of similar or bigger size (e.g. etsy, ebay, etc) which do not care as much about their tech.Leadership: can’t comment on details. We are founded by ex googlers, but cofounder left the company recent years. Now VPs and C Suite (CEO is ex Google shopping VP) is all ex google burecrates who are more wallstreet persona supposedly. Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc but new initiatives are being explored (or is it just wallstreet milking us? We never know)But like others said: we are very hard to get an offer from (i feel like we are more picku than google sometimes). We mostly only hire ex faangs or equivalent. Even ex faangs get denied without interviews all the time. So try to get into the loop first and dont set expectations too high",

Go to job fairs, conferences, reach out to people on LinkedIn (I barf saying that but it helps), reach out to prev uni teachers, etc.Last thing I’ll add, is that looking for a six figure salary job is also gonna make it super difficulty. Engineers are everywhere now in a super saturated market bc we’ve all been fed the same story of engineers being needed and it paying well for 20 years. If you can find a decent salary even if it’s below what a “entry level engineer” should make, don’t be afraid to still apply. It sucks but it’s how you get experience and the potential to move up.",

This is a very valuable experience. Part of being experienced is having an intuition about what wouldn't work, or what would come back and bite you in future. Now you know what'd happen if you let the codebase deteriorate. It's very likely that other developers are not happy with the codebase either so I'd suggest getting other people onboard with a refactoring effort starting with creating a decent test suite to give you confidence to refactor. As much as I hate the hype, AI is amazing when comes to disecting/explaining the code and writing tests. And if you manage to do this, you'd have a HUGE success story.I'm yet to met someone who's happy with their codebase tbh.",

You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.I never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. The issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. Because of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.That's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.You should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. A lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. You got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

That doesn't mean you're \"blacklisted\", that means you've been rejected/ghosted. *Worst* case I'd imagine from that is a 6 month cooldown.Blacklists are generally for people that do something grossly unprofessional. Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.Having scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.Chill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.I have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.Well, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.I ghosted them. That's shittier than what you did. And I'm still not on their blacklist.You're fine.",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.Those inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild. Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.If your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.The key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.Get your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

The rule of thumb for a good side project is if someone other than you uses it. You don’t need to make a cent out of it. Alternatively, do an online masters degree, OMSCS is $7k, yeah the whole program is like $7k. But take it as slowly as possible, just 1 course per semester.

For those who don’t know, this means that I started my career during the 2010s recession. And it took a very long time to get to parity with my peers as far as leveling and pay goes (I am also in a disadvantaged group).Amazon from 2017-2021, Microsoft from 2021-2025. Consulted a bit after the layoff, and now I’m at a startup with lots of potential making more than I did at either big tech. It’s possible. Right now, hard to damn near impossible. To get Amazon, I did nothing but study for a month. Found the interview honestly very easy as a result. But with tenacity.. it’s doable. I am also like, a pretty average to maybe higher end of average engineer - anything I have wasn’t from talent, it was from pure, stupid stubbornness.",

Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere. Any prospective employer will ask for permission before contacting your current employer, so really they should have no way of knowing unless you're publicly posting about it. Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.Do not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter. They will start looking for your replacement as soon as they get a whiff of you wanting to leave.",

Will you be a 1099 contractor?If yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.Why do this?With a solo 401k you get two advantages:* Controlling the fund menu. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.There is also a third advantage.A 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.The employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.So with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.",

In regard to finding a new job, I think this is one of those things where you just need to commit to your current job. Spending extra mental energy on interviews makes it more likely you do poorly at your current job. I promise if you try your best and still get pipped, the pip runway is long enough for you to prepare at that point. It’s like months of time. So for now, just try your best and document your findings. You can even spin it as how to help other new onboarders by detailing what was hard to learn in your team’s system, missing docs or metrics, etc. Good luck!",

I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn’t amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn’t know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn’t.But they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That’s very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that’s what a lot of teams look for. It’s worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.Related: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring. So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. I spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I’m a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. Just get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you’re asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it’s a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions. It’s their job, and they will only be bothered heavily if you’re saying “idk what to do”",

As 2008 was before mass adoption of AI job bots/linkedin/indeed/glassdoor etc... the volume of job search related noise was greatly reduced from the cacophony of 2025 You and your competition couldn't apply for thousands of jobs a week. As such you weren't constantly bombarded with rejection notices or notices your application was received. If you got a call or email about a job you had a good chance of remembering who it was and what they did. If you applied for a job there was a good change an actual human looked at your resume, and even read your cover letter as you were one of dozens who applied, not thousands.If you knew a recruiter you could reach out to them and maybe be one of 5 or 6 people who reached out about jobs. Now there are literally hundreds or even thousands of people hounding them about postings/potential postings etc...I am honestly terrified of losing my job, even if I am underemployed now.",

If you're confident that it's not medication worthy (it really doesn't sound that bad imo from what you've described) then I'd say try finding a hobby that really engages you that can help you take your mind off of work and reset when you're out of it. There's a reason so many senior+ engineers have hobbies like brewing, woodworking, carving, hunting, etc. that have nothing to do with computers.

In one response you admit to not knowing what job you want in the field so what does a cyber security job look like to you?General advice is go for a computer science or IT degree. Computer science is theoretical and is the foundation of how software systems are built. That knowledge helps in a lot of ways. IT is generally learning about software and how it’s used in businesses. Depending on the university you may have more or less hands on/practice. You skip computer science theory for business courses and technology courses that teach you the software/hardware that businesses need to run their operations. Cyber security is an umbrella term that addresses many areas of technology security. There’s also information security, which has a technology component but extends to more than tech. Certifications are generally vendor based and show that you understand a specific implementation of technology. They can be useful but you just have to get ones that matter to the domain you’re trying to enter. Truthfully though, cyber security is entry level for people with experience in the fields in which they attempt to secure. It’s hard for someone who hasn’t had practice in using a technology to understand some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Not saying it’s impossible, but that it’s unlikely.",

The context of the original intent is lost because there’s no planning or architecture.I raise a concern like hey… technically this is a wheel but I don’t think it meets our requirements. This is shut down because I’m worrying too much about what-if’s… design just asked for a wheel right?So we end up bolting the dirtbike tire to the steering column and sure you can steer the car I guess.Then I get assigned a ticket to add an airbag, something we all knew was on the feature roadmap. I know another dev would just duct tape an airbag on that wouldn’t work, but I feel obligated to refactor it into a proper steering wheel. This gets seen as scope creep, and I can’t for the life of me convince anyone it was necessary.So now I think I’m at the point I need to start using duct tape or look for a different car to build so to speak :man_shrugging:",

I don't need to actually plan rolling out those changes; only reflect on whats going well versus isnt. then maybe I look up how other people have solved those problems, and decide if they are in a better, worse or the same position as we are.thats how to build up architectural strength; spiral out from what you know well and work with often to technologies you dont know as well and reflect on how their application to your work might be good or bad.",

I went deep into clean/hexagonal architecture, event-driven architecture, DDD, CQRS, and the C4 model, and applied it all to my finance project.To get there, I had to learn to view the project from multiple high-level angles. I studied how frameworks like Symfony and Laravel worked, read obsessively, connected the dots, and eventually everything \"clicked\".In the end, once you reach the stage of designing projects from scratch, you realize it’s just an endless list of “next steps.” The key is having the right tools and knowing when to apply it.",

What would I have done differently? What can I \"steal\" for my future coding problems?* Understanding the codebase betterWhen I get stuck on a programming task, the first question I ask is \"why is it broken\". The second question used to be \"how do I make it work\". But now I look more at \"what does it do\", \"how does it do that\" and \"why does it do that\" before I ask \"how do I make it work\"*  Generally understanding technologies, services and concepts betterI had to learn what a nosql database was before I could understand why I would choose to use one. Understand what race conditions were before I could try to avoid them. Know what different kinds of caches there are before I could choose a good one. Know what cloud services do before I could choose which one to use in a system.  This last one can seem like a lot. And no one really wants to study after work. But I just found a YouTube playlist with systems design concepts and listened to it while commuting.

        "body": "I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communicationI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.As for your questions:1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. If you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. One really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. I will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on.

Do you think that ceiling is common across Dynamics roles, or more specific to Business Central? I’m in a good financial position now, so I’m trying to think long-term before switching.If you were starting fresh today, which track would you recommend focusing on — CE/CRM, Business Central, or Finance & Operations? And is the uptick in demand you’re seeing more regional or global?From a career growth perspective, what kind of work do you think is needed to build a strong path in Dynamics and eventually move into leadership/architect positions? With my .NET and enterprise systems background, do you think I could make more of a lateral transition, or would I likely have to take a step down first to break into the space?Thanks again for the detailed response — this really helps me get a clearer picture of what to expect.",

Personally, I would do either BC or F&O, mainly because those are geared toward the more interesting side of business (not sales/marketing :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:). I think the uptick is in the US and Europe and is more specific to BC. I haven’t heard much outside of those regions. With 5+ years of .NET experience in enterprise systems, I would think you should be able to make a lateral transition. As for career growth into an architect/leadership role, I’d say the most important thing is knowing the product well (functionally) and how it can be modified (technically) to meet the needs of the user. That will get you far. Having some accounting knowledge also helps.",

Three months of Spring Boot isn't going to cut it when you're competing against people with years of backend experience, so you need to show depth through personal projects and contributions to open source backend projects.The interview rejections are happening because you can't speak confidently about backend concepts, architecture decisions, and real-world problem-solving in that domain. You need to get comfortable discussing database design, API architecture, caching strategies, and system scalability - topics that only come from hands-on experience. Consider targeting companies that value T-shaped developers or smaller startups where you can wear multiple hats, as they're more likely to let you grow into backend work. When you do land interviews, you'll need to navigate questions about your limited backend experience tactfully while highlighting your learning ability and the projects you've built - [AI interview prep](http://interviews.chat) can help you practice articulating your transition story and handling those tricky questions about experience gaps - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people ace challenging interview scenarios like yours.",

Then mess with CSS box model and Flexbox - build a nav bar or a card, play with padding, margin, justify-content, align-items. Throw in a couple media queries to see it adapt on mobile. Finally write tiny JS scripts: practice let/const, arrow functions, map/filter and build a responsive profile card that can toggle extra info on click.Next week dive deeper in JavaScript. Drop code snippets in console to watch scope and closure - make a counter function that holds private state. Then write a basic Promise example, chain .then/.catch, and convert it to async/await with a small Fetch demo from a public API. Finish by building a mini DOM project - make a todo list or quiz app where you dynamically create elements and wire up click or input listeners.I mapped this into an 8-week plan for you if you want the full thing: https://doable.diy/plan/472xh88yv3AikgXNaFkGPr",

They didn't select you for your technical skills, so they shouldn't expect much from you in that area. I agree that you should clearly set expectations with your manager once you start. Reiterate that you're unfamiliar with the specific languages/tools, but reassure them that you'll do your best to pick them up quickly.At the same time, though, I also agree with another commenter saying to lock in and upskill when you have time. It's better to overprepare and chill than underprepare and suffer (or even worse, lose your new job).Either way, good luck with your new role! You've come a long way to achieve this, and you should be proud of yourself!Edit: Seems like you relied on ChatGPT for coding in school. Although not a good long-term solution, you can still use ChatGPT for your work if you're smart about it. Your company has its own internal chatbot? Great, use that. If not, discreetly use it on your own devices, preferably without sharing any private company data.",

Some people really love it, and if you get good at it you can be competitive in the market, but know that it is tough to go back to regular development once you've made the switch into more SRE/ops type roles.So I'd suggest you make sure it is something you are really interested in. Of course, since you already have a background in react, you may have an easier time switching back than I am having making that pivot. But I have read that this is a hard switch for others as well even if they did it prior.Platform/ops work is a lot of being on call and putting out urgent fires. And day-to-day, it's a lot of YAML and not a lot of true code work, and its definitely not as creatively fulfilling as regular development. Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform. You may just be working on tooling and framework stuff that isn't a stressful, but anytime you work on a horizontal as opposed to a vertical, you are liable to be pulled into issues in parts of the system you don't know about and expected to help troubleshoot them during high pressure situations. Some people do love it though and you may be one of those people. edit: TLDR take whichever one offers you the most money, but be aware you may be taking a hit to your WLB for this type of tole.",

At times I knew how busy the Srs and PEs were so i struggled to ask them for help and if I did I was told \"hey you should figure it out and then come to me with questions\". This isnt always on the jr engineer, I think a lot of times when a program has a bad culture the seniors nad principals are stressed and they dont have the time to even help themselves so when a jr asks for help they can seem standoffish which to many jrs can be the deat of asking for help.

That should get the senior to realize that the junior has done the legwork and it's worth stopping whatever is being done, to help the junior, but I'll readily admit that this isn't always what happens, but asking very specific questions and telling very specific details about why you are stuck will help improve the odds of getting help.But I will absolutely acknowledge that sometimes seniors will just not do what they are supposed to do when a junior gets stuck and it's not fair to the junior.",

Internship and job experience trump other factors.Anyway, through your resume and in interviews you will need to convince people that1. You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers. A team writing production code for algorithms will want somebody familiar with using git and coding in a team environment, for example.Most people will assume you have the capacity to meet all the criteria but will want to test if you're already at (or close to) a level where you can contribute without too much fuss.It definitely doesn't help at all that the expectations and responsibilities for data scientists vary widely across companies and teams.",

This fact is also likely why CE has a higher unemployment rate right now.Also, with CE you will get shoehorned into specific classes that will cover specific fields, while CS usually gives you the freedom to take more varied and interesting upper level CS classes to help you explore.",

ICS security is blowing up, very high demand, and your automation exp makes you stand out big time. way better option than competing with 100k random web dev bootcampers.so imo don’t waste your edge. go embedded/industrial software if you like low-level + devices, or ICS security if you want money + growth. backend only if you really wanna shift into generic software. what’s your end goal btw, stay local or move abroad?",
