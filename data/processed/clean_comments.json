There are perhaps three, at most five, major players in the data warehouse space. Many vendors have started to just build push-type integrations with each of them; this isn't that difficult to maintain and has numerous advantages over some external service running big extractions on a schedule. They can point to what Fivetran would charge to shift that data and make it a selling point.Where does Fivetran fit into this? They don't. They're being cut out.Worse, they've got much cheaper, open core competitors with cloud offerings whose main disadvantage is that they don't have the long tail of connectors. But this advantage is constantly being eroded, and the long tail is, by definition, less marginally lucrative the further you push into it.So what's the play? Seems to me that their plan is to- take advantage of existing lock-in: jack up prices- accept the resulting churn; it'll happen anyway if nothing changes- use the windfall to power a set of acquisitions that amount to a land-grab of other, more defensible parts of the data stackThoughts?",

Spark optimization is always good to know but there are many nuances to this in real-world applications. Other topics you mentioned are a bit more specialized. I think you can move on to other DE topics. Besides these are very company dependent. Some companies may used Spark but then you might find out that very few of their pipelines actually use Spark.",

Do spend the time to learn git though. That is life changing. And always keep an eye out for what best practices are in any given situation, but balance it with real world pragmatism. That’s an art, and really hard to figure out. So anyway, best of luck, and you’re not a fraud :)",

Exceptions exist when you’ve got a highly talented team, strong communication, and a big budget, but most companies can’t afford that luxury.If you’re not in banking or another high-risk industry, it’s worth lowering expectations.

No PRs should be accepted unless the owner of the data (preferably a senior/experienced dev) approves it.* Idempotency, idempotency, idempotency. Probably the most crucial part of any data warehouse pipeline. It is really not that hard to implement these days (most modern pipelines and warehouses have multiple ways to enforce it). Prevents 95%+ of data inconsistency issues in production.* Backwards/forwards compatible transfer protocol. My current favorite is Protobuf (or proto-adjacent forks) for its 'data-contract'-iness behavior, but Avro + schema registry works too (though I personally hate having to manage yet one more cog in the flow)* Monorepo your schemas. Slightly controversial take, but this helps definitions/migrations fail at *compilation time*, which in my experience reduces runtime problems by orders of magnitude.* Pick a database that can be locally initialized via a container, and keep an append-only log of all migrations in git. This makes testing so much more reproducible, and makes it quite rare to have unexpected issues in production you didn't find at the test phase.In my experience following most/all of these makes everything else follow naturally in place.",

Refactoring generally doesn't have much ROI either unless it establishes cost savings or development velocity. If you have to manually massage some process all the time, they don't care unless it's blocking you from releasing new stuff. They also wonder why you didn't \"do it right the first time\". They also don't want to invest more money to rebuild a platform that they already paid for, so you often get stuck with the crap they paid some consulting firm to build and have to slowly fix it over time.TBH this isn't a data warehouse thing, this is a general IT thing where you sort of wait around for some lull in requests to do that kind of stuff. My company has a billing platform that they implemented 15 years ago and over time implemented every new significant product line differently, such that the processes were all unique. That's a core system to our revenue cycle and has had several customer impacting deficiencies, but they are only now really able to go back and do it right because there isn't a huge backlog.",

But I have experienced a well done take home test, where the HR actually asked me when I would like it to be sent, so I have a chance to plan out the time to do it. I was given 3 days from the time they sent it, and the test was quite standard DE stuff (data modeling and SQL, create a batch processing job, design Architecture for a data streaming platform). In this case though, I think you did dodge a bullet, because I have not heard of anyone hiring based on their ability to 'learn new domain', at least not as a DE. Data scientists/researcher maybe. I work in a financial institution doing DE on financial models. I will not take responsibility for any of the financial model calculations, and only implement based on clear requirements. Expecting me to do non trivial stuff I am not trained for is a liability I would not want.",

These aren't things that DuckDB spatial can't or won't do, but they are things that DuckDB hasn't prioritized over the last year that are essential to a lot of spatial pipelines.SedonaDB will also release raster support (its being worked on).

A former US employer had dabbled in Palantir then moved away from it quite rapidly once they understood what they were getting into.Here's a link to some more information about the NHS Federated Data Platform, that gives some insight into what exactly it is from a technical perspective. https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/nhs-federated-data-platform/how-does-the-nhs-federated-data-platform-work/My main reaction is that lock in is nothing new for the NHS. It's obviously not ideal, but equally, NHS trusts and the central NHS bodies are very used to fighting their way out from locked-in information systems. And when you're one of the ten largest employers in the world, you do have a fair bit of clout for getting past lock in. I can't speak to whether Foundry is a good choice here technically speaking, but IF it is, it's probably better for the NHS to have a good technical solution with lock in, than a worse technical solution without lock in.",

Create one unified **events** table with polymorphic rows: `event_name`, `event_timestamp`, `user_id`, `device_id`, `session_id`, `trace_id`, and a `payload` (JSON/VARIANT) per event. Let the schema evolve by versioning (`event_version`) instead of spawning new tables.* Columnar stores/lakes are built for this. Partition by date/hour; cluster/z-order by `event_name`, `user_id` (and optionally `session_id`). Only break out separate tables for dimensional models or specific serving use-cases (e.g., a narrow “page\\_views” mart), not for raw ingestion.* Identity & causality: require source-side IDs. Minimum viable set: `event_id` (UUID), `user_id` (or `user_pseudo_id`), `device_id`, `session_id`, and a `trace_id`/`parent_event_id` for linking (think W3C Trace Context / OpenTelemetry). If long-lived cookies aren’t allowed, do deterministic or probabilistic sessionization early in the pipeline (sliding time windows, inactivity thresholds). Also emit join keys for common patterns (e.g., `impression_id` on view + `click` carries that id).* At your scale (hundreds of millions/day): append-only raw, dedupe on `(event_id)`; compact small files; enforce a schema registry; backfill via streaming + incremental merge; materialize derived marts for sessions, funnels, and attribution. This avoids N-way unions at read time.* Trade-offs: you can’t max scalability, usability, and simplicity simultaneously. Declare priorities and the costs you accept (e.g., “optimize analytical latency and cost; accept slightly higher model complexity”).",

Do not let the SEs drag your analytics down the toilet just because they can’t figure out how to tie a session with a sequence of JSON events. Even better, ask them to include both sesion id as well as a sequence number that signifies the step id in their orchestrated workflows. First time I faced this problem was back in 2008 when building a data warehouse on top of such clickstream events and we literally had to rebuild our entire event tagging system just to be able to make any sense of the insights we wanted to glean from that data.",

Our event system has 70+ different shapes, sometimes wrapped in envelopes, sometimes as straight events on Kafka as binary protobufs and I consume them via Flink in 3 distinct jobs. We do some redaction and add metadata.Ignoring the Scala part of it since that wasn't the question, the key points (I did this when I was a team of one) are essentially:- `protobuf`/any version controlled schema that supports evolution- A source of truth for permutations (e.g. an ADT/enum/proto) that stays up-to-date- Code gen: Avro schemas from protobufs (`avro4s` and `scalapb` for us) + potentially metadata injection- Generic, re-usable code (e.g., we have a `Pipeline[A <: GeneratedMessage : Redacted]`, rather than a `EventAPipeline`. All all composed services are generic, too)- Tests tests tests (including generic ones that iterate possible permutations)- CI to enforce said tests (e.g., somebody changes the protobuf and introduces an incompatible type, fail their build and have them talk to you)- Naturally, a scalable database to back this - Iceberg has been treating us well, but I'm also a big fan of Clickhouse, which can do some of the aggregation for youThis is a bit outdated but also has some details on what I did: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-we-built-ngroks-data-platform#scaling-apache-flink-scala-and-protobuf-to-650-gbday We don't do any pre-aggregation on purpose, but I suppose you could do that if you wanted to.fwiw you might want to solve #2 first and might even consider a vendor product for it.",

I saw people doing separate tables for every type of event and I always wondered what's the gain here. You'll end up with one enormous \"views\" table and hundreds of small various size tables. Most queries won't filter by event type. I guess if you're organizing it in a bucket it should follow hierarchy: platform -> date (yyyy-mm-dd) -> event type since most queries will probably be filtering by date and platform. But then on the abstraction side of things... analysts should see just one big table. How you do it will depend on the tech you'll use so here's where I shut up.",

Might i ask, why dags and not a tool like open metadata for cataloging where you get a bajillion features without development work for the cost of a kube clustet or some vms and elasticsearch? It would be a good idea to look into dbt for analytics engineering as well as spark and try some complex sql (rows between and etc.). After 12 years, I also just stumbled onto ckann. Guessing you are more open source like me. Dbt has an equivalent in pure gcp but cuts across all popular systems. A solid side project from data collection (try out dagster) to data modelling to ml models, agents, and llms is a good idea. An llm can help you find answers to questions quickly. Dont use it as a crutch. They tend to require very detailed requirements to do basic work and screw up a lot.",

Like I said, I was dealing with tens of thousands of simulation files regularly on hardware that would make you cry. This volume is nothing for current systems.Second. You'll probably have to deal with files regardless. Most simulation software (I'm assuming it's a simulation, Markov chain analysis, probably?) dumps to files, though maybe yours can dump to a db. Doesn't matter.What I would do is let them save everything to a bucket/blob/network drive/whatever then have your warehouse pick it up from there and stuff into a database. You can easily add the filename and other metadata during ingest and then you can serve it up to them nicely from the database. Everyone is happy.As for executing over 30 days, that's a single Python/bash/CLI of your choice script. Since it's an optimisation problem, I'm guessing you're setting up hyper parameters for each run. You can do that with a CSV and a short script to pick up the values for each run.Don't over complicate it. This is a pretty simple exercise.",

Most GenAI tools will either hit token limits or lose important context when processing documents that large. What you really need is proper document chunking with semantic understanding so when someone asks about a specific rule, the AI gets the right section plus relevant context from other parts of the document. We built Docstrange by Nanonets specifically for this kind of challenge because traditional PDF processing just dumps everything as flat text and loses the logical flow that's crucial for regulatory documents. You might want to consider breaking those massive PDFs into smaller, logically structured sections while maintaining cross references, that way AI tools can actually give accurate answers instead of getting lost in 300 pages of text.",

This centralization is useful to avoid duplicated data infrastructures, for examples having 2 DE teams developing their own ETL framework can be wasteful.2. A data person (potentially more than one) within a business team who is fully aligned with the business objectives but has enough technicality to interact with the data infrastructure team. It could be a DA, BIE, AE or DE. This data person should be able to answer their business team's data questions by querying the data warehouse, creating dashboards and creating new data pipelines.",

I think they need an entire team to be honest.One thing that annoys me is that executive reporting drives most of our reporting work. We need to build out full-on Kimball models because the accuracy of these reports is questioned at the microscopic level. They get looked at for a few minutes every month and are used for strategic decisions where a few hundred dollars isn’t going to change any strategy. Yet we must focus on those minor discrepancies.I disagree with a centralized data infrastructure team. What I have learned is that ”Centralized” is just gatekeeping and creating a new bottleneck.Do you know what operations does when IT can’t build an app fast enough, or it takes months to build a data model and report?They just do it all outside the authorized structure and build it in excel and create a bunch of shadow processes and tech debt and single points of failure.The corporate dream is executive reporting then driving operational reporting. Except that takes a long time to build, is inefficient and costly to maintain.In reality, we should focus on the operational reporting and push all our resources into helping them be more accurate and automate as many processes there as possible.",

You can always take your model to the cloud later if you wanted to with minimal changes. There is not a ton of value IMO of the paid version. A few other things to consider are that rumors are that Fivetran might be buying dbt, which could affect the future of the OSS option. If dbt continues independently there might be more divergence from their commercial product and OSS, so features you won't have access to (but like I said you switch later).",

This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.This way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings. CDC allows avoiding any changes to the applications themselves and still replicate the data into the destination in an efficient way.",

        "body": "CDC = Change Data Capture. At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.How it’s done depends on the tech. Some databases expose their transaction logs (Postgres logical decoding, MySQL binlog, etc.), and CDC tools read from those. Others use triggers or periodic queries. So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).Compared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time. Event streaming is closer in spirit, but those events are usually app-generated, not DB-level changes. CDC is nice when you want the “truth” from the database itself rather than relying on apps emitting events.",

It is more advanced, but also equally more operation-heavy and hard to understand/debug/optimize.Re CDC attribute-level vs record-level: it is always at a row-level in mainstream databases.",

There's an easy way for the reviewer/UAT resource to review the code and then push it to prod (I guess they would be reviewing the PR in git and approving)? 2. Each persons changes remain separated (in their own branch) until they are reviewed and merged to Prod. For #2, it doesn't work that way for our environment. As soon as a dev tests and passes their code to stage/uat it's in a singular branch. So, if three different devs have merged their code to stage, but only two of their changes have been reviewed by a UAT resource (let's say the 3rd devs code needs to be reviewed by a different UAT resource), we still can't merge the code to prod because there's a pending change in the branch that hasn't been reviewed yet. Make sense?This wouldn't be an issue if the team was smaller. But since this dbt project covers multiple business applications, sometimes one UAT resource approves changes but another hasn't had time to look over remaining code changes in the stage branch.",

        "body": "I've used both in multi-exabyte environments, my thoughts:1. Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)I would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",

Get rid of your CSV‘s and your one big query, that was a horrible idea to begin with. The app can still pass the client ID to the API and government governance can still be insured through whatever tool you’re using on the back end, the AI doesn’t need to know anything about your schema and you don’t have to change your ingest or schema at all.All you have to do is teach your AI about your API, use strict templating to constraint output for pre-rolled reports, and, use a more general template and allow the users to request any report their little hearts desire. The AI will use its knowledge of the API and whip up that report lickety split. You’ll have to think pretty hard about per client query throttling, and make sure that reports can’t be generated that will crush your DB, but doing this sort of thing with graph QL requires this sort of thinking too. This is what you’re talking about, right?If you want to skip the API, you need at least stored procedures so that the AI doesn’t just build its own dynamic SQL. That is a bit scary, but if you constrain access through stored procedures, then you again have control over the way the reports can be constructed with modular, testable composable, functionalized, data access layer components.Log each AI generated report with the actual query it constructs somewhere so you can go figure out what went wrong if something goes wrong. You’ll get a freaking promotion, but it will take a little bit of time and you need to learn more about the different methods of using agents and such, rag, etc.",

If you discovered those endpoints through browser web tools for example, then it's the former, which besides probably breaking the webpage TOS, it is subject to break as those things may change without notice (the same with web crawling). If it's an official API, then it just wasn't designed with bulk data loading in mind.In any case, if you decide to go forward with this you will have to do as you describe: query stuff, cache whatever you can (like product categories which change less often) and create the relationships yourself. So take your time to model *everything*, create proper relationships between entities, build a proper request throttling mechanism for each entity (maybe by using queues) along with a retry mechanism (just check for http error 429 and do exponential backoff for example), write some tests and go with that.A dumb example where let's say the entities are \"product\\_summarized\", \"product\", \"region\", \"category\":1. Take note of the rate limits of each entity to configure the request throttling for your script.2. Query the categories & regions once a day to cache their values. 3. Fetch a list of product\\_summarized using all the combinations of region and category.4. Fetch one product for each product\\_summarized using it's id property.5. Stich up everything together in a main function and run it.Steps 3 & 4 are to be executed under a request throttling mechanism so you don't get rate limited. And if you do, the retry mechanism will resume the operation.Will it be slow? Yeah it will. That's why you need a proper API in the first place.I've been through this a few times and I feel you. It's indeed a PITA.Let me know how it goes :)",

Example uses AWS, but this also works on other cloud providers or on-prem.* **Write side (commands)**: Treat *every unit of work* as a message. One SQS queue for list pages, another for detail fetches. A planner Lambda just enqueues “fetch page X with params Y” messages. Each worker Lambda consumes, respects rate limits via a token bucket in DynamoDB, and writes raw JSON to S3. Everything is idempotent (hash of params/page) so retries don’t hurt.* **Dependencies**: If endpoint B depends on A, you gate it with Step Functions or EventBridge rules. Basically, B’s planner only runs once A’s sync run has emitted a “complete” event. No spaghetti.* **Read side (queries)**: Raw dumps go into S3 (bronze), then batch jobs (Glue/EMR) turn that into Delta/Iceberg tables (silver). From there, Athena/Redshift is your query layer. You never couple ingestion logic with analytics logic.* **Watermarks**: A DynamoDB table stores “last successful sync cursor/updated\\_since” per param set. The planner reads it to only fetch new/changed data.This split means your ingestion system only cares about *moving data in under the rules of the API* (rate limits, pagination, retries, dependencies). Your analytics/consumers only care about *clean queryable tables*.It sounds heavyweight but it’s way saner than endless scripts. Once everything is “a message + an event”, you stop crying over pagination hell.",

Explicit flattening and managing columns yourself; the solution you started with is the most traditional and verbose. Makes most benefit of columnar indexing for performance 2. Making raw data as structs. This has the benefit of displaying as a dictionary (represented close to a nested JSON structure), but you must define a fixed structure (schema on write), thus you lose some flexibility. Performance is expected to be good though, as BigQuery anyway implements this as if they were separate columns behind the scenes, at a physical level.3. Storing a JSON. Even if you use the JSON type, it's still a string. This is not indexed at all, and would be insanely bad for performance without at least some partitioning keys (like the Firebase replicated data naturally has).The choice is yours and depends on your requirements, but I would stay away from #3 if you care about data modeling at all.",

You can materialize a “top-params” view/table and leave the long table for ad hoc or discovery.In dbt, generate the pivot list from a contract file, and run a nightly job that diffs distinct param keys against that contract to flag drift and open a PR. Add tests that fail on uncontracted keys. Avoid storing hot-path params as JSON; use JSON only for edge cases. Cluster the long table by event\\_name, key to cut scans.We’ve paired Segment Protocols for contracts and dbt for models, and used DreamFactory to quickly expose cleaned lookup dims as REST APIs for product teams without building services from scratch.Keep raw nested, model a long table, and selectively pivot only what matters.",

If you’ve locked things into fixed columns, you’ll eventually have to deal with schema drift and painful backfills.That’s why I prefer keeping the materialized layer in JSON. It’s still stored columnar in BigQuery, so you don’t lose efficiency, but you gain flexibility for evolving event structures. Then, if you need “wide” representations for certain use cases, you can always build views on top of the JSON (and even automate those views from your parameters table if you want).One other thing: I’d avoid using a dedicated “parameters table” as the system of record for what keys exist. That approach tends to push business logic into data tables instead of code, and since tables aren’t version-controlled like your dbt models, it makes changes harder to track or roll back.So in short: \\- JSON gives you resilience against schema changes and type mismatches. \\- Views let you expose wide tables when needed, without locking into a brittle schema. \\- Keeping the logic in dbt models (instead of a parameters table) makes it easier to track history and review changes.This way you’re balancing efficiency with long-term maintainability.",

        "body": "Blockchains are decentralized by nature, so there are not many traditional data engineering roles focused directly on them since no one is maintaining central infrastructure. Most opportunities tend to be software engineering roles that work with blockchain protocols themselves.I work as a data engineer for a crypto exchange, and the work is closer to what you would see in a typical tech company. We do very little with raw blockchain data, and when we do it is usually for ad hoc requests. Most of my time is spent on pipelines that help analysts understand user behavior, generate regulatory reports, or improve the exchange and app.Strong domain knowledge will help you stand out. Understanding concepts like order books, makers and takers, wallets, and slippage shows you can apply your skills in context. Solid data engineering fundamentals remain the core of the role. In terms of targets, I would look at exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken), payment gateways (MoonPay), and wallet manufacturers (Ledger).If you want to work directly on blockchain protocols, that is more of a blockchain developer path, which often means joining smaller startups with less structure and support.",

What would be the point of having different \"modes\" if you're writing to the same prod tables? If you're testing in prod you're not actually testing>How many times do you guys test ETL pipelinesMore than zero but less than or equal to the number of times required for me to prove to myself and others that it is working as expectedNow, for the big hurrah: >!&#x200B;!<How do you test ETL pipelines?Case to case. I don't think unit tests apply to data eng/ETL like elsewhere in software engineering. I think you would be really surprised how far you can get with QA when you pick a record in the source, dump it to excel then look at the target and see if it matches the expected behavior (and then repeat for a few records). And then find records in your source that have certain edge cases and confirm your pipeline handled them correctly by looking at the exact records in the target",

I’d document exactly how you pin model versions, cache outputs, and trigger selective recompute when a dependency updates. Also spell out on-disk format (Parquet? chunking for video/audio), partitioning strategy, and how concurrency works with multiple writers. If you can export materialized columns to a lake format and register them in Glue/Unity, folks can still hit them with Trino/DuckDB/Spark without lock-in. Cost guardrails matter: per-function rate limits, daily budgets, and backpressure when queues spike. Finally, surface lineage and metrics (per-function latency, token/cost) so backfills don’t become guesswork.In past projects we combined Dagster for orchestration and LakeFS for data versioning, while DreamFactory exposed the final tables as secure REST APIs for app teams.Nail those details and this can replace a lot of brittle glue.",

For tags, keep low-cardinality: orgid/buildingid, beamid, heightlevel, sensor\\_id; store temp/humidity/battery/rssi as fields. Avoid tags for anything that changes often.Live view: Durable Object broadcasts websocket updates from the latest aggregate point (not raw) at a fixed tick (e.g., 5s) to cap reads. Alerts: compute thresholds in Tasks and persist open/closed state in Cloudflare D1 or KV; you likely don’t need Redis. Long retention: dump raw to R2 daily as Parquet for cheap storage; analyze later with DuckDB/Spark if needed. Exports: precompute daily highs/lows via Tasks and serve from a tiny Postgres/D1 service.I’ve used Grafana and InfluxDB Tasks for rollups; DreamFactory helped expose REST endpoints over Postgres to manage alert state and exports without building a custom API.Bottom line: keep the pipeline lean with Queues, Tasks, and sane tags; precompute what dashboards need and costs stay under control.",

Additive changes are easiest: BigQuery accepts new columns if you enable schema updates, and in Beam you can represent rows as maps or generic `Row` objects instead of hard typed classes. If a column disappears, guard against nulls and missing fields in your transforms. Renames or type changes are trickier, treat them as add + drop and keep a mapping or schema registry to track versions.For API ingestion a simple GCP pattern is: Cloud Scheduler or Cloud Functions to fetch data, push raw payloads into Pub/Sub, run Dataflow for parsing and transforms, and land in BigQuery or GCS. That decouples ingestion from processing and gives you autoscaling and retries.Dataproc is worth using only if you already have Spark/Hadoop jobs or need complex iterative workloads. For most ingestion + transform pipelines, Dataflow is simpler.Schema drift across sources follows the same patterns. For APIs, expect variable JSON and parse dynamically. For files, prefer schema-aware formats like Avro or Parquet, or read CSV headers dynamically. For RDBMS, use CDC tools like Datastream and evolve schemas downstream when columns change.How often do you expect schema changes, and do you need real-time ingestion or is batch good enough? That helps decide how strict to be on schema validation. I work at Estuary, and we handle schema evolution in pipelines without the extra glue code if you want a cleaner option.",

If drift is occasional and daily batch is fine: run Dataflow batch, use Beam Row/generic records, enable BigQuery schema updates for additions, treat renames as add+drop and surface a compatibility view, and do type changes via new column + backfill. Always land raw payloads in GCS (Avro/Parquet) for replay. If drift is frequent and you need low latency: use CDC (Datastream or Debezium) to Pub/Sub, a streaming Dataflow job with a mapping table/versioned schema, dead-letter unknowns, and alerts. For APIs: Cloud Run/Workflows pulls -> Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BigQuery with idempotent MERGE and throttling. Dataproc only if you already have Spark jobs or need libraries Beam can’t handle well. I’ve used Fivetran and Datastream for CDC, and DreamFactory helped when we needed quick REST APIs over legacy DBs without custom glue. Pick strictness and tooling by drift frequency and latency.",

It gives you a clean way to organize pipelines (nodes + catalog + config), great for teams that want testable, modular data workflows. The data catalog abstraction is nice since it supports a bunch of backends, and tools like Kedro-Viz make it easier to reason about your DAGs.The tradeoff is you don’t get connectors or managed ingestion out of the box. You’ll be writing Python to pull from sources, handle schema drift, and deal with APIs or CDC. It’s more of a framework than a platform. For batch work it’s nice, but for streaming or dynamic schemas you’ll end up adding boilerplate. You also need something external like Airflow, Argo, or Prefect for scheduling and monitoring.So it’s great if your team is comfortable with Python and wants long-term maintainability, but not ideal if you’re hoping for plug-and-play ingestion. Do you want more control in code, or are you looking for a managed connector-style setup? That’s the real fork in the road.I work at Estuary, and we’ve focused on the managed ingestion side with schema evolution baked in, so if the Airbyte pain keeps getting worse that could be an easier alternative.",

Wire alerts to Slack/PagerDuty via Airflow/Prefect and report weekly on incidents, MTTD/MTTR, and business impact avoided.For scraping, don’t just test pipeline health-test the data-generating process. Track price volatility bands by route/date, compare against third-party references (e.g., Google Flights/Skyscanner snapshots), segment by IP pool, user agent, and session length to detect “shadow pricing.” Keep a control feed (residential IPs, clean browser profile) and diff against production. Log lineage and sample rows daily for manual spot checks.For AI transforms, keep a golden dataset, define guardrail metrics, and do statistical sampling with clear accept/fail criteria; escalate drift beyond thresholds.We used Monte Carlo for anomaly/lineage, Datafold for diff testing during releases, and DreamFactory to expose stable REST APIs over source DBs so contracts stayed consistent across teams.In short: yes, make it fractional, start small, prove savings, then expand.",

Thank you!From an engineering management perspective, the issue with QA is that if you assign a dedicated person to it, there is an idea that data quality would take a hit, as there is a person now entirely responsible for managing the quality of the data. Engineers just write code; they are not responsible for anything beyond that. But from a management point of view, there is an idea that the person who writes the code is actually responsible for the quality of the results. So, even though I understand SWEs/DEs have a long list of things to focus on and things might slip, having a person dedicated to QA reduces the idea of ownership.Also, the idea about AI is true as well. I think QA was the first industry that took a major hit because of AI.",

It's way more fun, and you learn more as well.My general approach is: using online materials or books, read far enough to learn A Thing, then spend like a week mucking about with that Thing. For instance, you pick up your first book and learn how to do variable assignment, and print, input, and if statements in some language. I would then spend a month writing text games in Python using only those components. And then I would learn about loops and arrays and write a bunch of better games. And then I would learn about writing my own functions and make it better again.",

You can do a lot of low level things and learn a lot about hardware architecture. Most of my suggestions above almost *require* C at times. Maybe that’s your thing maybe it isn’t (it *is* my thing if you can’t tell). Unfortunately school classes are not usually good at helping us find *what* we want to do with programming. Struggling in a class is another thing though and very rough. So I’m sorry you’re going through that. It’s especially hard when it’s something you thought you’d like. Try and see what school resources you have, sometimes they have free support systems for people who want to help struggling students. Sometimes it takes in-person help to really wrap our head around complex subjects. Programming can take shaping your brain to think differently for those who don’t already think like a robot.",

Theory of code is great. It’s nice to understand concepts. But truly understanding code comes from writing it. Seeing the same error and then eventually clicking “oh it’s because I put this here, or oh, I see how to refactor this into less spaghetti”Additionally, while C is a backbone language it is considered low level, and you might benefit from taking what you know and applying it to another language. Some are much easier to learn than others. For example, writing a webpage with basic functions (like say writing a blog post) is significantly easier in my opinion than the majority of things you could build in C. Not only is the syntax easier to understand and master, but you get immediate gratification in seeing what you’re doing as you work and change things. E.g. changing the size of text or a container can be immediately seen when you reload the page or even faster if you use a plugin like Live Server. (Refreshes page every save so you don’t have to manually reload the page). Anyway, my point is don’t fret on not understanding all of the conceptual stuff. Some of it will come in time. There’s still theory far beyond me and I’ve been employed and coding projects for about five years now and again I need to note I didn’t return to college and pick coding back up until my mid twenties. However, I started with Python and then quickly moved into data cleaning with python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Then web development, then swiftUI, and now I actually mostly use react (JS library), and for personal projects a lot of godot so gdscript.",

There's only one way to learn to code: do it!The basics of programming are vocabulary and grammar. You need to know some of that to start. But then you need to use it. If you don't use it, you'll never get it.Take an existing program. Hell, pause one of those videos and write down that program, if you like. Get to run. Now, make it do something different. Loop a few more times, print something different, whatever. Make sure you know what the original did and what the changes you made did.Now, do that again. A lot.I like to code tic tac toe. I've done it a thousand times, still fun. You start with the most basic of things, printing. You quickly realize you might want an array. Then you'll figure out some functions you'll want. And so on.Try that.",

You will have a very wide base of knowledge, just deep enough to know what you actually need to do.The most useful in real life for most people is probably DSA. At university, you will learn way more complex DSA than when you are self taught. (I personally also did multiple advanced DSA courses, because I liked the topic)I implemented a partial merge sort (just the merge step, we had pre-sorted data in our database (as JSON, don't ask)) twice. I had to implement a version of A\\* to run on a huge dataset (which was not in a graph database, it was a mess but worked) and I had to write a maximum-flow-algorithm.I am sure a programmer without prior knowledge could have solved all of these issues, but I already knew how to solve them and what I needed to look up (because I didn't do all that by heart) in advance. That's the real benefit: I know what to look up, and when I need it.Other topics that I know \"enough\" about to gain a massive speed boost, should they become relevant, include how operating systems work, how the network stack works, basically all math that will ever be relevant to me, how compilers/interpreters work, and probably a lot more passive knowledge I forgot about.EDIT: You absolutely CAN learn all of that by yourself, but generally people don't (and it takes quite a while longer without good lecturers, tutors, fellow students, dedicated time and pressure to learn things you don't particularly enjoy)",

CS grads may have more theoretical knowledge but they may not have \"industry-ready\" knowledge such as knowing Git, knowing PostgreSQL, building a rest apt, etc. Autodidacts will have a lot of holes in what they know and without proper fundamental knowledge, they may get stuck.However, this is just a generalization: * Not every CS degree holder are the same. Believe me, I've seen some who, all they did throughout their 4-5 years in college was just coasting, only studying in preparation for an exam but never actually grasped what they've learned. Also, there are CS degree holders, in addition to having solid grasp of the fundamentals, also know important software engineering tools such as git, know multiple languages in depth and software engineering principles.* Not every self-taught programmer just knows basic web dev stuff. Some even learn other languages, some learn in depth. And there are self-taught devs who learn the fundamental knowledge (such as Data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, software design, etc). Any serious developer, regardless of their background, will eventually have to learn the fundamentals if they want to stay relevant, and not just someone learning a new hot technology each month only for it to be deprecated the next month)",

        "body": "So the *biggest* advantage is getting past the HR filter: In most companies, long before anyone with any coding knowledge even glances at your resume, it goes through HR. Let's say they get 2000 applications for an open posting. They need to cut it down to, say, 10 to call in for an interview. If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.Next to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole \"it isn't what you know, it is who you know\" is at least partially true in every field.Okay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.First is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.In addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people \"self-teach\" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.In terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those. The employment angle and the \"actually forcing you to spend the time and effort instead of just convincing yourself you're learning\" parts are the far more important aspects for most people.",

If you can get one, do, if it's not possible, you can still make it, but it will be harder. Everything after is just my opinion, I am self taught, but joined in a much nicer job market, but what worked for me and what all my interviewers talked about was:A) My Github was clean, I followed the basic rules, you don't need green square every day but 3-6 days a week shows you're learning your ass off. Every repo has only one project. Every repo has a README.md that explains what it is, why you built it, how you built it, is it done, where can they see it, and anything else you want. The only repo that breaks these rules is one called \"Practice\" where all your code goes when doing small tutorials, practicing stuff, or just playing around. This folder has a readme that says \"Please Ignore this Repo\" or something so interviewers who check know not to bother. You should also be using proper git branching techniques, create feature branches with good names and good commit messages. Show whoever looks that you know how to work on a team and already know the basics, if you don't know them, learn them. B) My portfolio was nice. I didn't make the standard layer cake design, I also made sure to make it really easy to use, I used very clearly labeled sliding drawers to put all the data they could want on one splash page. I got lots of compliments about it. C) My project was a Recipe app that also included a shopping list and meal planner. Most of the functionality was there, that which wasn't was clearly shown in the readme, the design was terrible as I'm not a designer, but almost every interview talked about it in depth about why I built it, what tech I used, and why. Unfortunately now you also need to get past the AI gatekeepers, this is mostly a \"Stuffing your resume with keywords\" game. If it's in the job ad and you can honestly say you've used it, it should be in your resume and cover letter (if used) somewhere. Don't lie about what you can do, but if your roles have all been Angular, but the ad wants React and you work with React at home sometimes, maybe one of your roles was React...The last thing I'll say that helped me a lot is \"Make a story\". Why are you doing this now instead of earlier. Look at your work history and, true or not, make a story about why you've finally realized Coding is your dream passion, because that's what you need interviewers to believe. You were amazing and doing great but \"lost\", then one day something happened that helped put you on this path to your true dream of becoming a coder. Make a story and build everything around it, your portfolio, your projects, whatever you can, the more the better. Practice answers to the obvious interview questions that explore and explain the story. Humans LOVE stories, especially coherent ones with growth where someone is finally achieving their dream. You need someone to take a chance on you, so you have to appear not to just be the best choice, but to be such an amazing choice that the lack of degree doesn't matter as your code is clean, your github is impeccable, your project shows the knowledge needed, and coding is your dream that you're finally realizing.Sorry for length, you **can** do it, but it will be hard. Even for those with diplomas it can take 6-12 months of looking if they're not lucky... it's VERY much a numbers game though, just keep firing out resumes for any job that asks for less than 5 years of experience and isn't specifically a senior role. If you have any other questions or anything, just message.",

A class bundles data and functions together in a container which starts to matter a lot when you have programs that do many different things​Like if you’re programming a game, you don't want 100 separate sets of data that you have to manually pass into enemy_attack() or enemy_take_damage() functions. It would be a nightmare to track. Instead, you make an enemy class and then you can create 100 independent enemy objects and each one will manage its own health and behavior.",

In fact, the guy who wrote the book on design patterns has since shifted into appreciating functional programming implementations. But remember the principles of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. When you are writing code you know everything about what you’ve written, but you gotta think on the next person who might have to extend or use your code in some way. E.g.: I am implementing some logic where the variable “car_speed” should ONLY change when the operation “accelerate()” is executed. If I had them exposed then an ill advised user (coworker extending my code) might change car_speed directly and break my logic. OOP lets me abstract and encapsulate the logic and values. You have a class. It’s very explicit the values that it is concerned with and it exposes only the things others should be concerned. Then you have inheritance and polymorphism, those have to do with how blocks of logic usually repeat. Ideally you don’t want to copy and paste the same code many times, so it’s nice to have a framework on how the same logic can be repeated slightly differently many times",

A class made the most sense here because I could create a new instance of the class for every submission from the user, sanitize all input, build all the HTML, and do many other tasks, all very easily. If I were to accomplish that without using a class, it would probably involve a lot of spaghetti code and be difficult to understand.

Using AI assist & UI-tools are nice and all, but I think it is useful to know how to write & run \"Hello World\" in whatever language using the a cmd line. Makes reasoning/troubleshooting weird tool behavior _much_ easier.Hardware - learn a _little_ about how hardware _works_ and what assembly language does (I didn't really understand variables, pointers & memory management until I knew a little about assembly).I wish this was around when I started: [https://www.nandgame.com/](https://www.nandgame.com/), if you enjoy playing with that maybe look for a class on \"From Nand To Tetris\".Operating systems - learn about process & resource management. What's different between Windows or Linux or whatever else you might want to use. Learn how a file systems works.Networking - super helpful to know a little about networking (think OSI model). Be able to write a toy client & server program.Virtual environments - maybe see what they're doing over on /r/homelab & look into proxmox.I don't like cloud computing so much because it is very opaque to me and that makes it difficult for me to build mental models of what is really going on.I find I'm a lot more effective and anything when I know some of the foundational things.Lastly, read - when you see the same book mentioned (positively) in several blogs, maybe chase down that book.Happy learning. :-)",

But even that is relative to job title and expected general experience level. Thus *strong* proficiency is that same idea, but better and more knowledgeable. I think for most roles, \"strong proficiency\" implies something beyond simply having existing knowledge and intermediate competency. It means having used a language enough to know many of its ins and outs, and having reasoned opinions about different approaches/methods/etc. which come from prior experience — on top of generally writing quality code. Someone with strong proficiency isn't stumbling their way to *some* working solution — they're choosing wisely from several possible approaches, and making deliberate decisions about *why* they're writing code a particular way. My personal rule of thumb is that someone who can't articulate a personal take on what constitutes \"proficiency\" in a given language is almost certainly *not* highly proficient in that language.",

Why a programmer might chose a linked list, or double linked list over say a binary tree.It's also about showing you ways to store data that are \"Worse\" or bad enough no one would do it so that you are learning the pitfalls about why we don't store data in an unsorted list. Instead when we add an element to the data we insert it in the sorted position to make searching in the future faster.* How to get out of tutorial hell? You just have to enough tutorials to cover: * How to select the correct pancake mix * Shipping it to your home. * How to mix batter * Errors that arise from licking the wisk * How to pour * How to use a spatula without flicking wet batter everywhere. * How to adjust heat on flame or electric stoves.* Once you have all the pieces learned you are leaving tutorial hell. The problem is that when you are in one tutorial, e.g. our spatula example, you aren't even aware of all the other steps that are being \"glossed over\" to teach you just that one aspect. * So you might learn spatula, and then heat, and think Why can't I make pancakes on my own yet! Not realizing there are like 20 more basic tutorial type deals you have to get through just to do that task.* In short I think tutorial hell is a by product of not having a good road map. If you are taking MIT's (Free) Open course-ware. You can look and see how many other courses you have to take to \"Get to the end\" the end being a certain level of education. * But even 4-year degree-ed under grads don't feel like they can step in and do everything. Because they can't. But hopefully they have the tools to lay out and study on their own and create a new plan to teach themselves what they need to accomplish some tasks. * But most of the time they are paired with a \"mentor\" at work that has struggled through the same things. What tools does the company use etc. And that person can give them the roadmap.",

The more elements you have, the longer you search.What if instead we had a tree? struct node { product p; node *left, *right; }; node *root;Imagine if we built this tree of products, where the `root` contained the middle ID product, and `left` contained all values LESS THAN the ID, and the `right` contained all values GREATER THAN the ID. And repeat this rule for every branch of the tree...Well then, for any given ID, starting from the `root`, you've either A) found the product, B) went down the `left` branch, or C) went down the `right` branch. Now as we established, we start with the middle ID, and we divide the inventory in HALF by both sides of the tree.What this means is you immediately determine which half the ID must be contained in, and you have thus cut your search space IN HALF. We don't have to check N elements, we instead check only O\\(log N\\) elements. The more elements you have, the more efficient the search. Each iteration cuts the remaining search field by half, every time.Of course, you get this in: std::map inventory; //... use(inventory[id]);You can go faster still with a hash table.---Most of the job is searching, sorting, and transforming data. How you store the data and the algorithms you write to access that storage are intertwined. In C++, we get a few standard data structures, a few standard algorithms that are common, typical. Using a vector, or a map, or a hash table... It's easy to forget that these are both data structures AND algorithms hidden behind some convenient syntax; but a `map` implements a binary tree, and binary search! All you see is `inventory[id]`, and the rest is taken for granted. The structure and algorithms you use are decided when you are designing your solution, what best fits the problem you're trying to solve.",

You need to understand concepts that simply don’t exist in Python. You need to understand pointers and pointer arithmetic. You need a better understanding of memory management. Stack vs heap. Call by reference vs value. So many more. Sure, Python has its own things like decorators, descriptors, etc, but you can be proficient without a full understanding of them.Expect learning C++ to involve some core concepts, not just language semantics and common libraries.

If you want to really learn a specific IDE, you should think of that as a separate project from learning C.For C, you should focus on the language itself. You can go a long way with no IDE at all. Most programs you write while learning C will be perhaps a few dozen lines long and easily fit in a single source file. You can compile your program with a single command like: gcc program.c -o programThere are of course about a million compiler flags that can change aspects of how the compiler works, what errors and warnings it emits, what architecture to compile for, what files to include, and on and on. Those are good things to know about, but not anything you need to know while you’re learning the fundamentals of C. In short, you seem to want to do everything all at once. **Start with a good book about C.** Work your way through it, doing as many of the exercises as you can. Once you’ve finished that, you’ll be in a better position to decide what you want to learn next — IDE, compiler minutiae, debugging, source control, etc.",

I constantly hit swap in my 16gb ram laptop due to this.You can try a different IDE like Zed, but you still need to run the LSPs and devs servers, and since for some stupid reason JS devs tie their intellisense to their vscode extensions, you will lose a lot of intellisense.It's a deeply stupid world we live in where people thought all of this was a good idea.Edit: forgot to mention that since vscode is Electron, it won't even use your webview process to save ram.

Like they’re twisted together (8 sets, one for each color wire). Every outgoing packet goes to every other host’s Ethernet card, and everyone just ignores packets that aren’t addressed to them. Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.Rather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients. But that’s just an optimization. It does the same *job* as twisting 8 sets of wires together, like the hub was doing. Purely a local-network thing.You can see how this is totally different than inspecting packet headers, consulting routing tables, and forwarding a packet along on its way to who knows where.[I guess that’s a long way of saying that a router routes IP packets on the global network , and a switch “routes” Ethernet packets on the local network.

This isn't talking about some real physical router, **this is talking about the abstract concept of a router's core function**. The network layer is where packets are moved around between separate 'local' network segments.A 'switch' is a layer 2 device, because that core functionality of a 'switch' belongs on the OSI model. Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.Real, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers. A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality. But it will also have a management interface, and often it will have some support for network services like ntp, dhcp, dns, etc, meaning it will operate in layer 4-7.Many of the devices called 'switches' you will have access these days also can operate as routers, have packet filtering and so on. Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch. I could take a random computer and put in a few network interfaces in it, and with Linux turn it into a router, or switch. What something is called is more about what you believe the primary function of the device is.> even though switch comes after router. When looking at the OSI model, you must evaluate it individual for every single device between the source and destination. A computer L1-7 will be often be connected to something acting as a switch L1-2, which will be connected to a router L1-3, which which may be connected to another switch L1-2, which may be connected to another computer L1-7.On a typical wired network you will have some kind of physical connection, your Ethernet frames between nodes are happening at layer 2, the Ethernet frames contain Internet Packets, Internet packets will often be TCP or UDP, Your TCP or UDP packet will often contain some kind of application playload.> Im confused on why the architecture was designed in a way so router have to look into higher layer just for it to encapsulate it again and pass it to lower level device.Though it is mostly used everywhere these days, it is very important to remember, that the world isn't just Ethernet. A router can connect different types of networks. A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.It used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.For people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces. Or maybe you'll could have a DSL connection so you'll have a router with a DSL interface.DSL, DOCSIS, frame relay, fddi, token ring and many more are not Ethernet. They operate differently at layers 1-2.",

Trying to operate at an ethernet (layer 2) level across billions of computers around the world sounds like a bad time. > it feels weird how router is on layer 3 but switch is in layer 2 even though switch comes after router.

Mainly, I think the main issue is that layer 2 can mean a number of different protocols, because there are many different types of networks. Ethernet is what most of us think about and is extremely common in home and business networks. But there are many more. High capacity fiber links, satellite networks, cellular networks, even USB and Bluetooth, all have their own implementations and their own particular way of sending data between devices on those networks. The Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future. The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol. There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not. With IP, as long as devices are able to send an ordered sequence of bytes over a network they can handle IP traffic, and a lot of details necessary for how those bytes are moved in the network are left to the lower layers.",

You still have to decide what patterns make sense in a given situation and how to implement them.But yes, reinventing the wheel almost always gives worse results than using tested and proven solutions, You don't have to repeat the mistakes others have already made and corrected. Still it can help to understand patterns to do your own implementation and see where it fails.On the other end of the spectrum [https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) is always a good resource to understand that overusing design patterns is not always helpful. Sometimes a simple implementation without any patterns is better.It is all about finding the right balance.",

Everything is patterns all the way down, in some sense -- so in another sense, nothing is.Software picked up the notion of patterns from the architecture of physical buildings and places. Here are some examples of \"physical building\" patterns:- Four walls and a roof- A one-sided sloped roof, to deal with a prevailing wind- A two-sided pitched roof, to deal with heavy precipitation- A little space like a porch or hallway, between the public street and the main part of the house, to provide a sense of separation- A cluster of chairs around a window, to allow people to gather near the lightSome patterns are essentially universal. \"Four walls and a roof\" is universal. \"A loop with a counter, an initialisation statement, an end condition, and an increment expression\" (a for loop) is universal.Other patterns are mutually contradictory. There are patterns for building roofs to deal with all sorts of different kinds of weather, but you have to pick one; there are patterns for storing data for financial transactions, for IoT telemetry, for social media -- but you have to pick one.Other patterns are niche, or create some specific effect you might not even want.If you are at the level of experience to ask this question, almost everything you do will have been done by other people enough times that it's possible to talk about a pattern. But that doesn't mean that all of your thinking has to be in terms of assembling patterns. Lots of people make things that are (inevitably) similar to other things, without starting from the idea of reinterpreting those other things.",

That part used to be a lot bigger (with directly programming assembly instructions or managing memory), but it's still there, hidden under layers of compilers that translate your code to stuff the machine can work with.One thing you can do is to flip your mental switch and not treat programming as something goal oriented, but with the mathematicians curiosity of: okay, I have this set of primitives (your language and the idealised computer it runs on) - what can I do with this? What interesting stuff can be found in the set of all possible programs - and how does that change if I use a different idealised machine (for example with an ARM chip vs an x86-64 chip) or with a GPU.",

When working with JavaScript the compiler sees less and less due to no typing which can make runtime errors incredibly annoying to debug on larger projects.Other languages I think are great starts is C or C++ if you want to be forced to understand more about memory, or Java if that’s too difficult and you want to learn about OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It doesn’t really matter much where you start really as long as you don’t stop there, don’t just learn one language, any industry level programmer knows at least 4-5 different languages.

        "body": "A good example to understand this is to compare an `int` and a `float`. On a typical system, these are both 32-bit types. So the declarations `int x;` and `float y;` will both allocate 4 bytes of memory.But the *interpretation* of those bits/bytes is different depending on the type. So the compiler generates different code to work with them.For instance, the 32- bit pattern `00111110000000000000000000000000` represents the numeric value 0.125 when interpreted as a float, or the integer value 1040187392 when interpreted as an int. And if you want to do something like add the bit patterns representing two numbers, the logic for doing that will be totally different depending on whether they're ints or floats.So if you write the statement `x += 1;`, the compiler generates code to load the value of `x`, perform an *integer* addition, and store the value back into `x`. But if you do `y += 1;`, a *floating-point* addition is performed instead. (And the compiler is smart enough to automatically convert the integer constant `1` into the floating-point constant `1.0` so that the types are compatible.)So in general, the purpose of data types is to help the programmer (and the compiler) keep track of how any given chunk of memory is \"supposed\" to be interpreted.",

(Consider the difficulty of moving from 32-byte timestamps to 64-byte timestamps, to avoid a Y2038 problem, if you couldn’t easily distinguish timestamps from the other integer variables at the type level. )",

Every variable in c has an address in memory, and a single address can only hold 8 bits, or 1 byte - so when you declare a variable to be a `char`, the compiler knows that the address for that variable contains all 8 bits of the value, but when you declare a variable to be an `int`, the compiler needs to know that the address only contains one quarter of the 32 bits of the value, and that the remaining 24 bits are stored in the following three addresses.When you create an array of `chars` and try to get the seventh value with `array[6]` the compiler knows that is needs to add 6 to the base-address of the array to get the address of the value, but if the array contained `ints` the compiler would need to add 6\\*4 to the base-address to get the address of the value.If you are up for it, I'd recommend taking a look at the generated assembly code from your C program - for instance with Compiler Explorer at https://godbolt.org/. Try to write small C-programs using different datatypes, and see how the compiled code changes, taking note of the addresses (written as \\[rbp-4\\] or a different number, if you are compiling to x86) - it isn't easy to understand assembly, but you might like it :)",

Your view is very \"C influenced\", and C has a quite impoverished type system -- so you miss an important part of the picture.The type certainly determines how the compiler translates your code into machine code: how much stack space it allocates for the values, which registers it uses for them, which instructions it has to use, ... all these things.And at the level of assembly languages the types are \\*usually\\* (certainly with C in its current form) indeed for the most part erased (there are typed assembly languages and there still are some differences between certain data on common architectures, but generally speaking \"it's all just bytes\").That said: the principal purpose of types is to ensure the \\*correctness\\* of your code. Type systems are essentially logical calculi (in fact typed programs are in a very real sense equivalent to logical proofs), and in writing your code (with types) you build up a logical formula that the compiler then can reason about to some extent (which is ultimately what results in it reserving enough space for your data, using the right instructions etc). There's drastic differences in the \"power\" of those logical systems: with C you're very much on the weak side of things, which means types really are rather \"stupid\". Other languages go far further here, allowing you to encode way more intricate properties via types -- which then for example results in dealing with types that don't have \\*any\\* possible values, or that have values that have no size in memory at all \\[and contrary to what you might initally expect these types turn out to be \\*very\\* useful in practice\\]. (An issue with what you wrote is that `int` is not generally guaranteed to be 4 bytes, but that's more of an issue with C and many introductory resources. If you want to be able to say more about the sizes of your data in memory you'll have to use more specific types like `int32_t`)",

They're binary values to the hardware, but they're whatever you interpret them to be (numbers, characters, something denoting true/false etc.) in your program.At the compiler level they're the primitive building blocks that language creators wanted to provide to users of their programming language, and they have the interface and semantics they define and build into them (e.g. String in Java appears quite different than char \\* in C, despite there being an array of character values somewhere in Java's String implementation).At the language user's level, whatever the language says you have. If it says that int will give you a 4 byte number (for example) then it will.So data types are basically a compiler/interpreter level construct that allows you to represent, store, retrieve, and often mutate, data in your programs. Beyond that it's up to the compiler implementer to define what you write, what you can do with each, what you can't. Often it's not specified how a type is stored underneath, because a programmer may not need to know in certain environments (e.g. browsers).",

It's entirely orthogonal to learning the C++ language, and whatever resource you're using is only including math because it's relevant either to the project they're using to teach, or as broader exemplar code. You can just learn C++ and worry about specific math concepts later when you need to if it's causing you problems.",

Most of courses are on really basic level.

That being said - you have experience, you know how real life programming looks like, you dont need any course, you can grab anything and learn it by yourself - with just documentation.

Once you know the basics, use AI to speed up work (scaffolding, tests, explanations).If you want to learn frontend connection and use AI in development, a practical way is to build a small, deployable app end-to-end. You may or may not follow a course for the app idea. Utilize platforms such as Replit or Lovable or similar, to prototype a frontend for your backend. Those platforms provide code for the generated frontend prototype. Use ChatGPT (or another model) to clarify each generated code block and how it could integrate into your backend application. Write the code(implement it yourself, not copy) in your backend developed application. Reading, running, and editing the code is how you learn. Use AI as an assistant to make your app better. That balance (fundamentals first, AI as an assistant) will make you a faster and stronger developer.",

You'll realize how handy it is to create boilerplate code, which helps you when you're stuck and automates repetitive work, such as documentation. And so on.The point is you'll not only code faster, but you'll be aware of what it does for you, because no two coders are alike. Else you're just vibe coding, and good luck with fixing bugs, creating test cases, securing your software, and adding more features by yourself, etc",

The browser/client/user never has any information that can tel you which is the right answer. Further, like you suggest, there's a very good chance there is no \"ball\" in the implementation and the server is picking whether you win based on chance (if you check the call to the server, it might not even bother saying which cup was clicked).That's not to say that this sort of mistake never happens. There have certainly been failures of this type many, many times before. An example of this sort of failure was in the early 2000s, when the government occasionally redacted PDF files by drawing black boxes over text...but it left the text under the boxes, so when users just deleted the boxes, they could see the text. People goof. But gambling sites are usually careful about this sort of thing. It could be an educational exercise for you to check.",

A lot of the internships advertised around me are hybrid, 2 days in the office and 3 remote. They’re advertised exclusively to college student going to Uni in my city (supporting the local Uni’s). So while there is competition for them it’s a much better chance of securing something. How I got my remote internships:1) I joined the local GDG group (I actually joined the 3 nearest, within a 2 hour drive) and spoke with people nearly any chance I got. Not just about coding but open conversation during intervals or asked what they thought of the talks after. 2) I got lucky and met someone from the same area I’m from, I think it was at a careers event not directly tech focused. He went to school with one of my uncles 20-30 years ago and we had a brief convo about back home. 3) the next time I met him I mentioned it’d be great to just see “What it’s like day to day or the general flow of what devs do? how the online meetings go? What their day is actually like?”. He takes my number and said he’d ask if I could join a meeting with them some time. He’s in management so not directly linked but sat in on some meetings. 4) 2 months mass with no response and out of the blue I get a text asking if I’d like to join an update meeting. 5) from there one of the devs offered to wait on the call and have a chat after. To be honest that’s all I expected to get from it and it was nice just to get that introduction. A week later he offered me some unpaid work just to get a taste of it, I jumped at the opportunity. 6) that was 3 months ago and now they’re on about maybe being able to offer me a paid internship. It wouldn’t be amazing money but roughly equivalent to part time work so I could probably quit my other job and get some real experience. .It’s not easy and I still have another job alongside Uni and the remote work currently. 1) I’m in college 30hr per week. 2) I work 20-30hr per week. 3) and the internship is 16-20hr per weekIt doesn’t give a lot of time off for anything else but ya the experience is invaluable right now. I’d aim for getting directly into a paid hybrid role if at all possible but ya I wouldn’t turn down the Unpaid remote work if it played out that way either. Bit long of a story but hope that helps:grinning_face_with_sweat:",

If you interface with SQL at all, the advantages and quirks will become readily apparent.For a quick tutorial, you can fly through this in a couple of afternoons and likely know enough about Python that it won't be an issue with the ML: [https://open.cs.uwaterloo.ca/python-from-scratch/](https://open.cs.uwaterloo.ca/python-from-scratch/)This spends a lot of time explaining CS as well, so someone might have a better intro for an experienced programmer.

If you're a pleb like me, odds are you'll forget about many of those things without practical application.  Building stuff would be that application, no? The knowledge you're learning now will always be freely accessible on the internet. Those recourses may even be better than your current curriculum. Your time, however, is limited. Try to cut back a little on the study time and allow for 30min or so of project time a day. Don't stress about perfect grades unless you...only want to pursue academia? Your perfect score, while impressive, is only a small aspect towards your overall growth as a programmer. Why focus *all* of your attention on that?.With that said, you're already doing great and are probably farther along than I am with a fraction of the time. As long as you keep your passion and curiosity, it doesn't matter how inefficient your process is or how dumb you think you are.

It's short hand for '\\*(pointer).item'But tbh, this doesn't look like a pointer issue on your part. Like, the code wouldn't change much if this were C++ code using a class or something. This code is pretty clear, so this is a comprehension issue, and I'm hoping you at least got told how a queue works before you got the slides.If you know what a Queue is, what's going on here is that your prof has defined a few functions that take a Queue pointer as input, and didn't tell you how they work yet. The prof has also defined a Queue struct, and hasn't told you how that was implemented either. Odds are, your prof intended you to read this and interpret it kinda like pseudo code. Or you didn't read far enough in his lecture slides to find the rest of the info. Either way, read the whole set of slides before jumping to conclusions.The Queue struct would seem to be implemented using an array. My guess is it probably looks something like this: typedef struct { int back = 0; // index of the last item in the array 'Datatype' val[CAPACITY]; // where we store everything in the queue. Can be of any type. } Queue;Then there's the functions he defined. In order:* int length(Queue q\\*) : Tells you how many things are stored in the array. Likely derived from Queue.back's index. * int isEmpty(Queue q\\*) : Tells you if length is 0. Either way, point remains: Ask your prof. This is what office hours are for. Or e-mail them.",

In Python this looks like this: `if __name__==\"__main__\":` In this way your code will only execute if you actually run the file, not if you import it. 3. I like that you commented everything pretty well. Your comments are not very detailed, but they give me a good idea what a codeblock should do very quickly. 3.5. As a tip for comments: Use docstrings [https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) In many IDEs docstrings show up when you hover over a function, do quickly tell you what it does. 4. In line 150, I would suggest using an object, or a dictionary to store the data, since it's closely related to each other. There will never be a case, where you want to keep the vitals of the old patient, but generate a new name for example. This could be done like this: class Patient(): \"\"\" represents Patient data\"\"\" def __init__(self, name, id, status, vitals, dialogue, is_expected): self.name = name self.id = id [...] [...] type_out(f\"Patient Name: {patient.name}\") You already seem to use a smaller version of this as a dictionary in `generate_expected_patient_list()`, so I think unifying both datastructure would be a good idea, especially if you want to develop this game further. 4.5: You also seem to use the exact same line of code `type_out(f\"Name: {p['name']}, ID: {p['id']}\")`quite a few times. This could be rolled into the class I suggested above, giving Patient a method to type\\_out their name and id. You would then use it in code as `patient.type_out()` for example. All in all your code is structured okay, but for better readability you could thinnk about moving the actions and the new\\_day part of your loop into their own functions. This might not look like a benefit in your codebase right now, but if your game logic gets bigger, like a few thousand lines of code bigger, your game loop really should look roughly like this: while True: new_patient = get_new_patient() action = get_player_action() handle_action(action) check_game_over(strikes) check_new_day(expected_patients)Anyways, good job for a beginner :) Keep it up!",

Many high-performance ECS systems represent entities as an Integer and map that to the set of components.I’m not sure if this is incidental or an intentional feature, but ECS can have components added and removed on the fly at runtime, and there’s not a huge amount of scenarios where that’s a requirement(plugin systems), and there are at least some where it’s an anti-pattern.

Keep components as plain data and systems as stateless functions. Batch adds/removes, avoid per-entity allocation, and use versioned IDs to prevent stale references. Start small: convert projectiles or NPC vision to an ECS-style loop and measure. For engines: archetype ECS (DOTS, Bevy, Flecs) is great for dense queries; sparse-set (EnTT) tolerates high churn. On “render-bound” games: servers and complex sims are often CPU-bound, so ECS helps there.AWS GameLift and Redis handled sessions and state for me, and DreamFactory generated REST APIs over Postgres for ops dashboards and tooling without me hand-rolling controllers.Bottom line: use ECS where data-parallel hotspots justify it, mix simpler patterns everywhere else.",

In University, they make you print these pyramids from ***********. Do that! Create triangle from the *******. Then square! Then chess board pattern. Nothing too complicated. And you gonna feel that this is silly, and who is ever going to need stuff like that? Well, I have seen websites that use these star patterns in a really unique way, and it looks awesome!

It's a valid criticism. I don't understand how you can say that it's a valid criticism, and still think they didn't know what they were talking about.> Flash had a lot of vulnerabilities because it gave freedom to the software engineer. Freedom which could be abused.The point of something like Flash is to run code from external third-party sources, which are by definition potentially untrustworthy. Abuse prevention is part of the bare minimum requirements.If I go to a website, and a plugin automatically loads some content, and the plugin gives too much \"freedom\" to **some other developer's** code to do what it wants with **my** computer, then the plugin is not fit for purpose.Modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox have put a lot of work into sandboxing HTML/JS code so that it can run *safely* even if the code is untrustworthy. Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much \"freedom\" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.The difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture. Macromedia/Adobe *could* have put as much careful work into sandboxing as the browser developers did. And then they would have had an equally high-quality, secure system. But they didn't, and that's why their product sucked.",

Doesn't matter whether I'm installing cable from the telephone pole, cleaning toilets, coding scheduling apps for sports venues.I still love coding flash/animate/air though. Been exclusively in C# now for 4 or 5 years. My impression is that Adobe did a friggin amazing job of the rework from AS2 to AS3, but that was another nail in the coffin, because all the old AS2 programs could not be converted. I coded some things to convert from AS2 to AS3 and it was a nightmare.(C# seems to suffer from the problem AS2 had where there was not enough uniformity with web service calls and event handler delegates.)Adobe Flash through AIR did work on the iPad as an app, so it did have its little security sandbox there. It had terrible performance on the iPad 1, but it was totally fixed on the iPad 2. I made many apps with it including a 10 point touch app that was on a floor to ceiling monitor where multiple people could interact with it. A heart rate monitor app in a fitness studio with time synced looping video on 16+ iPads displaying the composite heart rates on a 70\" screen all timed with music programs that the owners made on the server.I made about $100,000 from that job. So, not good at man negotiating. I'm a trans woman and my masculine behaving first wife was the only female in the 18 piece Memphis Jazz Orchestra. She would sit on my left playing bass trombone and the amazing leader trombonist on my right. We made $25-$50 a night playing on Beale St.That scheduling app was about a $100,000 thing too. Yes, security would have been an ongoing thing with it. That StripeJS implementation seems like it changes every 5 months and my career was certainly going in a direction where I wouldn't be around forever to maintain it. My doctors tend to retire too.Also coded a CNC machine. Arduino, stepper motors, pump switch, scale. Used a wireless Adobe AIR tablet to calibrate and control it. Made less than $20,000 on that gig.Also a js audio podcast recorder/editor for less than $10,000. I could never find anyone to handle the negotiating end of it. What is the trade? Where is work in the world headed? Do we need more hydro electric more than new software?Have you called your electric provider and asked them how the grid would handle increasing backflow from solar panels? I did back in like 2014.Q: Can you cook a steak with a solar panel without the grid, a battery or a flux capacitor?",

The problem was I couldn't get any more gigs using it. And then, just like with Apple, I got frustrated with all the subscription fees I was paying for a software that I considered to be end state mature software. Since I couldn't make money with it anymore, it became a hobby, so I became interested in actually coding a clone of Flash itself. It's certainly too much work for one person to do, but I enjoy it as a hobby activity. It keeps my mind creative and in the software engineering mindset.So my C# WinForms projects are a blog tool with a PHP to HTML compiler and image resizing features, a picture viewing and snipping app, a camera app and a hard disc music recording app. I also have a web scraper tool I made a year ago.I had started the flash clone project a year and a half ago before I sold my house and lost the computer and code. It had an MDI (multiple document interface) like web browsers or Photoshop. Now my picture viewing tool has a paste into new app instance option and a paste in place option. There is a bug in the drag after paste in place right now and I'll get around to that in a few months.Oh yeah, that clone had an action history that I coded for an unlimited undo and redo feature. First time I coded such a thing and it was working great! I used a List object and model to save the data and accessed it with LINQ. Then saved it to a file using Newtonsoft. I did some fancy C# Reflection work professionally at my last job. Multithreading too.I made a tweener in Objective C in 2011 that was multithreaded. Remember @synchronized?",

Java will run on desktop and natively on any Android device. Python has frameworks and tools that will also allow you to do it. If it’s a web app like browser base JavaScript can get it going. My advice pick something you’d like to do with plenty of tutorials and find a language that matches it. Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. After you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. Personal recommendation:If you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. If you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. I like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. JavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted. It will run on any browser but I’ve only done the bare minimum when I’ve had to use it. Most importantly check back in 2 years when I’ll be advising you that JS is the only way to go, after getting out of bed on the other side or something. But really getting a start on any of them and sticking out the hard parts is the way to go. C/C# for .Net or Java take your pick.",

I think the hard part learning C++ is that it’s a huge language that, as I said, have changed a lot during its lifetime so it’s programming style have changed every 5 years or so, so it’s a moving target and will take time to catch up and keep up (Even Scott Meyers gave up).",

It's mostly about what kind of job you want.In general:* Python -> Data Science, AI application, Web Backend, Automation* C#/Java -> Desktop and mobile dev, game dev, Web Backend* JavaScript -> WebFrontend, Mobile Frontend (Technically Web Backend, but everytime I see that, it's a mess, so... I suggest you don't)* C++ -> low level stuff* PHP -> Web BackendThere are a lot of other languages, but in my experience, those are pretty common examples. So yeah, Python is a good choice, if you are interested in one of it's applications.Video game modding is heavily dependent on the game. You can probably, technically, mod any game you want in C... but that's beside the point. Most games have a modding API, either officially, or inofficially. Most often, those APIs are meant to be used in the same language as the game was written and/or scripted in. C++ is the most common, as most major enginges are written in C++ under the hood. C# works for Unity modding, iirc, and some smaller game engines use lua or GdScript (Godot specifically).So, in both cases, freelancing and modding:It's not about one language being better than all others. That's just not how it works. That's like saying \"The saw is the best tool ever!\" and then attempting to drive a nail into wood using it. If you want to do a job, there are tools that are better suited for that specific job. But, as I said above: If you really want to, you can probbaly mod any game using C (after copious and unnecessary amounts of reverse engineering), just as you COULD use C for Data Science, Web Frontends (WASM), App Development, Automation, etc. It's just not the most ergonomic tool to use, and that's understating it.EDIT: Also, don't fall into the wrong assumption most people have, that programming languages are hard to learn. They are in fact, not. If I (or any developer with only a little experience) want to learn a new language today, it will literally take me a weekend. They all pretty much work the same, and once you understand all key concepts, you can switch langauges as you please. Sure, the tooling will be unfamiliar, and some conventions will be too, and you will take a little longer to get into a groove, and the first few weeks your code quality might suffer a little, but it's really not hard. The reasons most people assume it's hard (I think), is because they think it will be like learning their first programming language(s). When in reality, the first langueage(s) you are learning are not hard, because languages are inherently hard to learn; It's because you are learning to program. And programming is hard. It's problem solving, a lot of theory and background knowledge. You can spend multiple lifetimes learning non stop, and still not know everything there is to know.",

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goalSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.Once you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the \"vernacular\"** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.Oftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not \"tutorial hell\".People who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",

I don't know how to find the in-between of software architecture, at the very least for specific fields such as data science or game programming. game design wasn't quite the word, and when I tried to google 'software architecture in 2d games' and ended up overwhelmed with the concepts of solid state machines and other topics that still didn't quite meet me halfway. I thought it was enough to just try to define an idea, break it down into specific pseudocode steps as much as I could then begin googling, but without underlying software design principles my pseudocode steps are often still gibberish, at least to the extent of googling, and asking specific questions for a project is a faux pas because I should be able to find analogous questions asked prior, but if I had the vocabulary to do that I would not be asking my niche, amateurish question.",

Use a secure, unique password, with 2FA if possible. Don't fall for phishing attacks that seem like they're coming from your registrar but aren't really.The other is the privacy of your registration information. ICANN requires that all domains have valid contact information, including a mailing address, and that information is made public through the \"Whois\" database system. If you don't want your details to be public, you may want to use whatever privacy forwarding service that your registrar provides. (If you just provide fake info, it's possible that you'll lose access to the domain when the contact info can't be validated.)----Everything else depends not on the domain itself, but what server you're pointing its DNS records at.If you're using a static file host such as GitHub Pages, then there's not much to be concerned with. Any attacks would go to GitHub's servers, not yours, and there's not much risk of a security problem affecting your data specifically. All you really have to worry about is inadvertently publishing information that you want to keep private, but that's true of literally any digital communications.If you were to have your own webapp running on your own server, then you would have to be a lot more careful with security, but that's true whether or not there's a domain name pointing to your server.",

But if you look at the above list and want to emphasize that 1, 2, and 3 are discrete acceptable values and everything else is a reject, then a switch-case might be a good alternative to express this idea \"in code\": switch(X) { case 1: case 2: case 3: // TODO: Add acceptance code here. break; default: // TODO: Add rejection code here. break; }However, some programmers, especially new ones, find the switch-case difficult for various reasons (usually due to the \"fall through\" rule), but once you get used to them they are pretty handy.",

As another, it becomes harder to reuse class A in some other project without also pulling in class B, even if the new project doesn't need it.That's why it's considered a good practice to try to use interfaces to avoid direct dependencies.",

Using interfaces to obscure the dependency doesn't change the fact that you do have this dependecy. Purists will maybe tell you that such a tight coupling between classes is a problem with your architecture, but it's hard to judge without seeing the actual code.

If it is a relatively simple CRUD application then it does not need microservices. If it has distinct independent parts that function separately from each other and serve a specific purpose, then you can consider building microservices. You can go first with multimodal monolith and see how it works out. If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.You can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. MQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.gRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).In terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.There is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it. With multiple microservices/monoliths and/or multimodal monolith, you are also likely to encounter either some of the MQ tools or Kafka. But as I said, use it in your project when it makes sense to use it. Do not just drop any and all kinds of technologies into your project. It will be an unnecessary technical bloat. Your client will not pay you for stuff that serves no actual purpose (sometimes he is not willing to pay even for meaningful things/upgrades).",

        "body": "> why do we have to create an object in main to reach classes?A class definition only defines a type. Let's look at an example: class weight: std::tuple { static bool valid(const int &value) { return value >= 0; } static int validate(const int &value) { if(!valid(value)) { throw std::invalid_argument{\"value cannot be negative\"}; } return value; } friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &os, const weight &w) { return os (w); } friend class weight_extractor; public: weight() = delete; explicit weight(const int &i): std::tuple{validate(i)} {} weight(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight(weight &&) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(weight &&) noexcept = default; auto operator (const weight &) const noexcept = default; weight &operator +=(const weight &w) noexcept { std::get(*this) += std::get(w); return *this; } weight &operator *=(const int &i) { std::get(*this) *= validate(i); return *this; } explicit operator int() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } explicit operator const int &() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight) == sizeof(int)); static_assert(alignof(weight) == alignof(int));This only tells us what a `weight` IS. It gives us the semantics of a `weight`. The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`. class weight_extractor: std::variant { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) { if(is.tie()) { *is.tie() << \"Enter a weight: \"; } if(int v; is >> v) { try { we = weight{v}; } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) { is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit); if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) { throw; } } } return is; } friend std::istream_iterator; weight_extractor() noexcept = default; public: weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete; operator weight() const { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight)); static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));The semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.The `weight_extractor` is an example of \"encapsulation\", aka \"complexity hiding\" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. \"Data hiding\" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding. weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept { return l += r; } int main() { weight my_fat_ass(190);See? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too. if(std::input_iterator iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) { weight your_fat_ass = *iter;You will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value. auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass; std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << \"lbs.\\n\"; } return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE; }In C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.So to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",

If you're using C++ in an object oriented way, the memory for those objects will need to be allocated somewhere. There are different storage durations (e.g. static, dynamic, automatic) which define how long the memory lives (e.g. entire program, custom lifetime, life of stack frame, respectively).

You can't really roll back since you can't really be sure the build is reproducible. Your server is doing multiple things, not running stable artifacts. So obviously your setup isn't really something that would be used in production/professional settings. But if it's enough for you that let's say once a day your server might be updated with new code assuming there is something new in the repo, the cronjob doesn't fail etc. then cronjob keeps it simple, so why not if some or none of the concerns with the setup really matter to you. I'd probably at least consider doing it properly, for experience and learning purposes if nothing else. But if that's not something you are interested in, do it quick and dirty with cron.",

Automation here should be about making deployments a push-button exercise, not actually automatic. You want merges to a (often protected) master/main branch (or whatever) to kick off builds (of containers), tests, etc, but stop right before touching your actual deployment. If everything is good, you push the button. The cron job idea is a recipe for disaster in real environments.>I just want to `git pull` and `docker compose up --build` when I cut a new release.There's nothing wrong with just doing this manually via ssh. You can script it via ssh too so that it's a one-liner. Or have a GH Actions flow do it when you manually run a flow. Usually you'd have automations (pipelines) build your images and put them in a registry, then deployment automation can pull them from there to get containers.",

That said, if this is a production project, it will eventually be a good idea to run tests before deploying and proper workflows will scale to that more easily than an ad-hoc script.I would not recommend the cron approach, because it bundles multiple changes together into a single unmonitored deploy. Usually people will either do continuous deployment, where every merged commit is automatically verified and then deployed immediately, or they will do manual deployments where post-release validation can be performed. Opinions differ, but I’m in the camp that says continuous deployment is better if you have the level of automated testing and monitoring needed to make it safe. Deploying one change at a time makes it easier to determine what caused breakage when it occurs.With a cron job deployment you’d get the worst of both worlds. A bunch of changes would bet bundled together, making error tracing harder. You probably won’t be verifying the deployment after it occurs, because it’s on a schedule. And it won’t be immediately clear what changes are deployed or not at any given point in time, which can be very frustrating in practice.",

I might have been misreading a lot of articles assuming that artifacts were things like logs or intermediate files, things produced by production instead of the production code itself.But if I should be deploying the images themselves, then Github having its own VM to do that building makes more sense. Then I assume there's some signal that Github sends to the production environment telling it to update its version of the image?Like you might have surmised, I'm building this on my own, mostly just trying to get in the habit and skills of best practices. Even if it isn't necessary right now, I'd rather not have to learn on the fly later.",

I've found that keeping changes small and iterative matches my style very well.What another commenter pointed out is that I should be deploying images to my production environment, rather than sending the whole repo and building it on-site. That also makes github workflows make more sense, using a VM to build an image.",

I spend easily over 50% of my time programming over pens and papers, not the computer. And the rest of that 50% isn't even all spent typing. If you really want to optimize typing speed though, I would forego both layouts and go for a programming-specific one. There are layouts that put all important characters on the home row with modifiers (brackets, semicolons, etc.) It's even more comfortable to type than the US layout. I never did more than play around with that though, because IMO, it's really not that big a deal.",

WebKit gets around 40 commits a day currently, so if you start working on WebKit and it takes you a month to get something working, by the time you're done WebKit will have had 1000 commits and you'll probably have to fix a bunch of things to catch up.I just saw that you're aware of the WinCairo fork that provides MiniBrowser. I'm afraid that's all you're going to find. I thought you wanted to build your own browser? If so, MiniBrowser is a perfect place to start - a working bare-bones browser with a clean slate so you can build whatever you want on top of it.If you want a complete browser with modern features to extend and modify, that doesn't exist on Windows based on WebKit right now, as far as I know.",

Or at least buy the special apps that can limit your use of the apps on your phone, but given you can code maybe you'll get around them.My advice is start programming small games. There are a few good ones that also use visual programming based on javascript. Don't use a 3d engine, too much fiddling around to get anything done. This will help with your programming skills in javascript which is arguably the top language for dev work right now.Other sensible stuff would be to cut the caffeine entirely or only twice a week when you really need it. (anymore and you build a tolerance for it). As you seem hyperactive. Try to wakeup real early in the morning and start coding then, when noone is around to distract you. Another is to use the app cold turkey micromanager to block any apps that might distract you from coding, they also have a website blocker too. Another thing is try to avoid artificial ingredients like in fruit loops, they can effect your mood. Try go on a more natural diet, no processed foods. For example if you like coco pops, just buy rice crisps and put natural cocoa and sugar in the milk, less dodgy ingredients.On youtube there's this video called dopamine addiction. Basically save your fun activities or dopamine hits/highs for the end of the day, that way your brain becomes addicted to work since it expects a payoff at the end of the day. This would include things like sugar, so try to switch to artificial sweetener/or combo of sweeteners as they taste better. Sugar gives you a mind/body energy rush/dopamine hit, you want to avoid. And of course start practicing pomodoro timer stuff. I have two digital watches on my hands. I turn on the stopwatch on one when i study, stop studying before 50min but no less than 25min and put the timer of 10 min break on my other watch. According to studies this has been found out to be the optimum productivity work schedule.",

Now, once you do that, I'll let you in on a secret. I also started programming young, and I'm more than three times your age, and my project graveyard is more vast than you could imagine. Not every project gets worked to completion. Not every one needs to. Sometimes you learn enough and just move on, or sometimes something more interesting or important comes up. Honestly that's perfectly okay. Now it's not normal for you to lose interest after a few minutes. Usually it should be weeks at least before something else comes up.

If by \"I\" you mean to say \"Should everyone learn compiler construction/design\", I'd say, not everyone should (assuming they know programming).If you're a beginning programmer, then compiler theory can be pretty dry and a little complicated. If you were majoring in computer science in the US, then this would typically be a 3rd or 4th year course (a CS degree usually takes 4 years to complete in the US), and even then, it's often not required and some majors avoid it because it has a reputation for being hard.Having said that, if you're curious how compilers work then writing a toy compiler (follow a tutorial) can be helpful. You probably won't have the time to build anything beside a compiler for a very simple language. I'd recommend writing an interpreter over a compiler. The techniques are pretty similar, but doesn't require drilling down to assembly code.Do a web search for `Ruslan Spivak interpreter Python`. He has a tutorial for a simple calculator written in Python, then an interpreter for a simplified Pascal programming language (an older language).",

Tech was the only industry where new grads could make six figures right out of college. The comparison with biology is also dumb; I came from that industry, and while unemployment may be low, _underemployment_ is sky high. I’ve seen PhDs spend their entire careers as postdocs and lab techs making five- or (at best) low-six-figure salaries. I’m making more in tech right now than I could have dreamed of in molecular biology.One more thing; the NYT has, ever since Cambridge Analytica, taken a stridently anti-tech narrative slant, to the point of sometimes distorting things.

All the work has moved up an abstraction layer, so to speak.- There is a huge skill differential between programmers, and people were erroneously claiming that anyone who could fizzbuzz or write a select statement could get a job, even though this hasn't been true for years. You actually need to be pretty good and be ready to hit the ground running to consistently find work these days.Anyways, all the students that have graduated from CS programs or bootcamps over the past couple years, or will graduate in the near future, are preparing for jobs that no longer exist and aren't coming back. Tech will continue to flourish as a sector, but unless you are a real gold star candidate (right connections, right school, highly technically capable, etc.) the path is only going to become more bleak for individual developers, and if you're just starting in the industry, it'd be wise to get out now.",

People were being paid to write simple code that business people found magical and now the bubble has popped. At my company, we had code from mid 2010s that was something a 6 month bootcamp grad could write better, but it was done by a long time employee with a CS degree (so please don't use that as an excuse). This guy is considered a highly experienced person at our company, but he writes atrocious code. Even dumbasses were getting hired and to the business person it looked like complicated magic. A lot of bad workers got easy jobs. Sorry you missed out. That's the truth of it. Now that shit doesn't cut it and isn't even necessary with some of the low level stuff being easily automated with AI.The problem is that you can't truly differentiate yourself from the really stupid Cs get degrees type of CS student (and with grade inflation so big now at places like Ass State University, even poor programmers can be a 4.0 grad). Everyone has the same resources and the expectations at interviews have become ridiculous. There are easier ways of making a living (trades, nursing, accounting).",

This post is not saying \"all young kids suck\", but rather explaining how so many people completely unable to do any CS work are getting degrees. They aren't slipping through the cracks, admins chiseled out a crack and swept them towards it.By the way, those great students? To a T, all of them were eager and hard working. Not all of them were obvious geniuses - they just worked really hard on a lot of things because of the love of the craft.---College CS professor here.In the last 10 years, we've seen an absurd increase in the amount of pressure put on us to just pass students by admins chasing retention and graduation statistics. I had a student who literally never showed up to either of my two classes he enrolled in a semester, never turned in a single assignment.So I failed him. So he filed a civil rights complaint. I then had to spend a total of roughly 60 hours defending myself from this, having meetings, collecting every email I ever had with the student and their advisors (plural), recalling dates of the two conversations we had, and rebutting outright laughably obvious lies like the student claiming that I locked them in my office and said they weren't allowed to leave until they did their work (the student didn't even know where my office was) - work that was never completed and he couldn't produce.More than a few professors, would I relay these stories, tell me , \"just don't fight these battles, give them what they want\". Which is even more frustrating because it means when those professor students get into my class, they can't write a for loop by themselves in an advanced software design class.Also, (noting I'm teaching faculty and not research faculty), teaching evaluation is almost entirely boiled down to student evaluations and student evaluations are negatively correlated with the difficulty of the final exam. And let me tell you, they put no effort into this analysis. They just look at in a 30 question survey, the average of one question. And my 700 person undergraduate class is treated as apples to apples to a 12-person grad level research team course. They only look at above average or below average, nothing else. So, your incentivized to make the class as easy as possible so the students give you five stars. It is the yelpification of America, and it creates the worst possible incentives. Like, my student evals can average to 4.1 out of 5, But the average for the entire department is 4.3, so therefore I'm a bad teacher. My average being brought down by a very large number of one-star reviews from shock of all shocks people failing the class.So we've created an entire incentive structure where students seek out the easiest classes they can to get the piece of paper that says they're entitled to a job, and faculty are pushed towards making those classes as easy as possible rather than actually teaching, and anyone who bucks that trend will have an admin ride their ass at the end of every semester because their student evaluation score is .02 less than last year, and \" maybe you could try bringing cookies to class\" (serious suggestion made by someone with a six-figure salary)Basically, goodhart's law remains undefeated.",

If you’ve been working in technology for long time you’ve been exposed to lots of things, lots of languages, lots of libraries, lots of methodologies, etc. and then you zoom in on one very, admittedly simple thing like basic understandings of JS for someone who has been working in JS or any arbitrary simple thing that isn’t necessarily cross cutting between technology implementations.On the surface that seems simple: why doesn’t this person understand this thing when they’re working in that space? In reality, you’re looking at it from a biased view. You have a huge repository of internal knowledge and experience. Meanwhile on the daily basis, they may be doing their best to understand baseline assumptions across dozens of technologies and implementations they’ve never been exposed to. Things you take for granted likely, maybe they need to deal with managing certificates, or connecting to a remote Linux system, or something else. Everyone’s going to have varied levels of exposure over their education and careers to certain things. There’s a good chance they have a *firehose* of things they’re trying to understand that they’ve never dealt with before.In addition to that, if you’ve been in tech for say 15+ years or longer, software wasn’t a huge space the further you go back.

Fast forward today and there’s all sorts of HTTP server implementations, but during that period of time simply knowing Apaches HTTPd server in and out gave you baseline knowledge almost anywhere you went, which was learned experience, so new problems you had in that work environment could get more focus vs having to understand a layer of some service on-top of understanding the actual unique problem at the workspace (I’m just using this as an example, there are lots of domains where some almost monopolistic technology reigned supreme, and things didn’t shift that often).Today I can think of probably a dozen popular implementations out there people use, sometimes even library based services, SaaS options, so on just for HTTP hosting, all of which with all their own little idiosyncrasies and domain specific knowledge around them. Again this shift is true in many (most?) technology spaces (e.g. databases, etc.). Software variety and knowledge surrounding those popular concrete implementations has exploded.As a result, all sorts of businesses out there are likely to use some unique mixture of “base” (to them) services “the whole world should understand.” Someone experienced these days may even struggle shifting between environments because of variation in tech. You know some things, but there’s some variety of tech you simply have to learn, in addition to doing your actual job, which isn’t accounted for, it’s just assumed you know it. It’s a very common bias in tech I’ve seen.If you’ve also been working a long time you’re picked up a lot of these things and expanded your pool of knowledge. You’ve seen and used several database systems and services, you’ve seen and used several http servers, front end libraries, so on. You had the benefit, to some degree, of watching these things grow in popularity and catching up as they became popular. None the less, it’s not possible to know all these systems anymore due to the growth rate of tech implementations. So even experienced engineers have issues with these now.I see this bias often with people who tend to work in one or two technology spaces and have the luxury of garnering deep understanding of something. You tend to forget that things that come “simple” or should be “basic” to you aren’t inherently as simple or basic to other people. These kids have little to no experience and are jumping in a pool that doesn’t have good discrete skill specialization (software engineers should be broken up into multiple disciplines when you consider the range of knowledge assumptions, in my opinion).So all this is to say, give the kids a break. It’s like they just finished med school and are applying for open medical speciality positions ranging from cardiologist, to neurosurgeon, to dentist, etc. and being judged as if they had “base” specialized knowledge and experience around each profession yet they have to apply to all of them just to attempt to get employed and hope for the best. It’s especially true in today’s market where you cast a wide net (they’re applying to anything and everything, they need to eat). Thankfully medicine isn’t like that or your dentist may be like “oh I usually do hearts but let’s get this root canal underway, should be similar, veins n such!” Maybe all their past experience was on embedded systems work and all of the sudden, they need money to eat, so they’re now doing their very best to do React frontend work. In software businesses do this in an attempt to reduce labor costs (there’s also practical reasons specializing doesn’t work, your specialty may be dead in a year) and because the impact usually isn’t someone’s life… it’s some not so life threatening feature or service being unavailable, so whatever. But the challenge is somewhat similar (obviously in software we’re more tolerant of failure to some degree).",

That's how that whole shtick works.Someone like a fashion influencer can just follow the fashion trends. There will *always* be people obsessing over buying fashion, and as a result, there will *always* be companies desperate to sell fashion. That industry doesn't die. It just changes forms.Leading up to the pandemic, and especially during the pandemic, there was a ***huge*** audience that wanted to buy the idea of being a SWE. Make $500k, chill around the office playing ping pong 90% of your time, etc. An easy way to riches.So the audience was there. And the people paying influencers to influence that audience were also there. The US government was desperate for people to major in CS/STEM, the universities were thrilled that everyone and their mother wanted a degree now, the big tech companies wanted more talent to hire, everyone was tyring to cash in.Post-pandemic, when the market crashed.... none of that demand exists any more. The audience has noticed a CS degree isn't quite what was originally sold to them. The government doesn't want to shove more people into a degree with a high unemployment rate, and the big tech companies have an enormous pool of talent to choose from now, and Universities *really* don't want a bunch of people going to their college to end up unemployed and kill their numbers.That *idea* of being a cushy-SWE has dried up. Unlike something like fashion, it's not forever. It had an end. And we hit it.There's simply no more money in being a SWE influencer.",

I work in management, and I'm pretty good at it, but I feel the same stress you do from time to time. Management roles can be challenging to find, and no job in tech lasts forever. I make sure to take on a ticket or two every sprint, but the reality is that I'll never be able to keep up with the senior developers on my team, who do most of the heavy lifting on every project. Development and management are different jobs. Everything is trade-offs. If your company needs you to be a manager or a Product Manager, they should give you that title so you can include it on your resume. If not, or if you want to stay on a technical track, then you should focus more on development work.",

And this SUCKS late-game.Whereas with good old code, you'll hit the limit of your own knowledge and creativity far earlier than any actual tech constraints.What I would personally consider \"the basics\" for hard-skills are standard computer skills, knowing how to find answers, programming principles, one programming language (if possible JS), HTML, CSS, Git, at least some Bash, and not being afraid of Linux. These are the core skills of a web programmer, meaning everything else builds on top of them.

And the job market at the time was such that you could get to a the technical interview stage with just that.And I was a junior who had been grinding hard for a year at that time. I found most of the technical interviews I did to be laughably easy, and ended up with 3 job offers in 2 months of job searching and interviewing.

In a case such as this, yes, the H1B worker is paid less. 2. Non-contract worker: Many companies in the US, including all the FAANGs, directly employ foreign workers. These workers are also on H1B visas (sometimes on other visas as well, such as O1 or L1) and are paid like any other employee at the company. Hope this answers your question.",

        "body": "Hi, I work with a bunch of H1bs at a reputable software engineering company. Keep in mind that my answers are going to be based on visas from a company that does follow the spirit and letter of the law. There is not a direct pay gap between H1bs and regular employees who are hired at the same level of experience. However, H1bs have much less _leverage_ to negotiate their position particularly as the years go by. This doesn't necessarily lead to them getting underpaid relative to other employees, but it means that they're more likely to accept worse conditions or volunteer (or be voluntold) for work that they might not have to. This is especially bad for people who have to wait a long time to get a green card.Additionally, if you've worked in tech for a while, you'll know that usually the best way to increase your salary is to job hop, and staying at the same company is not typically rewarded- I will get a 7% payrise this year, but I know that if I could switch to another company I'd likely get a 20-30% payrise. It's harder to switch companies as a H1b, so their wages will grow slower than peers in their industry.Companies are required to go through certain steps in order to sponsor a H1b to prevent harming the local economy that a worker is being hired into, the LCA. The LCA effectively requires paying the potential employee the higher of the prevailing wage for the area for the job of that employee, or what that employer would pay other employees with similar experience. Some H1bs do get paid less (but not where I work) because they are a H1b. There are some companies out there that essentially offer you relocation to the US as a job perk and may not pay you well - WITCH companies, mostly. These companies don't have much interest in fair working conditions and will offer relocation to the US to people who I would consider vulnerable, mostly Indians, and will preferentially hire Indians, especially from similar castes as the hiring manager.And, obviously, when you have more people competing for the same position that nominally drives down wages. However, the companies that abuse this system - WITCH companies, again - never intended to hire an American to do the job. An American job is not being displaced by a WITCH company hiring an Indian (although it _is_ still abuse of the H1b system).Simplistic gut-feeling analyses on \"increasing supply\" affecting wages fall short because they don't take into account a whole bunch of things, not least that a more productive economy with more workers generally leads to more job opportunities in the economy as a whole. As an extremely simplified example, a software shop being set up in a city might prompt a starbucks branch being built nearby to capture the market of higher paid engineers, that might otherwise not exist, which means that the hiring of some engineers (of which some might be H1bs) leads to more tax revenue for the locality as well as more job opportunities, just not _the same_ job opportunities. This is why, in general, immigration is viewed as a positive for the economy",

It was a long time ago, when there was a huge backlog for all countries, not just India and China. So after my green card arrived, i started being able to climb the ladder towards top companies 1-2 years at a time, getting significant raises every time. I was making double in 4 years.Also note that when you are applying for permanent residency, you get labor certification for a certain job description. Moving that job description upwards is kind of risky, as you would not be doing the task you got the certification for. So it might slow down your growth anyway.None of this would actually be relevant if the path from H1B to permanent residency was remotely reasonable. But it isn't, and I can't imagine congress actually wanting to change it.",

This isn't a big deal if you're actually an expert with in demand skills because there will likely be other openings. However, if you're just a general software engineer in the current job market, you're going to work more hours or take on extra responsibility to avoid having a 60 day count down to going home.The whole premise of the H1B program is to help with situations where we don't have enough qualified people to fill a certain role. When it's used in those situations, it doesn't hurt anybody because H1B holders have enough career mobility to avoid getting underpaid or overworked and US residents won't get pushed out because visa holders are filling a gap, not competing with US workers. If we grant 2000 H1B visas to MDs who want to work in the US, that's fine because we have a shortage of doctors and those visas will benefit the H1B workers without negatively impacting US workers. If we grant 40000 H1B visas to entry level tech workers, which already face high unemployment rates, that not only goes against the goals of the H1B program, it makes the job market worse for all workers involved. Some H1B holders will earn less, some H1B holders will be forced to work under unfair conditions to keep their visa status, supply will exceed demand causing wages to drop, and US workers will have to either accept the unfair conditions or get replaced by an H1B holder who will.Under paying H1B visa holders happens at some consulting companies, but even at companies that pay them the same wage as US workers, it's a problem when the system is abused.",

You don't have to be a social butterfly, as long as people trust you and find you reliable you should be doing fine.I have some coworkers who are literally acoustic and wouldn't be able to carry a conversation outside work, it's fine as long as they do their work and are reliable. Only red flag is if you are toxic or don't want to engage in conversations relevant to work.I'm a good friend with several coworkers and we have gamed and gone out together several times, but we also have people with their own family and children who you'll never hear off after work, and we also have special people who don't talk too much and do their own thing.",

And vice versa.If you apply to hundreds of places with literally 0 interviews, now you can pretty safely say the issue is your resume. I wouldn't say it's your GH right away, professional experience outweighs anything you could possibly put on your GH. It might just be how you're portraying your professional experience, in which case, study up on how to write strong technical resumes. Don't just ask people to review yours and give you feedback. Actually study how to write one so *you* know what makes a good/bad resume. Give a man a fish vs. teach a man to fish.But if you start applying, and you're getting some bites, great. You don't really need to pad your github, or pad your resume. Your current resume is working for you. Once you're in the interviewing stages it should be pretty easy to see where things are breaking down and work on improving those things. If you're not making it past HR/HM, you're probably pretty weak in behavioral interviewing. If you're not making it past technical rounds, you probably need to work on leetcode/system design. Etc.",

The 3 month window will be tough to hit as you'll probably find that getting responses from applications will be a challenge in the current environment. This is why it'll help tremendously to utilize your network. These will help you get through that application barrier, and then you get to interview. Sadly, having an internal reference is not a guarantee for a job either. So you'll need to brush up on your interview skills. If this sounds impossible to do in 3 months for you, I'd start applying for an in-between job to hold you over until you find your way back to a software gig again. That's what I ended up doing. Best of luck to you!",

Everyone feels like they have a good handle on the requirements and tasks that need to be done. You have a clear map of what needs to happen, and the dimensions the code needs to be flexible in. Maybe you've even been around on enough projects to know that if you invest time upfront, you'll be set up for success later when it's a time crunch, so you might work a little more to keep everything nice and clean and documented. Then, the inevitable comes. Either some requirement changes, or maybe there was a miscommunication - but whatever the case, that nice timeline and architecture you had in your head gets absolutely wrecked. All the time you spent making sure the code was flexible in X, Y, Z directions ends up just being more refactoring, and undoing to get the code into the state it needs to be in to pass unit tests, or meet requirements. Now, it's not about writing good code, you have like X time to do an assignment that should take 2-4x time. You just need to get it done ASAP and ship it. Sometimes you get things cleaned up, but the code looks inflexible, and like it's just duct taped together, which it usually is. Sometimes you don't even get everything cleaned up from what you thought the project was going to be. You do stuff in weird, unintuitive ways, because when you built the framework/foundation, you thought it was going in a different direction, but it's too much effort to rebuild the foundational code from scratch 70% of the way into a project without having to start from scratch. But anyway - that's usually how it happens in my experience. It's just that when you start out on a project, especially with a lot of people/teams involved what you think the project is going to be, and what it ends up being can look very different.",

He got poached by another university and they offered him a salary that his current university couldn't even begin to match. He came back and told them that he'd accept only if they also hired his two friends at that same level. And they did. I think that group stuck together for over a decade.A department I taught at had previously merged with another school. During the merge, faculty were applying elsewhere or leaving, and the department had to find a way to retain some of them. One of them was like, \"I'll stay if you hire my brother.\" The department did, and they've been there for like 20 years.Make friends. Find people you like working with, stick together, and you can create your own culture. I've taken pay cuts in industry to continue working with friends because it's worth it to me.",

I have friends, with random ass degrees (commerce, psych etc.) who get to do some dev stuff now, because they jumped into unrelated roles at companies that have dev teams at companies that encourage upskilling and push you upwards within the company.I mean, good for your friends, but the more likely outcome of this is to stagnate in a dead-end job. And obviously a dead-end job is better than no job, but this isn't the '60s where someone gets hired as a typist, stays with the company for 20 years, and rises up to senior vice president.This is coming from someone with a random ass degree who got into the field via \"just applying,\" and just got another job via \"just applying.\" I don't know why this worked for me, it shouldn't have worked for me, but I can't argue with reality.",

That happened to me, ended up in faang for the money, got piped and fired 3 years later. Even during my time there i didnt think there was much upward mobility.

I did not really practice LC - I did a few problems for fun, but in no way would I consider would I did \"grinding\", nor did I make any attempt to memorize the solutions. The 3 LC interviews that I did get were all mediums where I was able to work out non-optimal but reasonable solutions, and I passed the interviews despite my non-optimal solutions.Probably worth mentioning that the non-LC coding interviews I received by and large still required a strong grasp of CS fundamentals like recursion and proper use of data structures. So if you're not solid with that kind of thing, then practicing LC may still help. I would also not say that the non-LC coding interviews are necessarily easier than LC - just that their difficulty is more about turning complex requirements into code than about figuring out \"this one neat trick\", which I do think is a more fair type of difficulty and more reflective of job skills. Also I did not interview with any FAANG companies, and I think they are more notorious for having LC interviews.The vast majority of my interview prep time was spent on practicing systems design and fleshing out my behavioral interview stories, and personally I thought that was a much better use of my time than grinding LC (as a senior candidate).",

I ask them why they still work. Their base pay is less than their capital gain.So you see, there’s always a greener field. You decide when is enough. In terms of family, I’m also an immigrant, and I miss my family as well. I think at least I have to secure all 6 years of H1B money.

Then it linked leetcode study guides that included practice questions to better udnerstand how to code it. Honestly was a great study guide, not sure why they took it out. The videos are still there write in youtube \"hacker rank data structures\". Here is one of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh\\_OwMljA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA) In my opinion do not fall into the \"grind leetcode for 200 hours\". You might get a job that way, but i have found many interviewers can tell when you dont understand the problem and are just copying what similar leetcode problems did. Because they dont mind changing up the problem halfway through if they noticed you got there too quickly. They'll change one little thing in the problem and ask you to re-do it and the way you did it wont work. So there is a lot of having to understand DSA to get the job. Learn how to think outloud because that's what most of them expect. They dont care if you get it right, just how you think. Ive gotten jobs and havent gottent their questions right. Also, tackle problems piece by piece. I have found that once i write one line of code, i am less stressed and tackle the problem better. So usually the first thing i do is tackle the base cases. Let's say I have to re-arrange an array. First line i write is \"if(array.empty())\". Then i tackle the next base case and i ahve found that once you go through it the asnwer kind of starts resolving itself as you tackle the base cases.",

I've gotten close a few times, but didn't get the offer. Now I think the career gap is hurting me more than anything. Granted I was not in a tech hub like Seattle is. Go to some in person events and network a bit before you commit to leaving your company. Build up a small network if you can. And as for burn out, taking time off and relaxing helps some but really therapy has been amazing for me. There are therapists that specialize in whatever types of issues you are having like work stress, adhd, isolation, etc. If you've never done therapy before and want to know more about how to get started on that just message me. I started in my second year of unemployment when really I should have signed up as soon as I quit my job, probably even before that",

So 15 different companies for the 28 positions. + outside LinkedIn like DataDog, Coinbase.Out of the 15+2 companies, had recruiter calls from 13 companies. The 4 companies that did not reply were Roblox (sucks cause I got interview there before), Affirm (sucks cause I got interview there before), ~~MongoDB (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there)~~, Pinterest (sucks cause I got interview there before), DataDog (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there).In my inbox, have many dozens of recruiters requesting to do an interview. Many well paying desperate firms like Carta, Decagon, Vanta, Valon, TikTok, Meta, DE Shaw, Stubhub, Lyft, Anduril, DoorDash, Ramp, Amazon, etc. And crap ton of AI grift startups/firms which constantly clog up my inbox daily.I got rejected from OpenAI at phone screen this time but I blame the interviewer.

Honestly not interested in the WLB and have no thoughts moving to NYC when I have made my life here right now (maybe in the future).I'm sure if I spray and prayed full stack, infra, databases, etc. roles then my response rate would be garbage as well. But then again, I'm sure if I applied mid level roles for those I would get calls left and right but then why would I?And no. I don't bother with referrals, connections, etc. Not my thing. Never needed to. I was able to get interviews at Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snap, Databricks, Citadel, etc in the past without any problems anyway. Ivy League degree helps.Definitely worse than covid era. During covid era, I essentially had 90% response rate at tech firms and near 100% response rate at non tech firms. But then again, I'm not applying for mid level roles so to be expected. Plus, I am a lazy individual who has no thoughts min-maxing my career so that plays a part as well. I've let my experience rot my skills for job market but I don't care. I value life outside work a lot.>Curious if there are any suggestions or comments on day to day learning and interview prep?Just take life chill. Don't overthink. Life is too short to stress these stuff too much.That said, be good at Leetcode. Try to aim for 95% pass rate on coding interviews.And spend time on studying System Design. That's the most important once you are out of new grad.\\-Update: MongoDB just replied to start process. Perfect timing. LOL. But I won't be starting the process anyways.",

Think about it you can be the engineer who gets good reviews from other Jrs. Or the engineer who gets good reviews from Jrs and Srs/Principals. Guess who is getting the promotion if they only have enough for 1 more person\\- Find out the go to people and ask them questions. Your first few months should be figuring otu the right teams to ask questions, maybe you have a mentor who helps you find those people. Once you figure it out, cut the umbilical cord yourself and just go to those teams and ask those questions. Dont go striaght to the mentor anymore so he/she can baby sit you.\\- Take as much shitty tasks as you can. If a principal is working on somethign that sounds cool, ask him for even small tasks about it. Let him know that if there is anything you can do even if it's small and tedious youll do it. You want to dip your toes in everything you can.\\- Make sure you are known by other people on other teams. One of the biggest things managers appreciate is hearing someone's name in another team that has nothing to do with you. because it says you have become a go to person for your own team. If upper management keeps hearing your name from other teams or how they went to you and you helped, that goes a long way. Basically the key is making sure your name is always mentioned when your boss has meetings with his bosses.\\- Be good at getting yourself unstuck from situations. The biggest issue Jrs have is they get stuck and just sit at their desk for 2 days and say nothing. Dont fall in that trap, you get stuck, give yourself an hour to figure it out and if you still dont have it ask even a small question. In stand up, bring it up from the start and expalin it well.\\- If you work on something learn it back and forth. You can become an unoffical SME of your part of the codebase. The larger the section you master the more irreplaceable you become.\\- Make up your own work if you have to. Find something in the code that could use refactoring but nobody had time to do it. Suggest it to your manager like \"hey i saw this in the code and i felt it could use a bit of refactoring, mind if i work on that on the side?\".\\-Dont just get good at coding, get good at leading meetings. This is probably one of the bigger ones. Because JRs tend to be in the background and wait to be told what to do. if you want to move up quickly, start making meetings and presentations to display to your teammates. One advice i got was, if you complete something ask for 10 minutes post-standup to display it to the team. Because if you want to be a senior or principal that's what they will look for.",

It's so bad that this sub has auto-modding to keep the posts from overwhelming everything. I see FAANG-adjacent and you're using FAANG level. It's so silly. You can say Big Tech, at least that's definable. Also land of the biggest layoffs.>I also leetcode on the side for an hour a day as a long term plan for FAANG interviews.If you apply to the 5 out of the 495 Fortune 500 companies that want you to know algorithms you'll never code on the job then okay. Else you're wasting your time. In fact, stay in your current job if you don't hate it and don't get 2% raises 2 years in a row. Moving is a risk and not being a job hopper makes you less of a hiring risk.>DSA feels like a skill I’ll need regardless and I want to be able to ace OAs / coding rounds in the future.It is not. I'm mid-level and half my interviews have zero coding. It's talking through business challenges, tech stacks and maybe a design problem I draw on a real or virtual whiteboard. I don't know what \"OA\" is and I didn't know \"DSA\" meant when I got to this sub. I learned all data structures and algorithms I've ever needed from the classroom. My coworkers don't know what FAANG or Blind or Leetcode are. Coding tests are practical.>For those of you who’ve seen juniors rise fast:I saw one junior rise fast because he took smoke breaks with the senior manager. All of a sudden he became our manager. I saw another junior gradually move through the ranks. Stayed at the same employer for over 10 years. She was an average programmer but good at office politics and being well-liked.All you got to be is average at coding. You can be an excellent problem solver which for me comes from work experience. You can be very well liked which is also insurance against layoffs. You can drink the company Kool-Aid and embody stockholder ideals. Like be married to your job. Those are all paths upward. Interviewing skill / soft skills carry you further the higher you go.Problem is, getting paid 20% more to work 50-55 hours a week sucks, on top being responsible for work intake and training of new hires. I had 12-15 hours of meetings a week and my manager had 30. Doesn't include 1:1 mentoring sessions.Oh and promotion track is real. You will be told if you are on it. I was, once, then my manager got transferred and the replacement one didn't really like me.",

The new tech would take longer to implement and often times be less stable than what the team is used to writing.

My first month they had me doing BS work before i met the team and then my 2nd month they had me updating comments. This was the most chill job i ever had but i was also a jr.\\- 2nd job was big tech (mag7 company). They had me learning shit before i even started at the company. Like my manager sent me videos of the new system they were trying to integrate and asking me to watch the videos. I should've known how that was going to be the second he sent me 10 hour long videos and i hadnt even started. That job was so stressful that within month 1 it was like they wanted me to be an expert at things already as a mid-level.\\- current job is also big tech but not as big as 2nd company. They have been super chill. Like another commenter said, it took me 2 weeks to even get credentials enoguh to build and they were telling me to slow down that i should take my time before i really got into the code. 6 months in this job has been super chill but challenging tat the same time edit: forgot to add. I this company is already expecting you to be a high level person, especially if you are a mid-level or below (maybe even a senior) then this job sounds like it will be stressful. At most if you were a principal i could see why because you are being paid expecting that you already know things but you dont sound like you are that far in your career.",

They vary *widely* in terms of how accurately they check that the resumes they send match the requirements.The tricky part happens if you get submitted by one of the scummier / less-particular ones and then try independently applying to an unrelated position at the same company - sometimes they'll try to claim that they should still get their fee!",

That means your résumé was flagged as a potential match for one of the positions they’re actively trying to fill. In other words, this isn’t random. Take the 15 minutes.It’s also important to clear up a common misconception: a job being posted on a careers site does not *always* mean it’s actively open for hire. Likewise, a role can be open and available to fill even if it isn’t posted publicly.Think of a job posting like a flyer on a bulletin board. If someone was already hired but the recruiter forgot to take the flyer down, it can look like “there was never a real job.” On the flip side, if the recruiter is hiring but chooses not to hang a flyer, it doesn’t mean they aren’t hiring—it just means the posting isn’t public. What truly matters is whether the *requisition* is open and approved as a **headcount**. That’s what determines if someone can be hired.P.S. Internal recruiters for Microsoft are not paid on commission. They are salaried full time employees, or hourly contractors. Their comp is not determined by number of candidates, though they do have metrics to adhere to.",

Others are still using LC style questions, so you’ll need to do research on the company to find out what their process is like. Personally I welcome this change. I never felt that LC was a great indicator of on the job performance more than it was an indicator of who was willing to grind problems and memorize how they were solved. That being said, I’d always make sure that you have strong fundamentals.

That’s not to say it would necessarily hurt your career to go with Grainger, though—you’ve shown that you can get multiple offers already! Visa’s ladder is pretty strict from what I experienced in that most people follow similar promotion timelines regardless of performance.The savings from living with your parents would definitely put a decent dent over the comp at Visa (rent would probably be anywhere from $12,000-30,000 post tax depending on roommates, quality of apartment, etc.)",

West coast means more and better tech opportunities. It's possible you'd have better quality of life in Chicago, especially if you prefer city living (and eventually move out). I don't really consider Chicago to be much of a tech city. If it was, housing would be considerably more expensive. Most of the tech work in the area is tied to finance, consulting, pharma and other corporate flavors. While some tech companies have a presence, it's noticeably smaller. A 1.5 hour commute will be brutal. I worked at a company that did consulting work for Grainger, but I never worked on a project for them. I got the impression their tech was kind of weak. A lot of other companies in that area (far north suburbs, I believe) are dominated by Indian dev teams and management - both local and offshore. The horror stories you read on this sub where an Indian manager comes in and the entire tech team becomes Indian is a big problem with a lot of companies in that area. I can't speak to Grainger, specifically, so you should ask around and try to find more info. I suppose the possibilities of this will be pretty high at Visa, too.",

You're not just writing one application so on paper you're more than one person others are competing for that position. Let's take a hypothetical scenario where there are 50 people looking for a job and there are 50 positions open. Everyone applied to every position. On paper this means you are competing with 49 other people but just because you aren't the best in those 50 people doesn't mean there is no job for you. Of course this is a scenario where demand and supply is equal but even if you are the exact median, the demand would have to be more than twice the supply for you to be left out.

You’re not trying to be perfect for everyone, just undeniable for a few.For interviews, aim for above-bar consistency, not brilliance. Do 45-60 minutes a day on a tight set of patterns until mediums feel routine, and talk through problems with a simple loop - clarify constraints, propose baseline, optimize, test - recording yourself to fix pacing and signal. For systems design, use a repeatable template and practice one scenario a day. Ditch spray-and-pray: send concise, specific cold emails to engineers and hiring managers at focused targets, reference a pain they have, share a tiny artifact or plan, ask for a quick chat, then the referral; say yes to contract-to-hire or smaller teams to get momentum.

When you screw up, as we *all* do, step up and take responsibility before anyone even thinks to ask. How you *respond* to failures is vastly more important than your rate of failure. -Some of my most engaging stories to pull out for interviews focus around what I did to recover from mistakes.Remember that anyone hiring you is agreeing to spending *almost half their waking hours* with you for the foreseeable future. Would you say yes to hanging out with someone for 40+ hours a week that you don't think you'd get along with, don't feel you can trust, etc? Of course not. Teams are hiring *new friends* as much as they're hiring a new coworker and if you don't believe that then you *absolutely* aren't the sort of person they're looking for.",

I was an SWE for 5 years before that transition, and with this same company for 3 of those SWE years. I've been responsible for some transformative toolsets. I was positioned well and absorbed a ton of product knowledge (was on a core framework team) before transitioning. I'm also of the opinion devops works best when there's buy-in from multiple angles (if not org-wide in the first place).I'm of the opinion the best DevOps engineers are SWE first and infra/automation second, and I will often introduce myself as an SWE with a passion for DevOps. As a DevOps engineer you build natural buy-in by understanding the stack and making developers lives' easier and velocity faster.My particular company is a dinosaur in tech years (been around since the 70s in some form or another -- 5+ name changes over the decades). We are a tech company, and yet we're relatively unknown. There are people that have been here 30-40 years. There are still moments where it's difficult to break old patterns of monoliths and shared dev environments. Tools like Git and Docker are sometimes difficult to get them to use properly -- while Cloud lives and breathes containers, I introduced them to Dev just 5 years ago. Dev only just moved to git around that same time (from SVN and before that MKS).These days transformation is key. We're seeing the transformation with AI, now anyone can be an SWE or DevOps engineer. Real SWEs are problem solvers and evolve and adapt to the problem to be solved.",

Single most critical thing: the delta between senior and returning intern is probably another undergrad worth of material you learn on the job.The second biggest risk, is besides learning or getting screwed with a performance review for structural reasons, is burnout. Any intense field carries this risk.To avoid this, you need to figure out what motivates you, find a way to chase it at the company, and just keep your head straight. Everybody gets burnt out when you just endlessly chase reward but come up short, you're brain learns it's not worth it. It's just reinforcement learning. Also, even when you feel like shit, it really pays to find it in yourself to put the work in, try not to care, and move the ball. It's not a game of inches, but one of miles.Personally, I've had a pretty good run chasing impact, and not caring about anything else besides helping my team. By doing that, it's problem after problem, each with increasing responsibility. Some days will feel like shit, but realizing most days are days you've done before makes it much easier.",

Your manager's reasoning for lack of promotion *\"it just doesn't happen after 1 year\"* is very poor. Each individual performs uniquely. They have to advocate for you when trying to promote you, so if their logic just falls into \"it's not usually how it's done here\", there's no spine. What could you have done better? What's the company state wrt promotions right now? Is there something you're missing? That would be helpful feedback. FYI, sure you need a great relationship with your manager, but also consider skip manager, you want leadership visibility and to have them on your side.I don't think it's a good idea to \"negotiate\" annual rise.

I think I've seen this question just about once per month, every month, for all 10 years, and I think I posted it myself 10 years ago.The answer is: nobody knows. However, I can say that today, every Salesforce developer I know has no problem getting a job, even in this shitty job market. When Google lays off 1,000 people from their engineering teams, 998 of them are software engineers and 2 of them are salesforce developers. You're competing with the 2, not the 998 that everyone else is competing with. Those 998 do not want to go anywhere near Salesforce, they see it as a downgrade that is below them.Additionally, the Salesforce development talent in India / overseas is notoriously horrible and you'll interview literally 100 people before you find one that isn't a net negative for your business, so there's not much overseas happening (also, Sales people want to talk to onshore, english-speaking Salesforce developers, they don't want to be talking to Indian developers at 2am). AI models are really mediocre with Salesforce concepts because Salesforce codebases are very rarely public and are not often represented in training data, so AI is not a big job risk either. Salesforce themselves can't even produce good AI tools for their own product. But again, nobody knows, that's the reality. Salesforce *could* go poof and disappear somehow.",

I got the LEO idea from reading a post on here about a guy who went on a ride-along and quit his tech job because he loved it. Haven't completely ruled it out, I might go on a ride-along next year if I'm still unemployed. Also thought about various masters degrees- therapist / counselor, physical therapist, law school (maybe patent law). The debt from those is a deterrent for now. Teaching math keeps coming up- maybe next year I'll try shadowing a teacher and then try subbing and go from there if I like it. Pay's shit which sucks but there is a pension. Tattooing, I have friends who do it, but the social media self marketing doesn't appeal to me and I'd need to dust off my drawing skills big time. The hustle involved as well as the learning curve are daunting but it seems like a really fun job. Trades are meh. I used to do them and I'm physically a little beat up. Worst case scenario I could probably pick up some carpentry work but I'm not excited about it because I know my back and knees will be killing me. Ideally I'll land a swe role or some kind of analyst / data position. I've been applying for everything i can find but my god it's tough as hell to find entry level swe work right now.",

FEED, as I understand it, is simply a very thorough form of project planning done prior to beginning implementation/providing a quote. It's not *specific* to those things you listed. Those were just examples. \"Project Scope\" is the important bit of that section, along with timeline, quotes, project organization, etc.Especially if the company you applied to builds things for customers, and bids on projects, rather than building/running their own product, it seems pretty reasonable that they would be legitimately doing FEED, and the SWE's would be heavily involved since it's a software project they're planning/selling.I have 12 YOE, and I don't recall ever hearing that acronym before... but there's lots of acronyms I haven't heard of. There is a ton of variety in the industry. After looking up what FEED is, I can safely say I've never been involved in such a rigid and thorough project planning stage. I've worked mostly in agile shops where we're fast and loose with timelines, planning, and costs. Joining a company where their planning stage can potentially last months, *or years*, would certainly be a new experience to me. So it's good that they made it clear on the job posting that that's the project planning methodology they follow, because that's a pretty major culture indicator.",

Here's no details too\"The best junior coworker I had was someone who said \"hey, I'm not sure on how to solve this. I tried XYZ and looked at the README but I don't quite understand my issue. Could we pair on this when you have time?\" And then when we hopped on a meeting, they asked \"do you mind if I record this?\" None of the low effort posts give me the impression of that coworker, so it's not certainly someone I would like to work with. The onus is on the junior to ask thoughtful and insightful questions, it shouldn't be on the seniors to figure out what the question is.",

Good luck The longer you can’t find a job the less likely you are to find one- I was an alcoholic and it took me a few years to get my shit together, at that point I got sober and went for a masters in CS (switched to an IT bachelors middle of my sophomore year of undergrad). I was able to get an internship at an F500 and was hired there full time before graduation, been there 4 years now. So it’s certainly possible to get a CS job after graduation but you may need to take some extra steps",

You are willing to leave the company if they force you to do so...Second, you can accept the QA work but start asking around on that team like do people actually move into dev roles or onto other teams? If the answer is no, then chances are you’ll be stuck in QA. At the same time, make it super clear to your manager, like every other meeting, what your career goal is (to become a dev). Don’t let them forget.I went through something similar myself. I was hired as a new grad software developer, but they threw me on a IT support team where the tasks were just SQL ticket work. I told them no, I was hired as a developer. My manager was mad, my lead was mad, leadership was mad, I honestly thought they’d fire me. Eventually I found a frontend role on another team, and they let me switch, but it was pure luck.Then it happened again because I wanted to do backend or at least full stack work. So I started telling my manager I could handle and i know backend too. For a few months, I worked 11–12 hours a day, but telling my manager that i finshed my frontend tasks in 6, and then asked for backend tasks. Slowly, they let me help on a Spring Boot app, then Django, and eventually they trusted me to do backend and fullstack workSo yeah… if you’re not planning to just straight up tell them no, then you’ll have to do the QA work for now...because a job is a job...but still keep asking for dev work whenever you can (and continuing looking for outside opportunities)",

        "body": "It takes as long as it takes. Some folks land another job fairly quickly, others it'll take months.The biggest thing you're up against at the moment is the calendar. Lots of places slow down hiring as the year draws to a close. I was laid off in mid-October last year and told my wife if I didn't land something by Thanksgiving then it likely dry up until mid- to late January. Fortunately I landed something in November.It sucks losing your job, and if I recall from your previous post this is your first time going through this. I experienced being laid off at my first job after graduating, only being there about six months. Felt like an absolute failure, especially to my parents because I was still living at home. They were very understanding and mainly just felt bad for me, but we're happy to let me live with them as long as I was hunting for another job. Lots of folks will be more understanding than you realize, and for the ones who don't or seem to pull away I'd say you'll learn the \"value\" of those relationships.The best advice I can give you would be:1) Realize it's very likely not your fault and simply a business decision. This is not a reflection on you as a person or on your skills as much as you may think it is. You now know that most employers don't really value you or others as much as you may have thought.2) If there are local user groups for your field of study, attend those and network as much as possible. I've been able to keep my recent stints with layoffs fairly short due to the network I've built over the years. Talking with folks and getting their help in applying for open positions is gonna do more for you than online submissions where you're a name among hundreds or thousands of others. I landed my current position by going to a local user group and connecting with a staff engineer of the company hosting it, who was willing to submit my resume directly to HR for an open position.3) In the current market, you may need to be more open to both returning to an office to work and even taking short term contract gigs. Fully in office positions will likely have fewer applicants compared to hybrid, and both will have fewer applicants compared to fully remote. Taking contract work can also be an option, as most times those interview loops are one or two rounds and often not that involved. Part of this is because they can cut you loose at any moment and owe you nothing, because you likely won't have paid time off (you can take time off, just not paid). Benefits, if offered, can usually be stupid expensive depending on your needs, but contract work will almost always pay far better than unemployment, and keeps long gaps off your resume. It may lead to a permanent position, and if not then at least you avoid dipping into your savings for a while. You can absolutely keep interviewing for better gigs in the meantime.4) If needed, take part-time work somewhere or work in something adjacent to your field of study if possible. I floated by on support and sys admin type roles for about three years, from 2009 to 2012, because I was a new grad with minimal experience losing out on jobs to folks who had that experience. I managed to stay close to the industry and make decent money from it while waiting for my time to get back into SWE jobs in full.I get it man, losing a job sucks and is a big hit to your mental. Know that you're not the first to experience this, you won't be the last, and this may not be your last time experiencing it. There's gonna be aspects of paranoia about it happening again going forward and you just gotta learn how to deal with it. The best way to deal with it is to build both a solid amount of savings, along with a solid network of folks you can reach out to if it ever happens again.You'll get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.",

Many areas program like statisticians, accountants, CNC operators, etc, fewer actually engineer.Even historically safe industries like hospital staff (nurses in particular) are being laid off now due to budget cuts.You GenZ folks are too young to remember how bleak tech was during the GFC.

There are masters in CS geared towards quantitative but not CS backgrounds. You should look into those.

Companies in those countries still want to see proof you can do the work so your best bet is to keep building strong projects, maybe earn one or two big cloud/devops certs (like AWS or Azure), and make your LinkedIn/GitHub shine. When you graduate, you’ll stand out to employers. Studying abroad is also expensive, and if you don’t land a job in that window, it can feel like wasted money. But tech roles are still in demand in those countries, especially cloud, backend, and DevOps. If you’re serious and willing to network, apply early, and show your skills, you have a very real shot. So studying abroad can be a good path if you see it as both education and a bridge into that country’s job market. It’s not guaranteed, but with your experience and effort, it’s definitely possible.",

It shows that you’re committed to a career in data and analytics. This can help you stand out if you’re going straight for data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant roles. But data science is competitive as many people enter with a PhD or years of experience. So, with just a master’s, you’d want to build a strong portfolio of projects, maybe internships, and show you can apply your learning to real world problems.If you want maximum flexibility and aren’t 100% sure whether you’ll go into pure data or something adjacent, stick with Computer Science. If you’re confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science. Since you’re also open to more human facing roles like data consultant, either degree could work. Employers will usually care less about the exact title and more about your ability to explain data clearly, work with stakeholders, and use tools like Python, SQL, and visualization platforms.
