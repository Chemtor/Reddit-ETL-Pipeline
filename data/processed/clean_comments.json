Those at the senior level, like many of us here, will not have any issue finding work - networking alone being a game changer. Then there is the issue of soft skills versus technical skills. The longer you have been in the workforce, the more likely you are to have honed the soft skills needed for interviews. There are many relatively new DE's that are technically proficient but, due to a host of reasons (don't get me started), do not have the skills to interview well. I've also decided to ignore my impulse to see everything as LLM-generated. I've personally written a few work proposals where I've been accused of such (no silly graphics or bullet points btw), and those that use LLMs are the first to assume everything written now is the same. I also have family where English isn't their primary language, so it can often be used for translation, and the user is left with terrible formatting.",

I left them, with a single query for their dashboard. And yet they struggle to do this and need my assistance. Fine, happy to help, but like, comparatively this is a joke. I think I wouldn’t mind this so much if I knew that I was paid significantly more than them, but it’s the opposite. I found out a while back that the analyst working on this project makes just about the same that I do. So my question is, do you ever feel under-appreciated and how do you deal with that? How would you suggest I bring up my concerns of imbalance with my manager?",

I did this a while back with the snowflake query log so I could understand our costs better. Try to get to a point where writing the SQL to answer your questions flows naturally and quickly. The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.You'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few placesFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)Websites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.For performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in. For snowflake I found some articles on [https://articles.analytics.today/](https://articles.analytics.today/) helpful. But you'll need to find sources relevant to you.",

        "body": "Gonna give a different perspective here. I’ve been around the block and have worked with quite a few job roles in my time. Data engineering is one of the most lucrative fields in IT. Data engineers are really really well paid. On the stress spectrum, it’s also on the lower end. It’s also one where a lot of self-teaching is still a valid pathway forward.There are other IT roles where the entire company is down and you’re stuck working days straight to fix it. Or security professionals, when the company is under attack 24 hours a day and everyone is looking at them to fix it and then blaming them for what happened.In your case, I would say much of the stress is coming from layoffs, and a management that does not really understand AI and what it’s used for. Bad leadership looks at AI as a way to reduce headcount. Good leadership looks at it as a productivity tool. It should be helping to get more work done and a more streamlined, quality product.Also, AI should not be replacing the templating and standards. That’s up to the lead to come up with and enforce.I do think AI is giving a lot of people some existential crisis issues. However, I think using it is going to be required for almost all roles. Personally, I treat just like any other tool, like a spreadsheet, or a calculator, or a web search. Not using it means I am gimping myself, so why would I fight it and try and use the old way? The AI can’t think for itself. That’s where humans come in and will never be replaced. Someone still still needs to understand everything at the higher level, figure out what needs to be done, and glue it all together.If it was me, I’d take a step back and take some breaths. Or take a few days off and don’t think about work. Seems like burnout and a perspective check is needed here.Finally, you mentioned you want to quit, but have you asked yourself, what are you going to replace the job with?",

I've found with Claude, it can help with some of the more manual steps and freeing time up for other things.Anyway - stay positive. Maybe there's another job out and it's worth opening yourself up to recruitment over the next 3-6 months and you can find a better company that's less toxic?Might even be worth doing that anyway if you are really feeling down. Not everywhere is the same, and there's a lot of options out there. Even maybe moving abroad if that's an option?Good luck!",

Of course, AI is not going to take jobs away. they will change and evolve. But we're not obliged to like this new thing it's evolving into. A lot of people will say that they're OK with AI taking out the coding part, so that they can focus on the architecture part. And that's ok too!!!! We're all ice cream (DE) enjoyers here.. some people like the chocolate flavor, others prefer strawberry… and I think of all this as AI having taken some flavors off the market. Those who didn’t like the extinct ones obviously rejoice and don’t even understand the bleakness of losing your favorite ice cream flavor from the shelves… It's perfectly ok to just not like your work anymore, you know. Everything you've learned in life *will* be useful to you somehow. I'm getting ready to go back to college and pursue a career closer to my theoretical education (econ & finance), and even if that means low/no income for a period, a job that will no longer be remote, or one that doesn’t demand as much from me, it’s better to pursue this rocky road than to live with a feeling of eternal “meh,” which seems to be your case too.

Unfortunately we're currently living through a period of FAFO, where it's normal to tear down status quo, including gov't regulations for novelty because going viral is where the money is. The same thing happened with the blockchain craze, and the people who understood the tech were right to point out that all you need was immutable dbs to solve most of the use cases that were used to hype the trending tech. I feel the same as you do, but companies will need to learn the hard way, because the world of VCs have convinced companies large and small that the only way to be worth more or to enhance productivity is to jump to the next novel tech that is going viral - This works great for start ups attempting to pump up their valuations, but not so great for companies that are larger with processes and governance in place. This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. You're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital. It's all a game, but that does not mean that the pleasure you gained from building data pipelines no longer gives you satisfaction. You just need to find other corps that are mindful of assessing premature tech before jumping head first into the latest and greatest - there is a reason companies like Apple and Costco maintained their lead this long.",

Use this time to invest heavily in your skill-set and/or education, whilst learning the business fundamentals. For e.g., learn Python ASAP - as SQL, other than for solving analytical problems, is not as safe as full-scale languages, which can integrate analytics with wider system and data contexts. That way by the time is can handle what you are doing now - maybe in a few years, you will have levelled up. It's better to embrace it I think.I would feel more concerned if you weren't using AI, and other people were then much faster than you as a result.",

It's just that the word junior isn't in your job title.In both, junior specific roles, as in, have junior in the title, are rare.I'm of the opinion the secret sauce is to teach yourself a little bit and go for mid level roles. There's a lot less competition because the vast majority of people are looking to be taught by more experienced people rather than teaching yourself on the job. The amount of resources and information available on the internet for doing most things IT related is staggering to the point it's more learning about what to search for.",

However, the roles are distinct.These can vary a lot, but they are, broadly:Analyst: Writes SQL, transforms data, and makes dashboards, sometimes interprets and presents the data to the business.Scientist: Finds ways to answer very complex questions or find patterns via creating models, also predicts trends.Engineer: Moves data around (pipelines), transforms data, maintains the platform (databases, permissions etc).Data engineering is a tricky area to get into. There aren't really junior DE roles. The typical path, and what you've identified, would be to work as an analyst or scientist to get exposure to these tools and technologies and then make the move afterwards.One emerging role that presents an excellent path to data engineering is analytics engineering. This role is a blend between data analyst and data engineer, doing a lot of data transformation and sometimes moving data with no code tools (fivetran, stitch etc).",

Instead I focused on maximizing skills and pay so I could have hobbies and the best life outside of work.

Doesn't even matter if work is enjoyable or not - even when it's not people get through it because they've got personal fulfillment figured out.A constant need to move to a new job is a symptom, not a conclusion: Even people with ADHD can learn to stick to one job, it just means they learn to treat their work differently or they need different positions/roles/subjects/industries/managers.Don't try to \"think\" your way out of this one, get help to identify what needs are left unfulfilled and get clarity before trying to move in any direction. Otherwise you'll just jump to random directions that might seem exciting at first and eventually burn out again because you haven't figured out the core need that is making you move.Try not to move until you've figured out what's making you move, and how to fulfill it.",

If there was a rewrite of the system to something new, that's interesting because it freshens up what you've been working on. Obviously one way around this is to get a new job, but I feel that sometimes merely introducing something new can make things exciting again. For example, are things written in Pandas? Try Polars.

If you've reach a level where you manage to have a good position with 30h a week in an office job with good pay, you are better off than maybe 90% of employees. I am afraid it does not get much better than that with this level of comfort, you may have unrealistic fantasies about other software jobs. There's an angle I have explored sometimes, which is working for an organization that makes you feel better ethically, such as a public service. The problem is that they always have worse working conditions and pay. I don't think a masters is going to help you get a better IT job as opposed to more years of experience, at your level of experience diplomas don't matter that much for recruiters I think. If you do it, do it for your own desire to learn without expecting too much from the career perspective, and try to do it while keeping a job, maybe some company will support it. Finally, as everyone else said, absolutely invest the money, free time and peace of mind your current stable position provides into your personal projects, relatives and hobbies.

They aren't super fixated on production-level experience, usually have some super passionate people, and chill workloads. You could start by looking for jobs at local colleges or something like HigherEd Jobs. Best of luck!",

The org culture and turmoil is causing you to second-guess. There are many options here, but I think if you leave this organization for a better DE team, you'll find career satisfaction.

The query for this report was hitting our base tables in the raw layer with multiple joins and full table scans and union alls etc.. it was a mess. When we pointed the report to use our facts, performance improved significantly. The benefit here of course is performance. There are other benefits of using an actual modelled solution in the gold layer - control over all lookups - including, and this is crucial, those lookups that have no documentation and are just part of the hard-coded logic of your company's analysts in their scripts. putting most of your business requirements/KPIs in one model also helps everyone read and understand the tables which should reduce quality issues.

        "body": "Although there could be many if we go deep down documentation of both Airflow and Dagster but on top of my head in this context I would say they are 1. Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. Airflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

        "body": "First off, I have to say I'm genuinely curious, how did you land a DE role without an IT background? That’s seriously impressive. Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.Regarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of specific \"data engineering\" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It’s the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn’t matter which one—AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it’s the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.If you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts. Everything will make much more sense once you have these basics down.",

Separately, you can research whatever systems your team is using and break down by categories:1. SQL: Learn how to write SQL queries (use documentation for whatever language you're using and look up videos for that specific langauge).2. Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).I would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go. You will also need to understand what the modeling and data in your pipelines represent. Being able to explain data to the business is equally important to technical knowledge of how to store and manage data.",

I’d suggest asking them for some suggestions as to where to start, eg which tools should you ramp up on right away.

I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.The key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:- unit tests- automated linting- manually specify function type signatures where it matters- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.In the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. This was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.But it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference. It implemented those optimizations, made all the tests pass, and the resulting program was an order of magnitude faster.It could easily have taken me a month to do all this by hand.",

In other roles, some of the data science people I worked with had to deploy their ML projects which included the data pipelines. A few of them got a liking for that kind of work and eventually transitioned into data eng teams to get a deeper understanding and taste of it. I think the most important step for a successful career in general is to not think about your next roles as a \"make or break\".

How do you design solutions to problems if you've never worked within the constraints usually placed on data teams? Airflow and DBT help in the role as tools but what about when those won't do? Not everything fits neatly into them. Example, you need to move data from on-prem to cloud, data needs encryption at rest and in transit, how is DBT and Airflow helping? You can maybe orchestrate some in Airflow but actually nope, on-prem is behind firewall with local connectivity and limited egress only, no inbound connection for security and it cannot be exposed to a cloud based Airflow instance due to security team demands. How do you get the data where it's needed? You get into data engineering by starting with analytics roles and learning how the data lifecycle works and gaining experience, you develop your knowledge of the ways things work and progress from there. You wouldn't expect to leave school and immediately start neurosurgery, you'd work as a regular doctor and specialize over years before becoming a neurosurgeon. Its the same idea.",

When I started doing this I was using the Java flavor of it, but there are variations that run on Python and Javascript which I'd probably take a look at if getting into it again today. It's relatively simple to see how you can start pushing around pixels on a screen, and there's some nice libraries that add quality of life / neat features like liquid simulation. It's also completely free AFAIK.Touchdesigner ( [https://derivative.ca/](https://derivative.ca/) ) has a bit of a steeper learning curve, and is typically used to abstract all the manual code stuff from Processing into a node-based editor. It comes installed with Python so you can control everything manually in code if you want, but you'll quickly find a lot of shortcuts that you can do with the nodes that are a lot more performant than doing it with your own code. There's a free version with the main limitation being you your resolution is capped below HD, but in practice that's not a big deal for any given projector / LED wall. With this I've begrudgingly found Youtube tutorials extremely helpful- just search for some cool videos with cool thumbnails and it generally takes about 10 minutes of the designer stepping through through their network for you to have it running locally. good luck & have fun!! eager to see what other people are getting up to in this thread.",

I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff. There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.AWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. >Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.As always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability. You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.Leverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength. When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack). Work how your current skills fit into your objectives. Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.In both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. Once you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.However, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)2. `Arc` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)5. `PrimitiveArray` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)6. `ArrayRef = Arc` (trait object used in generic contexts)So, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.In **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \\- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'The result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.The point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation. Regardless, Arrow is brilliant and it's incredible what the team has achieved.",

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

That’s where Octo-Bloom helps — it can rule out non-existent values in microseconds from memory (zero I/O) and only falls back to the index when a match is possible. Huge win when you’re checking millions of emails/usernames that mostly don’t exist.I appreciate your question , if you have any suggestion or questions please ask it will help me to improve my skills",

In fact I'd suggest that any tool will make the easy 80% easier and the hard 20% harder.Schema evolution only makes sense if you can tolerate data quality errors. Here's a benign example: say that a file you're picking up with a bunch of cost columns suddenly has a new column. Lets call it fab_cost. It's a new column, so can you ignore it? Well, what if this is a new cost element that's being carved out of an existing cost element? If you ignore this fab_cost you're ignoring some of your cost - and your totals will no longer be accurate.So, *guessing* about schema evolution is just sloppy work for most production systems. The right answer most of the time is to define a data contract between systems - and validate it.",

Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems. I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point. Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions. Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest. There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT. This is needed to understand signals, etc. They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other. It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",

        "body": "Thanks for the excellent link.Patient_Magazine has a solid answer. It’s not just in pharma. OT is typically an underinvested and unappreciated area in technology and staffing. It’s like the opposite of sales lol.The software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.Also, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there’s not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.Good news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it’s not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there’s a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.Hopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.One tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group. Usually I’ve found this less of a technology issue but more of a perception and priorities issue.",

That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn’t an easier sell either, because our business won’t see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Our ETL processes were metadata driven so we had a way to trace the lineage of source data. I wrote stored procs that detected schema changes, made a list of all down stream tables, views, and ETL processes that could be affected by the schema change. The proc ran daily and if any change was detected an email was sent to a distro list that warned everyone about what would be broken. This kept management in the loop so that if a process or report started failing they would know it wasn't a data engineering issue it was a source issue. The in turn helped put a spotlight on the idiotic change practices that the dev group in charge of the source data was doing.",

I really like DMS -> Kinesis -> Firehose which will stream data to your snowflake table in real time. This requires some DMS settings adjustments but DM and I’d be happy to send. BUT if you have to restrict your Smowflake account to certain IPs then it’s no good because Firehose uses Amazon’s service range of ips which is like over 100 and they rotate and change constantly.So the DMS -> S3 is also solid just read the docs for settings.

It feels to me that doing this would be another temporary solution to a deeper problem (aka, treating oltp as olap - and expecting analytical-type speeds).I worked on a company with more users reading/processing data than what my current company has, and the Snowflake bill was quite modest (around 1,000.00 euro per month).

Quicksight-level controls are useful at the end of the pipeline, but I’m trying to catch privacy risks earlier in-flight, while still supporting rehydration for authorized consumers.Have you seen any approaches like this upstream of the BI layer?",

How each field will design and leverage data is entirely different and that's not really a point open to debate. Data Engineers aren't using SQLite in much (possibly a simple PoC or a metadata store but as the person you replied somewhat rudely to has said, DuckDB is usually a better option and most people in the field who do even a marginal amount of continuous professional development would prefer DuckDB over SQLite). Sys architecture might use it for demonstration/PoC but more likely will make a data architecture diagram and have DBAs build in a sandboxed RDBMS engine of choice to allow concurrent users of the PoC.",

You could jump into more advanced books like 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications' by Martin Kleppmann (also free online), but in my opinion that would mean skipping important steps. If you don’t already work with data, and since you mentioned 'projects' I’m assuming you’re not in a data role yet, and you don’t have a software engineering background, the chapters in that book will feel overwhelming because they assume you already understand core concepts. For instance, do you think knowing about different indexing algorithms and the relational vs non-relational debate is more useful to a complete beginner than knowing the basics of data modeling, what OLAP means, which businesses challenges data engineers have to solve etc first? Because imo it isn't, and that's exactly what you would get by jumping straight into a more technical book like DDIA.Joe Reis's book, 'Star Schema The Complete Reference' by Christopher Adamson, a complete and practical bootcamp/course, and projects. That's enough for a beginner imo. Let the technical stuff for later and avoid buzzwords and thinking you need to know all the tools (focus on the ones being required in your area, just so your CV gets selected).Edit: at least that's my personal experience, as a beginner with a data/business analyst background.",

You do things like trying to automate everything so you don't have to manually maintain stuff and make it robust because stuff changes all the time. Like someone running a source system releases a patch that breaks your pipeline and forgot to tell you it was going out. Or you have vague requirements from the users and are forced to iterate through stuff until they are satisfied. Or one of your processes missed a load because of some edge case and the CEO is pissed off because his numbers were wrong this morning. Or your data model is beautiful until the company makes some strategic shift and you have to change the way everything is measured along with aligning that to the last 3 years worth of data for consistency. Or they want you to rebuild the whole thing to make it \"real time\" because someone heard that's important on some podcast.Lots of people can move data from point A, transform it and put it at point B. But doing that as a job also requires you to figure out how it can break and catch or prevent that, make sure it's flexible for growth, how to deal with edge cases, etc. I think the big difference between data science or analytics and engineering is that you mostly have to load stuff once in the former while you need to make sure your data loads consistently in the latter.",

When using `:memory:`, you won't have any persistence.DuckDB by itself, even outside of dagster, handles its own multiprocessing. As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.To bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.Multiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.If you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (whether that's in memory or persisted on disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB.

That's not how databases are supposed to work.What you want is to have a single database with as many tables as you need to hold your data, and then parse all of the XML files - with Python, say - and write the contents of each one as rows of data to the required tables through one or more database connections. XML parsing is quick. Writing to rows to a database through an open connection is also quick. Creating databases is slow. Restructure your script to do things this way and performance should increase by orders of magnitude. Then - if you're still not happy with performance - you can look into parallelizing reads and writes. May well not be necessary though. Serially parsing a few million XML files is something that should easily be doable in under 5 minutes, unless each one is 10MB or something.",

Building everything yourself with FastAPI/Nginx is nice in theory, but it also means maintaining all the plumbing (auth, logging, monitoring, throttling, etc.) on your own. I’m looking for something that covers those basics out-of-the-box without locking me into an entire vendor ecosystem. More of a balance so not fully outsourcing, but not reinventing the wheel either.",

Rebuilding and maintaining all of that yourself can be error-prone and doesn’t scale well. A tool helps centralize those concerns instead of having a bunch of ad-hoc code scattered around.",

This is a mix of type 2, where each new version gets a new id, and type 1, so your fact table might have a “UserId” which is the id of the user to a single type 2 record, and a “Current User Id” - which may be the user id from the source system where IsCurrent = True in your dimension table.I recommend only using type 2 on columns you definitely want new records when it changes, but sometimes you get asked for a column in hindsight. You can either risk it, make a new record on a wider range, or all, columns, or keep the audit table of all changes just in case you need to rebuild it.",

WGU's model is more like a \"prix fixe\" menu - students pay a fixed price per term, and take courses from a set menu, with no electives or non-major courses. I have thought of taking one of the degree programs (BSDA or BSCNE) and studying the most high-value parts of the other program separately. For example, complete the BSDA, then study for and take the Network+, Security+, and Azure certifications separately.",

For example `raw/customer/25/08/01/customer.json.gz`. That way if I ever need to reprocess it’s easy to do so based of dates.For batch processing where you are only consuming the files periodically, I find it easier to have some type of ops or metadata file processing table, which keeps track of which files have already been processed.

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the \"best\" or \"most efficient\" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it. That week becomes a month.Most efficient method is to start with something and build from there.> Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insightsBy all means, take an introductory course into DE. I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful. That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.A lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I got my first DE job\". Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job. For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.The process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy. It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure. It's not to say that you can't do it. In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can. Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead. >Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?I will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head. Just go for mid. The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago. The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market. Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated. One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.Forget junior level positions. Aim for mid level positions. Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced. Be good at communicating. Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things. If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code.

That's why it's important to experience things in life, and not just academically. You should read fiction and non fiction, look at art, engage in philosophy, make yourself laugh or cry or scream with media. You should talk to people you wouldn't usually talk to, and visit new places. This is all food for your brain.I have a background in the humanities before starting with software later. I have always been analytic, but studying programming made my thoughts a little more... Idk, regimented? Mathematical? Something about troubleshooting bugs in particular has made me really, really appreciate the value of breaking things down in to small pieces and questioning all of my assumptions. This can be applied to many different parts of life.",

And there is no correlation with gender, former education, grades, IQ, nerdiness or all the other factors that people like to count. The only thing I have seen that they all have in common is curiosity, willingness to fail (not fail a course, but like falling of a bicycle, or missing a dance-step and getting up and try again), and a bit of a stubbornness, in that they *want* to fix the problem they currently have!Those I seen fail are mostly those who give up waaay too soon, or those who doesn't care about making something by themselves, but just want a finished result, so they can get on with other things. Like they have no pride in their work, they just want to be done.So those are the traits I see: **curiosity**, **courage**, **stubbornness**, willingness to try again and again and again, accepting even the smallest progress as a win!",

People consider me very weirdI started on basic in the 80s before high school. 1st pc in 85. IBM PS/2. whole 8hz. Pascal and turbo pascal by 93. One of the best languages to learn pointers. C-lang by 95. Html, while not a language a couple years later with css Java and Javascript. Some xml later and c++. Little later, obj-c, this was all prior to 2011 when I grew to hate it all.Guitar. Started in the summer of 88. Piano not long after that. Drums in the early 2000s. It's still my favorite instrument. Can do a bass but never had the finger strength. Spent many years off and on teaching music.1st time at college in fall 96 started algebra 1 and 2, then moved up to trigonometry and geometry. Never got to Calc summer of 98 and beyond was bad for many years. Still absolutely adore physics and cosmology. On regret is never picking up chemistryLinguistics major now focusing on teaching english as a 2nd language or foreign language. Started Spanish in 2004 in Atlanta while working tree service Picked up Chinese in the fall and spring semester last yearThe summer project was revamped for the entire 2018 cryengine for kingdom come deliverance. Ripped out all inverse kinetics animation bullshit. Reverse engineered the entire crisis 2 physics systems with ragdolls, recoil, and hut reactions. Warhorse had ripped out a good 97 to 98% of the system. That is all xml and lua tagged into a full c++ engine. Near total overhaul. Nothing like the original game.I also enjoy modding other games on the nexus. Full overhauls for several games now and a couple more deleted. Some of my hardest programming challenges I have solved in my brain whole I sleep. Can literally see the code roll past, and when I get up in the morning shit gets to work pretty quick.After a while, you start to think in other languagesI have had this happen with music, programming, and Chinese It is awesome Still can't get hired in the gaming industry. Tried for more than 20 years. I ran a mud for 15 years. Rewrote the entire thing. Went from 90kb to 8mb to 6mb depending on what year it was. Had hard-core. Skill based with 20 classes in by 2000. ended with a full random equipment generator and 1000+ skills spells and abilities and a full in game quest and quest reward system by 2003. Oh, and a planet and elemental system. And a complete random event system by 2005But ya know to this day, because I don't have a degree I don't have any experience getting into the industry . I pretty much have a doctorate in game design. Always the same e. Don't call us we will call youYes, it rewires your brain, and it is glorious And so many people will never understand that",

Language, art, music, and cultural identity never really interested me bc it felt very fluid and ever morphing with very grey lines. So coding was always likely a very natural path for me. But I would say ive had a different outcome in life. Instead of coding/programming as a job it'd been more of a passive hobby for me. Ive gotten exceptionally good at understanding underlying factors and influences that have shaped modern cultures, music, language etc. To the point that writing and expressing my thoughts is likely one of my strongest traits. But I think learning how to program ironically really helped with it. Objective oriented programming really helped shape my understanding of repeated actions creating ever growing outcome (loops). Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, \" if then\" statements. Oh my god it reshaped basic logic for me and how I view people's actions/decisions/fallacies. It made me infinitely more forgiving and compassionate to strangers and their mistakes. I was able to categorize and recognize thousands of what was just instinctive gut feelings into actual logic and language for me. It gave me a weird algorithmic way to categorize the world for me and ground me in a more \"human\" way. It helps me massively predict the outcomes of actions/consequences and think ahead in a way I hadn't considered before.",

Basically, when you ask a question, you should be at a point where you know the information you are looking for, but also know that you can't find it yourself.So, for example, asking \"how do I commit a change\" is not a good question, because it's vague, would take hours to answer fully and strongly suggests you have not done even basic research.Asking \"What is the URL of the GitHub server\" is a great question - I can answer it instantly, and there is no way you could have found it out yourself (errr - unless it's in the new starter guided in which case you shouldn't have asked it, obviously!).So, when asking a question (or raising a bug, or anything really) always start with \"What I did\", \"What I expected to happen\" and \"What actually happened\" - change those questions to ones that make sense for the question you are asking, but generally they are a good format for asking for help.People want to help - they just don't want to do your job for you.",

So is reading introductory material that's nonspecific, verbose, and has no immediate connection to something you actually care about. What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.Instead of thinking about \"all the cool stuff\", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first. But you don't need these smaller things to be completely unrelated to your project, which is however what you'll get by following standard tutorials.No one dreams of making \"hello world\", but even something incredibly complex can be turned into something simple by removing almost all of the details first. That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the \"real thing\".Even if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn. You need to find out and understand what you don't in order to get further, and you'll automatically know what to ignore (because it doesn't help you go in this direction).If you need specific examples, feel free to elaborate on your project ideas. But don't try to follow popular guidance if it isn't working. Most teachers, and the learning resources they create, are bad and won't work for a large proportion of students. There's no universal solution and no replacement for intrinsic motivation. If learning isn't fun on a regular basis, you'll struggle and not everyone can just \"power through\" until it \"gets fun\". That's not a failure, just a mismatch in strategy.The good news is that the beginning is by far the most difficult part of learning programming. Once you've attained some level of mastery, motivation comes much easier since being good at something is inherently rewarding.",

Build small, focused projects where you only practice one concept (e.g., a to-do app for CRUD, a weather app for API calls, a notes app with React state). Once you’ve done a few, you’ll naturally start connecting the dots and see which tool to use where.And don’t feel dumb if a colleague solves things faster, it’s just experience. With time, you’ll recognize patterns and solutions faster too. Keep building, break things down, and your speed/intuition will grow.",

And when a program runs in machine code, it becomes much, much simpler to understand how it calls other programs that are also in machine code. Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.But the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a \"calling convention\", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.Look into \"calling conventions\" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",

Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)If a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called. Different languages have different calling conventions.And when information is transferred over a network, that has its own problems. Often it's done with a text based format like JSON, but Protobufs are designed for the purpose. In the olden days, Sun invented XDR (eXternal Data Representation) and SunRPC, which did much the same thing but a lot less efficiently.In general we call this problem Serialization and Deserialization, and solutions to the problem have been introduced constantly for decades.",

If you don’t use the file system, but want to access data in memory, I.e. have a single app that is written in two or more languages, it gets very complex.

        "body": "It depends on what you mean by \"talk to each other\". Let's look at your example. Are you assuming that for Python to open a file, it needs to talk to C? It doesn't need to do that. Whatever underlying mechanism C uses to open a file, Python has that feature too.Yes, it's possible to have a language that doesn't have any features to open a file which means you're stuck unless you want to figure how to do it which might require rewriting parts of the compiler (or interpreter) for the language.Someone pointed out that Python can make foreign function calls to C. Python's weakness is that it's interpreted. Compared to languages like C, this makes it slow. You would think this would make Python and unlikely choice for doing math (which is computationally intensive), but because Python has this foreign function call specifically to C, then you can implement these numerical calculations in C, but let it be called like a standard Python library.But it's because Python has that feature built in. It doesn't have (as far as I know) a foreign function interface to, say, Erlang or Java.In general, languages don't have the capability to talk to each other directly.Someone pointed out that there is the front end (the browser side) and a back end (the server side), and that this is a way that two languages communicate. This is done indirectly, at least, if you're talking about a web browser.A front end is going to send a HTTP request which is a protocol to send information to a server. The server responds with that protocol. This means whatever language that front end is written in (Javascript is most common) has to eventually send an HTTP request. The back end needs to decode that request and then run some code in whatever language (there are numerous backend languages) then translate that to a response back to the client end.Two languages interact through HTTP, a protocol both sides understand. It's a little like someone who speaks Mandarin talking to someone who speaks Hindi by both speaking in English.One reason this happens is the front and back end are on separate machines with separate memory, so this requires some connection, namely, the Internet, and some way to communicate across this connection (HTTP which runs on top of TCP/IP).With Python calling a C function through a foreign language interface, then you're running code in the same memory space together. Again, it's a bit uncommon.You could have two languages communicate via a socket, which can be done via the same file system or via the Internet. You could invent a protocol to do this, but it wouldn't involve one language making a direct call in the other language, unless that was built into the language itself.Beginners often think languages talking to one another is cool and that it happens all the time, but it's not the way most people think.",

Its being able to reason about things. Break things down into manageable components. Id your entire idea is a simple manageable thing theres not much to break down.1. Set up linux on your pc/laptop.2. Set up neovim3. Add plugins to neovim to allow for things like LSP integration, autocomplete, formatting etc.4. Create a tcp server and tcp client in c++. You should be able to establish a connection between the two, enter data in the client, send the data to the server, read the data on the server, write it to standard output,send data back to the client, have the client read it the data and display it.Just 1 and 2 will improve you leaps and bounds.This will genuinely improve you more than you will ever know. You might not even understand any of what I just wrote. But thats the point. Thats the fun. Thats what makes SWEs, SWES. Our ability to break things down into the smallest possible parts, research each part, and come up with some solution, probably a terrible one, and then have the drive/ambition/desire to research/experiment how to improve that code you just wrote, before you ultimately realise you will always need to improve the code. And thats the fun. The best SWEs ive met, dont have 1000 functioning apps that have generated billions of pounds. They've just gone extremely deep into onr specific thing. For me its network, hence why I suggest a tcp server/client. I also think its the best project because thats what I honestly have found separates more advanced devs; the ability to understand things at a fundamental level. When you're coding, you're essentially just reading and writing data. But how is that data read/written?

They know how to use ser up a front and backend but not what really is going on. This project will force you to have to learn fundamental things.

I also worked as a “teacher” during other piscines, so I’ve seen both sides.For context: when I started the piscine I had **zero coding knowledge**. I didn’t even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.You’re *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that’s the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.The main things they look at are:* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.It’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.One last tip: **don’t measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn’t mean you’re behind. You’re on your own track.And yes, you’ll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone’s starting point is. Don’t let that get to you.",

I didn't understand shit, I felt really dumb and I didn't dare go to others for fear of exposing me as the ultimate idiot I felt I was. But as for my promo, everyone was really sweet and the more skilled didn't hesitate to make rounds to see if anybody needed a helping hand. Anyway, after that first week passed I kinda had a click. While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises I finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...). Really hoping it's enough to get accepted into the school, but in the meantime if you have any questions whatsoever feel free to ask away!",

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later onAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! Its very important that you have a good grasp on the “context” of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren’t aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.Last couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? What are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you’re supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?How comfortable are you getting with your current “ignorance” ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? And make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important oneMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb And have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

        "body": "OOP is basically mandatory to write good Java and honestly can help you greatly.The example I like to give is you have to start thinking of your program as different pieces that work together to accomplish a goal. As a piece gets too complex to keep track of, you want to look at good ways to break down what it does. Java sometimes goes too far with this in my opinion but it's a sensible premise to start from.It's fairly similar to how function design should be done. A function should do ideally one thing very well that takes a relatively small number of lines of code (though it might end up doing a couple of things honestly). But in OOP, we want to consider what those functions are usually working with and put all the similar functions into a class.For example, classic ATM design. You could build a deposit(account_no, amount) and withdraw(account_no, amount) function and just tie your UI into them. But note that there are a few complicated bits these functions will need to share. Both will need to access and update the database table for your bank account for example. Both primarily work on your account.So instead of functions, we can build one Account class which takes an account_no as a parameter to the constructor (ie an Account object is representing a specific class in the database) and has methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Since the Account object knows it's account_no already, there's no need to pass it in again. Likewise, imagine we'll have our database with multiple tables that we will need to access. They all share common tasks though like running a Select or an Update query. As we build out our application, we don't want to keep all this logic in every other object we make. So the Database itself can become an object which knows how to talk to the database. Then the Account can build one or be given one to work with.The ultimate goal is that every object knows everything it needs to know to operate and other things have to tell it as little as possible. The Database object doesn't need to know how bank accounts work, and the Account object doesn't need to know how the database work. They just need to know how to use what's called the interface: the way we intend for the object to be used by other objects (these are declared public in Java). This is the principle of cohesive class design - all the similar things are in one class and one class only.The nice part of this is if you swap how the database works, say from MySQL to Oracle, then you just have to redesign your Database object. Your Account object doesnt change at all. This is the idea of loose coupling - your objects rely on the public interface declared, not the internal workings of it.The best way is just to practice. Build object oriented applications and try to keep them cohesive and loosely coupled. You'll get better with practice.",

I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn’t something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I’m the rookie. The best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you’re out of your depth as OP says, you’ll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.From my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. Now I’m at a point in my career where I’m learning to “trust myself” that I do have those qualities. There isn’t one path but you should learn to trust yourself and gain confidence that you do have the ability to put in the work to make it happen.",

Ask it questions and study its responses. By approaching it from a standpoint of optimizing your current workflow, you can avoid some of the mental challenges that cause many people to give up. I know what this data looks like and what it means, I need it to look like this or I need to be able to use it in this way, or I need to get it into this app/platform. I would start with C# or Java.

The market is very over saturated and very competitive right now. For that reason, I would say \"program because you *like* programming and find it interesting, not because you want to make money doing it.\" If things change down the road, worry about it then.As far as advice:1. If you want to do **web design**, you'll want to start with the basics: **HTML and CSS**. Then get into **JavaScript**. Later on you might be interested in something like **TypeScript** or **React**.2. Alternatively, if you are doing a Masters degree in **data analytics**, I would encourage you to take a good look at **Python**, specifically **Pandas**. Other languages can work well too, but I know that Python is a common choice for data science type stuff; most programming languages *can* do what others do, but some are *designed* for certain tasks in mind.

Force yourself to think about how you would approach starting out, difficulties, do google searches, try things, maybe ask an AI as a last resort but with a very specific prompt that details what you have tried. When you eventually solve issues, it will feel much more rewarding like you solved a puzzle. This is what drives me personally, and when one is solved I keep building until the next issue, rinse repeat.

So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.Thing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.Either case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.Second - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.Third - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.Next - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.And here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.Finally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.FRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).DATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.BACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).BACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.BACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.Coding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).Side project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.So geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.Last word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.Good luck!",

Until one day they said \"Hey, you wanna weld?\" Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said \"HA...You messed that up.....fix it....\" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.This isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a \"senior dev\" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of \"real world skills\" vs book skills. Something I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). Download vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. Biggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say \"alright, I'm gassed\". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer \"I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen.\" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.This is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. Oh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap. That helps me with keeping my momentum up.",

More common, there have been a large number of people maintaining or enhancing the code and they all have different styles, even if there are strict standards from the company. Then, the code is difficult to understand unless they have commented well - here is an example: a1++; // increment countervs. max_error_count++; // Keep track of maximum errors detected during this transaction; vs. foobar++; a1 is a poor example, but foobar++; is worse. No comments, no intuitive name. max_error_count at least gives you some information and the comment helps. I've been called back to a company after 20+ years to work on code that is still running, and it's instantly recognizable to me what i wrote and what others have written - but it's all understandable because of documentation and comments.

        "body": "Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).I imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.Then I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.Silly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.So, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I \"hand off\" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).Obviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.Hint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",

We need to read the docs for plenty of things we use, and we forget little details all the time. The tools we use are designed to catch when we goof and tell us. (Though mileage varies: Languages like PHP and JS are kind of infamous for just guessing at what the programmer meant rather than tell them they need to be more clear.)",

It sounds like you have memorized solutions, and all of a sudden you see that it is no longer about memorizing a specific solution, but understanding what lies beneath, so you can write your own solution.If you draw the structure of a linked list, draw what happens when you insert a node, remove a node, add a node to the beginning vs the end, etc. writing pseudocode for what happens should be fairly straightforward. And translating that pseudocode to actual programming language is even simpler.But if you try to remember the solution in a specific programming language without having done the work prior, like you don't really understand the *what* and the *why*, but focus entirely on the *how* \\- they you'll have a very hard time. Look beyond programming languages, and try to learn what a linked list actually is, how operations are defined, and why they are that way. Then the programming will be way easier!",

Start by building a small stupid programme, like something that takes in user inputted numbers and prints them back out. Next, allow for multiple numbers to be entered, stored in an array. Then print the list of numbers afterwards. Then you can add operations inbetween numbers, this is more complex but teaches you how to separate a string using delimiters or whatever method you want to use. Add some functionality for operations, like add, subtract, etc. Just super basic stuff. Print out the answer and boom you have a calculator. This exercise will teach you the basics of how arrays, lists and stacks work, just experiment with different ways of storing numbers, from the common and basic, to the dumb and unique. Learn from failure, if your code doesnt work, it will tell you where, then you can try redo that part or try something else. If you ride a bike up a hill in the wrong gear, its hard, but after you learn how to change gears, it gets much easier, and you learn by doing",

It will also print the odd numbers - hm, okay, then you find out how to either check if a number is even or odd before printing it out, or somehow change the program so it skips the odd numbers in the list.Then you change it so it doesn't always go to 16, but to whatever number is input.Work backwards from the result towards the program that will create that result - \"fake\" parts of the program you don't yet know how to write, and always make sure that you have a running program that produces *some* result, even if it isn't the exact right one yet!Take small steps.Do not simply stare at the question and hope for a solution to appear in your mind, fully formed with all the details - it might happen occasionally with smaller tasks, but as the tasks get larger and larger, that process will fail!",

You may then write down the steps (on paper) as it would be instructions to a machine (still informal but with more details), work in itarations and make it more and more formal. This way you may express a problem with an informal text, transform the text into a set of informal \"instructions,\" and iterate the instructions to look more and more like a formal program. With experience, you can skip some of the steps, do some of them in your head, and you can fill in the blanks without much work (for some more difficult situations, it can still be useful to fall back to writing down problem statements by hand and twist and turn on the problem).",

We \\*can\\* for example just accept that it's \"all just zeros and ones\" and that is one way to look at it. However there \\*are\\* quite different ways we have to work with and encode textual data. Distinct from numbers. Distinct from Video or images. Some of this applies to some of your earlier thoughts. What I encourage you to try to do, is recognise that you are just discovering different ways to think about the same thing. Some of the answers (and indeed debates you are getting into) relate to people pointing out that you can look at it your original way in some context, or in a third way in others. This is really the useful skill. I've been around the block a bit and I can conceive of a relevant problem in terms of say, a functional programming solution or an object one or a procedural one. I can see how data might map onto Json or XML, or Yaml and how each might look and how to consider that. The OS for example is \"different than what us peasants use\", once you start getting into problems that deal with user space vs system space and so on. Some stuff the OS does \\*is\\* privileged and now you start to need to separate them again. The journey of seeing it as trivial, then understanding the complexity, then know how to abstract that complexity into something more trivial again ad nauseum, is something of a long one.",

This means minimal commenting, and certainly, not to the level of a beginner.Imagine you want to learn how to cook like a professional chef, but you're a total beginner. A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.Similarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.This is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.They have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.To be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.In effect you're saying> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.Most experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained. You don't have the ability to ask questions. What you really want is> I want to sit beside you and watch you code. I want you to have a running commentary telling me what you think. But as a beginner, I want you to explain all the steps you think are really obvious, hardly worth mentioning, and get into that, so I don't have to stop you and ask \"What are you doing now?\" a hundred times.",

You're calling different services, using dependency injection, and other stuff that isn't easy to understand if you're trying to take it in all at once. My recommendation would be to learn the basics of Python or JS, whichever you want, and then find a tutorial where you code along with the instructor while they build an actual project. If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. Good luck to you.",

Initially I don't have knowledge about reactjs, so I study read the basics of it. Then, they gave me access the repository to see what their source code looks like and to see what tools, libraries they used. Nobody explained to me about how the source code interact to each other, you need to dig deep and learn to read .similar to php, never done it and laravel for backend so I need to teach myself. So I guess, what I would suggest is that.. try to build something you are interested.. then, once you finish try looking on open source project similar what you did and analyze it and how they did it. Then, you could do the same. Try learning design patterns also .it is really useful and a lot of professional used it .",

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.I think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...And then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.Nowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.If you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

You need to figure out first what is it that you're truly interested in building and your choices will narrow down significantly. If you want to learn game development then you have C#, Python, C++, Lua and way more but C# is usually the best choice in that list and the most popular. Just by figuring out what you want to build, it will make the process of choosing a lot less overwhelming. After that, just pick any language you like or the one you think is the easiest, or the one you that's most used in the job market near you. For example, I like backend web development so I have a lot of choices but I picked JavaScript because I like the ecosystem and it's widely supported.If you like game development then just pick C# and stick with it and you will love it. Whatever scripts you want to make you can also use C# for that, it'll probably be a bit more verbose than Python but you can make scripts just fine with C#.",

A computer fundamentally is a very fancy calculator with one's code compiled into ADD, SUB, MUL, etc. And a function foo(bar) has its roots from mathematical f(x) functions.Math may not be a good measure but there is a high correlation.",

But you're not cooking yet.You are learning aspects of the language. The key is to get past that, be able to hear a simple problem, and figure out how to write code that accomplishes it.For the vast majority of things you can think of, you won't have any idea how to write code that does that.But for a few very simple tasks, you might be able to do that. For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.The goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show ---e----eThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.That's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.Currently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. I think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.As i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.Interesting read, thanks.",

        "body": "I think the biggest things I’d worry about when considering hiring a self-taught dev, especially from the sources you’ve mentioned, is how well rounded the person is in what they know about technology, and how much they know about the professional tooling of the trade.Basically, does this person know the first thing about how websites are actually hosted? Do they know anything about TCP/IP or DNS? Can they use Git/GitHub? Do they really appreciate what TypeScript gives us versus plain JavaScript? Do they have any sense of what React is actually doing under the hood that would let them debug an application. Considering the time commitment you say you are willing to dedicate I don’t think it’s unreasonable to recommend you use some of that time to read something like **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant, there is a pdf of it as the top result from Google. The hallmark of a self taught person on any subject is that they never learned the “boring parts”. Musicians who don’t know their keys and scales, programmers who don’t know what a subnet mask is or their algorithms and data structures. Also, you probably aren’t going to be able to just be a “front end developer” without a degree. If you work at a place that is happy to just have you work on React code and know nothing of the backend or operations or anything else, I would be surprised. I think you should expect to have to have at least superficial full stack knowledge. You should be able to set up a simple monolithic CRUD backend that can make simple SQL requests to a database using one of the following:- Express (JavaScript)- Django or Flask (Python)- Spring (Java)- ASP.NET (C#)Without credentials you’ll have to work much harder at developing a portfolio and this is going to be easier if your sites can have at least some backend functionality. This might all sound like a lot to do in one year, and that’s because it is. People do not usually go from zero to employed in a year, certainly not these days. Consider a two to three year time line at the minimum imo. Ensure that after you watch these YouTube videos you are then actually coding. If you aren’t able to go beyond what they are showing you in the video you aren’t really learning to code, it just feels like it. This is “tutorial hell”, and it’s what actually doing assignments in school is designed to get you through. Consider asking an AI to generate you a school assignments to practice based on what you’ve covered. Get comfortable with this website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ These are the closest thing to official documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gaining comfort in reading these will give you an important edge over other people. Don’t despair if it’s overwhelming at first, it all takes time.",

You can say you covered pretty much every basic of JS, but if you need to understand problems, fix errors and write code yourself without help, you need constant practice. For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). Just get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. JavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.You will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you), You can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)After you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

So there's minimal JavaScript programming language that just embedded in a browser engine. There's also a cli program called \"node.js\", it's JavaScript runtime that isn't tied to a browser. It works on the server side, it doesn't have many browser apis because it's not targeted for UI interactions on a webpage. The function that you pass to Promise constructor (executor) is running on the same UI thread so you don't do anything computationally heavy there, instead you can use Web Workers to emulate browser apis off ui thread code execution. While scripts are loading they're parsed but they only execute when the script is fully loaded and parsed, so heavy scripts would delay the web site users from being able to interact with the web page elements. Each JavaScript (e.g included with tag) is a separate program, if error occurs in one of a scripts it doesn't affect others (if no other scripts use functionality of that script). If you want to reference elements in a web page via JavaScript you need to make sure that the is fully loaded, otherwise you will get an error that you can't get elements by that id or class etc. You can also put the at the end of the so that when JavaScript will be executed it will know for sure that the body content is loaded, or you can put \"defer\" attribute to do the same without moving the script tag from . Relative url references that you pass to (e.g \"fetch\") aren't relative to the JavaScript file itself but to the html page that loaded that script. There's primitive types (numbers, bools, strings etc) and object types { } (Dictionary with special abilities)Learn the old way to make classes first, with function as a class constructor, function.prototype as a prototype object. Then learn the new syntactic sugar class definer, what i found out is the code inside it runs in strict mode.The closure and scopes is very important concept you need to learn. When i coded, the behaviour of variable declared with \"var\" escaping (being able to be accessed outside the scope) from a for loop is making a lot of problems, the variable declared with a \"let\" or \"const\" doesn't have the same problem.Watch @theavocoder animations explaining JavaScript event loop etc. The system behind callback invocations.",

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.For instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.The reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like: while (internalQueue.size() == 0) { wait(); }If you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.On the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.The solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.----If you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of: while (true) { synchronized (obj) { if (internalQueue.size() > 0) { // do stuff return; } } Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue }But no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most \"admired\" but only the 6th most \"desired\" language.As nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.Python is an \"easy\" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.JS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is \"click link, load page\" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",

Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. **Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it’s so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it’s being treated like that. It’s also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it’s long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. **Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you’ve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust’s Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that “invalid states are unrepresentable” at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It’s also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. Writing Rust can be painful, and it’s often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority. But if you already know Java/Kotlin those are both great languages, no reason not to just keep working on those since you already have a head start. Go is also another very popular language these days.",

But if you're able to solve a problem on paper, then you'll learn problem-solving. Programming consists of problem-solving (this step) and encoding the solution in code (the next one), among other things.Copying code does not teach you [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving). It doesn't even teach you the encoding step, though it may help to refresh your memory. Therefore you will not be able to learn how to solve problems, which is at the heart of programming.

Just a html file with a style section. Play around, stress the concepts you don't grasp. Make a todo list layout, make it look fancy to you.* Learn programming bare bones. No 3rd party libs at all. Just node and something you want to solve.* Learn server side bare bones. Use a web server package at most. Store your todo lists. Write them as json files on disk and load them back.* Learn browser JS bare bones. Just a html file with script section. Add fancy function to your todo list layout. Once you have all that it should become easier to bring everything together.",

See [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for when you need to serialize them into strings. That way, you never have to worry about it, and you can just convert them to whatever your local timezone is when displaying them.Most databases have a timezone-aware timestamp column type, in which case it'll take care of all of the complexity under the hood. Don't worry about efficiency; databases are very good about handling that efficiently and you won't run into performance issues unless you're dealing with *massive* quantities of data.",

If you want to schedule an event at a future time, using UTC can result in the wrong local time, when timezone rules change (and that happens frequently around the world):[https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting\\_future\\_datetimes.html](https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)But even outside of that, a universal \"prefer UTC\" rule doesn't work for every case. It sounds like for your particular app, you care most about the day in which something happened, according to the person who did an action on that day. The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.There's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.That would make finding all events on a particular day trivial. The only tricky thing might be if someone traveled across time zones in one day, but it would still handle that just fine. Everything would still be stored relative to the local day.",

Then, whenever you do a lookup or a calculation, you need to do so using the timezone rules of whenever the event was scheduled.",

Especially if you've got experience in other languages that stands up to scrutiny.To be honest, I'd expect it to have the opposite effect. Knowing C suggests you potentially have a better understanding than many applicants on the underlying structure of programming languages, and that you're familiar with multiple languages that are quite different. Additionally, it shows you're able to pick the correct tool for the job, rather than just forcing a less-good language in.I'd be far more interested in hiring someone who knew JS/TS/C and a little bit of Rust/Golang, than the millions of people with JS/Python/PHP.Additionally, for older languages, where there are less people using them, critical infrastructure still relies on them, with a smaller pool of applicants. The actual specifics of what you're working on as part of your job may be less interesting, but the money will likely be better.",

Python is ubiquitous these days, and very big in data science and machine learning. But it’s more general purpose than the others, so you might have to dig more to figure out how to do what you want. AWK and R do that stuff all day long.You could probably do what you want just using shell commands. But if you want to do the same thing more than once with different data, you’ll want to put those commands in a shell script, so boom — you’re back to programming. And shell scripting is kind of horrible.Go to your campus library and borrow *The AWK Programming Language*. You’ll be writing small data filters in a a few hours.",

I'd say it'd take the average person a few months to learn enough to be able to do this. A perfect book for this would be: [https://automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)I can't think of any way to do it without writing code. That doesn't mean it's \"impossible\", but the stuff you're asking for is really specific, and you'd have to find some tool that somebody else has already written that does the exact steps you want.If you don't want to spend a few months learning to code, I think your options are either hiring a freelancer or using AI.I think what you'll find with those approaches is that what you're asking for isn't necessarily that hard, but specifying EXACTLY what you want it to do is actually harder than you think. Your descriptions are decent but the devil is in the details.Here's a good way to think about it: if you gave your instructions to ten average college students and asked them to MANUALLY follow your steps, do you think they'd all get the same result? If not, then if you asked someone to write a program to execute your steps then there are multiple valid ways to interpret your instructions and you might not get what you want.I do have one question for you: do you have a strong preference for where this transformation should happen? You mentioned the word \"column\" - are you using Excel right now? Does this program need to work with your Excel spreadsheet or could it work with text files?",

The most commonly used ones are:**signal**Provides the function sgolayfilt(), which directly applies a Savitzky–Golay filter.~~~install.packages(\"signal\")library(signal)# Example: smoothing with a Savitzky–Golay filterx <- 1:100y <- sin(x/10) + rnorm(100, sd=0.1)y_sg <- sgolayfilt(y, p = 3, n = 11) # p=polynomial order, n=filter lengthplot(x, y, type=\"l\", col=\"grey\")lines(x, y_sg, col=\"red\", lwd=2)~~~**pracma**Has sgolay() for generating coefficients, and you can apply them with convolution.~~~install.packages(\"pracma\")library(pracma)coeffs <- sgolay(p = 3, n = 11)# coeffs contains the filter coefficients~~~**prospectr**Offers savitzkyGolay() specifically tailored for spectroscopic data.~~~install.packages(\"prospectr\")library(prospectr)y_sg <- savitzkyGolay(y, m = 0, p = 3, w = 11) # m=derivative order, p=polynomial order, w=window size~~~**Summary**- If you just want a drop-in smoothing filter, the signal::sgolayfilt() function is the most straightforward.- If you’re working with spectroscopy or chemometrics, prospectr::savitzkyGolay() is often used.",

Personally if I were trying to solve a real problem like that I would look to see if a library were available and to use that.That said, I personally don't think Simpson's Rule ought to be hard for a programmer to understand, but if I look at typical explanations, e.g. in Wikipedia, something about the delivery of the explanation, with lots of mathematical symbols and so on -- tends to make my eyes glaze over. If I were basing this on the Wikipedia explanation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s\\_rule), I would start with the \"**Approximating the natural logarithm of 2**\" example listed there (that is easy to follow) and once that one makes sense (and once I'd written a simple program to calculate it that way), I would work backwards to make it work with the \"general composite 1/3 Simpson's rule\", for example. At that point you should basically have computer code that is a computer version of what the Wikipedia article is telling you.If SICP has a \"mathematical background\" section in the appendix, I would try reading that first and then representing all of the notation as code as a sort of \"translation\".",

In my honest and humble opinion,  Android (and jetpack compose in particular), is more pleasant and less nerve wreaking than iOs.Cross platform: welcome to the jungle! Cross or multi platform developer is gaining in popularity,  mainly because management can save a buck. There's so many frameworks available out there, it's difficult to decide,  but here's my 2 cents:- no-no: Qt framework, Xamarin, Ionic, React Native. Developer experience and overall quality is plain bad.- maybe: Kotlin Multi Platform. It's in its early stages,  and rough around the edges, but I see huge potential. - best option: Flutter. For so many reasons, let me know if you want to know more.At the end of the day, they all work in the same way: your code transpiles to cpp and h, and these are compiled vis cmake. Hence,  you may as well create your own. Worth mentioning: mobile development is not just \"the app\", but the release train as well:- github workflows- fastlane- google play, apple dev portal and store connect- certificates and permissions (see in app purchases, keypass auth, etc etc)Let me know if I can help you further. Edit: I forgot to mention something very important,  that will help you succeed as an engineer,  and not just a developer: architecture. Learn as much as possible about that. Most principles con be transferred to backend development,  and even lower level programming. Read other people's code. When you do it for work it's draining, but when it's not is like learning from the masters. I recently dissected Arduino CLI, for instance,  and I discovered a gem of clarity an structure.

I actually hated it hahaha. But Kotlin and Native apps were more popular than cross-platforms libraries back then.Now 2025, I'm a L4 mobile app developer with React Native as a lot of companies moved from native code to React Native apps.From my above experience, starting with SPA and Apache Cordoba (or any other hybrid app solution) is a great start to how mobile apps are compiled.From there I would suggest React Native.Learning Kotlin or Swift is a plus, but not mandatory.Also, perhaps a bit of Flutter would be a great too!",

By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.As for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

That's my process, and it's been working out so far, lowest grade in my CS courses have been an A- Best of luck! Hmu if you got questions :)",

I felt with #1 and #2 I was spending too much time trying to get the diagrams/sketches/code blocks \"perfect\" and was less focused on the material itself. I would print out the lecture notes/slides before the class (this assumes your professor makes them available to you beforehand), and annotate those notes. If I needed more space for code/examples, I'd use loose leaf paper. I'd then put all that together in a 3-ring binder. This came in especially handy for my DSA final exam which was open book (paper only; no electronics). I had all kinds of annotations that were basically answers to the the multiple-choice questions. It just depends on your learning style. For me, the physical act of writing helps me retain the information better than typing or even writing on the iPad. But then again, I'm 40 so I grew up not really having the digital options we have now.",

        "body": "Most of the other answers in this thread are wrong.Some people are saying that the addresses are different because forking creates a new address space. That doesn't explain the output because the new address space has new *physical* memory mappings for the same *virtual* address space, and the address you're printing is a virtual address. Userspace programs can't (easily) see physical addresses at all; they only see virtual addresses.Some people are saying this is due to address space randomization. That's wrong because ASLR doesn't change any of the virtual addresses in a forked process. (Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.The answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.Your code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the \"if\" branch, and `c` and `d` in the \"else\" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.More precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.If you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1dBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",

Nevertheless, even if you were using InterProcess (IPC) shared memory, where the underlying physical memory would be the same for both processes, they would still have different virtual addresses, since in general mmap won't map to the same virtual addresses the underlying physical memory region on both processes (unless explicitly requested to mmap to the same specific virtual addresses on both processes).",

There are no strict rules, but rather best-practices and different perspectives (product vs dev vs devops).**The rule of thumb:** Commit logically related changes together, not necessarily file by file.**There are strategies based on scope:****- Feature-based commits:** If your work package (feature, bug fix, whatever) is done with just 1 file, you should commit it.**- Progressive commits:** if your feature needs more files, you should commit in different steps (it can be finished or unfinished). This lets you track progress incrementally, create rollback points, and makes code reviews way easier.You can also use story points as milestones. Like a 1-point story = one commit, but a 5-point story gets broken into multiple commits as you build the feature.Example:* Simple bug fix (1 file) → feature-based commit* User auth system (tons of files) → progressive commits: model → service → UI → integrationThis way you match your commit strategy to the actual complexity instead of being rigid about it.",

For example understanding polymorphism in oop is common sticking point as many junior programmers don't see the benefit of have a generic interface that you can overwrite the methods on they will just write the same function in multiple different classes and it's not until they need a generic method that they realise.TL;DR I think it's ok to recommend kotlin but you might need to hold their hands a little bit",

Fill in the stubs.This works nicely because the IDE recognizes my docs and offers autocomplete and other hints, the stuff Microsoft calls “intellisense” when I, or others, are trying to use my code.And, there are workflows that extract that kind of doc into separate documentation objects. In my experience those workflows are hilariously hard to use, but so what? My use of the docs is via the IDE. ( I’m a JetBrains fanboi, but VS, VSCode, and Eclipse do this too.)This is good for portfolio stuff.

Once you finish something, start over from a completely blank slate (not a half-blank slate), and do it again. Then, do it again. Then, do it again in a day, then in a few more days.Each time, you'll probably encounter different bugs or issues, but it will slowly start to feel more comfortable, and be easier, each time, and you'll gradually get a deeper understanding of what you're doing.",

Unions don't prevent things like offshoring and very likely change the calculus toward offshoring as it becomes more of a pita to deal with the union. They won't protect against automation. You can put baricades to people being fired but I've seen the real life consequences of that where you have people that do nothing and still cant be fired for ages which is not conducive to having high performing, efficient teams. Pay? There is a reason that other than guaranteeing minimum pay, continuing insurance on injury etc, sports unions have nothing to do with negotiating pay. The whole point of unions is that everyone gets paid \"fairly\" which usually means the same for given seniority. The groups where unions have made a significant difference in pay like nurses for instance, had extreme leverage (a lack of even remedially qualified replacements, and the requirement that duties are performed onsite). Unions just arent a great fit for tech jobs, especially with the increased ease of offshoring.",

Cloud is where things are a bit harder go learn but theres free tiers, just gotta make sure you dont do silly things and end up blowing past the free tier limits. In AWS land I would try to build some demo apps leveraging some of the core AWS services like S3, SQS, EC2.I wouldnt expect a newgrad to be an expert in any of these but any experience would surely be valuable.I highly recommend reading docs on the design and architecture of these systems, that is to me more valuable than learning some APIs. If you understand how Kafka works and when to use it, why it gives you the guarantees that it gives you and so on, that will make you a valuable member of the team from day one.Good luck!",

Like realistically, most fresh out of high school students have never had to use any of those technologies let alone make projects with it.It wasn’t until I realized they just want you to be familiar with it.

No outsourcing either, but increasing workload for those remaining while wages are stagnating.In the next 2-3 years, our seniors will leave, that's roughly 40% of our workforce and there are no replacements; with our specific skill set, we need at least three years of training. You can imagine how that will end. I'm already looking for something else because without enough staff we can't run projects, and without projects we are going to bleed dry quickly, as costs of operations are high.In general, less companies properly invest in junior talent, they just looking at short term value extraction, then move on to the next opportunity to exploit. Or just stick with their current workforce and try to remain as profitable as possible without blatantly violating labor laws.I honestly don't know what's wrong, it's like people in charge had their brains fried during COVID or something.",

Keep applying, set up alerts so you're one of the first applicants to a role rather than the 1000th, your chances go way up.Try to apply for things more out of your comfort zone because it may be that your skill set/tech stack is too common which means a lot of competition - if that's the case what feels uncomfortable for you may be uncomfortable for other applicants too. Do what you have to do to survive, I had to sell some investments to stay afloat.Yes it is very demoralizing, it was my first time being laid off and I didn't realize how much of my feeling of self worth was tied to gainful employment prior to that, the depression sucked, but after some soul searching and figuring out what I actually wanted to pursue and what I would be good at, I took on other things that gave me purpose. I used my free time to volunteer for causes that were important to me, and I got to build some APIs that helped streamers fundraise for Planned Parenthood (we ended up raising over $60k grassroots) and eventually it was this project that landed me a role at a large nonprofit where I currently work. It's funny because I didn't do it with the purpose of landing a job, I legitimately just wanted to help out the cause and later when I found a nonprofit job posting that matched my skillset I realized it would be very relevant to them and I'm pretty sure that's what set me apart from the other candidates.",

It was how they were able to compete in the talent war.Those are the companies I expect to continue being hybrid/remote into the future. The ones that *need* it to attract and keep talent.

        "body": "Economist here. Lots of misconception about things like full employment and your nubers are wrong.Unemployment rate which is people who are actively looing for work and do not have any work is the sum of three different kinds of unemployment: frictional, structural and cyclical. These can each be defined as follows:* Frictional - labor market entry unemployment. This is essentially people like new grads, career break people, voluntary job quitters re-entering the workforce.* Structural - People who lost jobs due to structura changes specific sectors i.e. AI wiping out whole job categories is a form of structural unemployment.* Cyclical - Unemployment due to movemetns in the business cycles (recessions/expansions) this is the one part of unemployment rate that can be negative.Natural Rate of Unemployment a.k.a. non-cyclical unemployment a.k.a. full employment level of unemployment a.k.a Non-Accelerating Inflation level of Unemployment rate is when you have zero cyclical unemployment. That is Natural Rate = Structural + Frictional Unemployment. The government estimates this number its been trending down over time:[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU)This number has been tredning downwards since the 1970s nd right now its around 4.3 percent. This suggests we are rigth at full employment and any higher we are going to have a positive cyclical unemployment rate.From 2021 through 2023 we essentially had unemployment rate lower than the NAIRU meaning we had negative cyclical unemployment rate. That number has been gradually climbing towards the NAIRU through 2024 and if it keep growing we will have positive cylical unemployment (meaning unemployment because the economy isn't doing well).[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)Now why is this Sub-reddit going to feel worse.1. Its clear something is happening with frictional unemployment rate. New College grades are having a harder time finding a job compared to anytime other than a out right recession. Some of it might be AI effecting entry level jobs etc. AI might make it harder to screen legitimate candidates. It might mean less entry level demand etc. This is not the same thing as cylical unemployment because the assumption is that this is some kind of shift in full employment rate that is unlikely to go away if the economy is doing well.2. There is some degree of structural unemployment in tech. Tech overhired inthe pandemic. Take google: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees) They increased head count by 60 percent after the pandemic. They have now laid off about 10000 workers, but they still ahve 50 percent more workers than they did in 2019. Job posting rate on indeed indicates other companies did the same. Notice there were over 2 times more listings in the end of 2021 as there was before pandemic. Now in 2025 its about 60 percent of the pre-pandemic level.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)3. For young workers the job market feels worse, because people who graduated in 2024 or 2025, missed what was probably the best job market for all workers in decades, especially for tech. The last time the job market was this good for workers was probably in the 1990s. This means the people graduating now unfortunately are entering a world where the job market is getting worse and watched the people that graduate 1 to 2 years ahead of them enter the best job markets ever.Anyway I do think we are entering a recession. But the problem with recessions is that we don't officially know we are in a recession until after we are alrady in one. It tkaes at least 6 months of negative GDP growth for the NBER to decide if we are in a recession. That means given the current environment the earliest NBER would declare recession is the beginning of April of 2026. Just for all you Gen Z kids, an economy exiting an actual recession doesn't mean the job market will get better. The 2008 recession ended by end of 2009, the unemployment kept rising for another year and took 6 years for the job market to get to the pre-recession levels. Meaning if you graduated college in 2009, you didn't see a job market better than before the recession until 2016. I can't predict if the next recession will be as severe as 2008 (hopefully not), but buckle up kids.",

You don't want to come off as misleading to the company, and maybe they'll be OK with a tech lead instead of a manager if you ask.If the company's really gonna be a stickler about a manager as a reference, your tech lead probably won't fly. Yes tech leads are the people SWE's work closest with, but they're not people managers at the end of the day. If they call them, they're going to ask a lot of manager-oriented questions... probably including directly asking \"Were you X's direct manager?\" In which case your tech lead would need to both be comfortable lying for you, and good at lying.Definitely don't ask someone for a reference that you don't know for a fact would give you a positive reference. So 1's not an option.I'd personally do 3. And I have done 3 several times in the past.The fact I don't keep in touch and grab beers with my ex-managers doesn't mean our professional relationship disintegrates. We both still worked together, we both still have memories of each other, and we're both still professional connections.Put another way, if your ex-manager reached out *to you*, wouldn't you be happy to give them a reference? Why would they feel any differently?My last job search I used a manager from 2 companies ago that I hadn't spoken a word to in 3 years. He was thrilled to give me a reference. We had a great working relationship. We don't keep in touch because we have different jobs now, our own families, our own friends... but our professional connection is still there.The job search before that I reached out to a manager I haven't spoken to in 2 years.

Same thing with all online job board applications with such features. Companies hire recruiters to shift through all these garbage resumes and many were fed up, think it is much more efficient use of their time to just find someone qualified on LinkedIn, lives in US of A, and reach out to them.",

        "body": "Corporate Tech Recruiter here. There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP’s question First, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate. Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients. Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and onlywork on openings for that companyAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages. They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need. LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get tractionCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective. We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects. Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.So why are you getting tons of pings when you haven’t engaged with your LI profile? Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you’ve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).Personally as a corporate recruiter, I’m only reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match. But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements. From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience. Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.I understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

I studied CS, but funny enough, I ended up getting more interviews for hardware related roles than my peers with more hardware centric degrees. —-1. The pay is higher IMO2. You don’t have to stress about learning the latest web technologies3. While there might not be as many jobs available, you’re also competing with a lot less people too (multiple orders of magnitude less). The pool of talent is also getting smaller (and older)4. Your coworkers may be on the older side. That can be good for a mentorship, but also it can be hard to change some of their ways5. You may end up working with much older technology. Which is cool, but also a pain at times. Don’t ever be worried about feeling out of date honestly6.

I've written production code in several languages, mostly Haskell, with a little Python, Rails, and Typescript, and I find SpringBoot really efficient. It's the type of framework where good practices are a pit that you basically fall into by doing things the conventional way. Lots of people rail on Java, espeically the Haskell programmers and the Rust community, but a language like Haskell is a major pain to set up, since there's a million ways to do things, and even though there are plenty of libraries, each has like 5-10 stars on github. Even with Rust, it's not worth it to spend your time on such complexity, when the benefit of better speed or type safety can be mitigated in other ways.",

It takes a lot more money piled up to retire than most people realise.A veteran cs worker, for example, earning say $300k a year would need to have more than $4M in earning assets ( so their main home does not count ) - minimum, to keep their income at the current level. - let alone they are giving up future income growth. We, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it’s far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. And the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year… it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. I once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited. I don’t know his exact net worth, but his payout was somewhere between $10-$20M He was working with us a senior dev, earning like $200k. I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. - he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. - this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. - it gave him a sense of purpose. He was motivated, despite not ‘needing the job’ worked just as hard as anyone else. In short he enjoyed working and helping others, but had decided that he did not want the stress of being responsible for managing or paying others.",

A good amount of people have AI slop for resumes, so we maybe open 150 of them to find what we need. Basically every single person seems just as- or less qualified than the next guy applying. Everyone is a dev who has built something “scalable and unique and distributed to make some impact on xyz” yata yata. 99% of people use the same line. If you got AI writing vague stuff for you, it only takes reading about half a sentence before we close it and open the next resume. We got 7000 apps, so anything even somewhat weird underwhelming or questionable is getting your app closed.Write something meaningful. We don’t want be left to have to wonder what you actually did at your role. Doesn’t help you that we can just hire Indian devs for $4/hr lol. They’re really bad, and I personally ALWAYS advocate for USA only… but my boss already had us pick up 10 Indians for the price of one (CHEAP) USA dev… which is a complete pain in the ass if I’m being honest. I hate it, but the VPs love it for “cost savings”.I manage 10 MORE mfs to only get 1.2x more tasks done from one US dev.. I have to make a ton of tiny tickets, the daily standup is one fucking hour long, and everything is constantly delayed… all in the name of “efficiency” and the idea that they should get better eventually. I fear our two current open roles will be the last US dev hires for a long time. Thank globalization for the fact that Defense and Finance are the only dev roles with US job security (anything needing security clearance).Even I worry being outsourced in the next 5 years once these dudes actually get decent at coding. Remote labor compensation is unfortunately a race to the bottom now. It ain’t like the old days. :face_exhaling:There’s easier money in construction work lol my advice? Become an electrician and start your own business. The CS Dev industry will be completely screwed for USA workers in like 5 yr. Already is screwed. If you’re not in it now with a few years of experience, tbh I’m not sure how you will get in. Wishing you luck",

That time is golden because you still have a job, so in the future if it happens again take the initiative to immediately interview. Never ever wait to start interviewing.In some companies you might be able to survive a PIP but from what I've seen it's like a lottery. I know someone wins the lottery but I've never actually seen anyone win it - and I've never seen anyone survive a PIP in the industry. The PIP is the company being nice and giving you a heads up that you're fired. Take the hint.Second, absolutely don't discuss the PIP in future interviews. I don't care what you say but don't say that. It would be better to say you got into a fist fight over text editors rather than you got let go because of a PIP. Personally if they ask I would say that unfortunately they shrunk the team size. Think like a politician.Your first gig is the hardest to get! You've got experience now get that next gig. Good luck!",

If a company outright lays you off and hires someone else to fill your position without offering it back to you, you could have a case against them. A PIP is their way to get rid of you and not have to hire you back.You don't have to explain to future companies that you were on a PIP.

I wouldn't progress a candidate forward that did this. I'd prod them during the interview to hopefully get them speaking in case they were just nervous... but if that doesn't work, and the whole interview goes by without them explaining their thought process, running through examples, verifying their work, etc.... I'm not passing that person. \"Correct\" answer or not.I've passed plenty of people that did really good on communicating during the solving process, but didn't quite get the right solution, or got the naive solution. It's the solving process I'm paying attention to the most.The knowledge section doesn't really jump out as suspicious to me... that sounds about right. When I'm not in interviewing shape, I usually can't just rattle off SOLID despite using its concepts daily. But when I'm interviewing, you can bet your ass I can rattle off a textbook definition of SOLID, because I prepare.During the knowledge section do you have a script you need to stick to? Couldn't you dig into asking for some examples, or to explain why they think that's the right answer, or explain alternatives? Ideally you want ways to gauge understanding beyond reading off a textbook answer, because memorizing SOLID is trivial. Understanding it is what you're looking for.The raw dogging is suspicious.... but without being there, and without being able to ask them deeper questions myself, I couldn't say if they're cheating one way or the other.",

Which, as a startup, your company might not have. Even if it has it, it might still have written rules what you can submit to it and often any kind of company owned IP should not go into such services, as well as PII etc…So, your company might have freaked out simply over you using non-sanctioned service and submitting any company information to it. That is legit.Does the company develop bullshit crappy software? Well that’s what 90% of startups do. More established companies (as in non-startup) at least passed the market test so even if they do the same they have proved that there is some market for what they are offering out there. This is where your gut feeling and information you’ve learned might be right but also - that’s startup life for you. Very few of startups (like way less than 1%) are future Googles, and many of those which survive long enough to become publicly traded are more like Enron really.",

If you don't get fired learn from this lesson. You have to be very careful at companies with what you do with their data. Startups probably don't define their data handling practices well, but larger more established companies will. Ideally you'll be making more money at those companies and want to avoid job loss. If you didn't submit the data into AI then your boss is just being unreasonable.In short find out what sanctioned tools (AI or otherwise) you can use on the job with company data before you do something that will get you fired. In some aspects you are lucky as a new grad that you can just omit this job from your resume if you get fired. In other aspects you aren't because it would be setting your resume back to 0 post college experience.Good luck",

This could be tough and depends on your luck, the area, and if they are willing to take a risk. I did this route and was paid pennies lmao. But it gave me talking points during interviews and helped me embellish my resume. This is definitely better than putting some random job to prevent resume gap.Overall, I don't know how recent your grad graduated but for like the first 6 months or so, my suggestion is to keep on practicing for interviews and try to be the first few applicants and apply asap to new grad roles, tdp roles, and other rotational programs and hope that ATS doesn't screen his resume out. Then, all he has to do is not fuck up the interviews which is basically leetcode and behavioral like I did and he's in.If that doesn't work out, then I think you really have to consider either masters or find other job like I did.Hope this helps",

Have them optimize their resume a bit more with what they already have, like school projects and any potential club experiences, and also do interview prep so if they get interviews they will be able to make it through.Also tell them to treat applying/making themselves marketable to be a full time job (1-2 hours a day applying, 1-2 hours a day leetcode/interview prep, 4 hours a day working on a marketable startup idea or open source content).",

One of the employees had health issues and the HR burden around that situation consumed probably 25% of my time working. And frankly the review/bonus system that was in place at this particular employer required me to give my employees reviews I didn’t feel were fair.So during a reorg I asked to be transferred to a non-managerial role. They agreed, and I became a Consulting Engineer. Technically the same pay level as a manager, but seen as a technical leader of sorts and without the HR responsibility. The downside is the opportunity to earn fat bonuses was also substantially reduced, but overall great move for my personal sanity.The biggest lesson I learned?? Being a manager can be a ton of fun if you have a great team. If you don’t have a great team then it’s essentially the opposite of fun.",

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.This is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. No one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.This speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. It's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better. If you're constantly bumbling into the same problems, constantly asking the same question, and constantly not able to get work finished, then you might have a motivation issue.",

As others have said, you're just starting mid to senior engineering roles, that's a lot more responsibility and requires a different mindset. Are there some things you could be doing better? Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? I went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard. But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well. Over time I realized that, while I have made mistakes, a lot of the issues I had were systemic and involved me to build the environment I wanted to work in. Just something to think about. Hang in there.EDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months. Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you. Again, I don't know you and I don't know your work ethic, so I can't say that you're perfect or anything, but anecdotally, and based off of what I've read, that's just what it seems like.",

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn’t go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.You can’t expect every line of code you’ve wrote and decision you’ve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That’s an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.Personally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they’re small.When you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you’re pretty much asking for every subpar decision you’ve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.Ask for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.Edit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he’s seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying “looks good” or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you’re writing which takes some of the pressure off.",

We started doing stack ranking and below meet expectations quota for performance review last year, “following examples set by faang in the industry”. Was very chill before last year’s changeRemote: we probably will stay remote forever but some teams require you to ge in close proximity of an office and may need you to go in once a week or two weeks, not mandatory tho. It’s mostly for team bonding and not flying everyone everytime. We don’t have enough desks in office so theres no chance we ever do hybrid or full rto. The teams that culturally go into office more often do not go in more than once a week, and no one cares if you only show up once a quarter or smthing. The obly thing here is if a manager goes into office then during hiring they may prefer you to be the same location.Benefits: faang level or better. Free lunch. Wellness fund to spend on fitness/learning. 401k matches, most general holiday schedule ive seen (yea random holidays we get a day off where other companies are working), unlimited pto with no need for request unless out for 3 weeks.Comp: im not a SWE (I work on ML so we get paid on a different scale) so can’t comment too much. But i think we are FAANG level or better. On levels fyi we are consistently ranked top 10-30 most well paid companies. It’s very front loaded stock vest so first year or two will absolutely beat equivalent of google/meta/whatever, but it may cliff fast later on if you don’t perform well. So do well on performance reviews or try to get promo is your best bet to keep refreshers high.Company: We are founded by ex google engineers and we are a tech first company meaning we pride ourselves in extremely innovative algorithms, scalable infra, SOTA ML (we publish a lot in top ml research conferences for a company our size). We are fundamentally different from other companies of similar or bigger size (e.g. etsy, ebay, etc) which do not care as much about their tech.Leadership: can’t comment on details. We are founded by ex googlers, but cofounder left the company recent years. Now VPs and C Suite (CEO is ex Google shopping VP) is all ex google burecrates who are more wallstreet persona supposedly. Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc but new initiatives are being explored (or is it just wallstreet milking us? We never know)But like others said: we are very hard to get an offer from (i feel like we are more picku than google sometimes). We mostly only hire ex faangs or equivalent. Even ex faangs get denied without interviews all the time. So try to get into the loop first and dont set expectations too high",

People with impostor syndrome always downplay their achievements and layer it with nuances of why its not perfect etc. That will end up biting you. If you're not content with something, it gives everyone else an excuse to not be happy with it. Learn to be proud of your achievements.If this doesn't vibe with you, my biggest advice is just leave big tech. There are many types of organizations that are much suited for your personality and you just need to find the right fit. If you can't find something that fits you, then you'd have to change yourself to fit it. The latter has always been a challenge in my 20 year career as well.",

The guy they hired didn’t have any work experience or a degree (I knew him since we went to college), but he was friends with the team manager.Moral of the story, in this job market, having credentials, a nice resume, work experience etc can definitely help but networking is a huge part of landing a job. Go to job fairs, conferences, reach out to people on LinkedIn (I barf saying that but it helps), reach out to prev uni teachers, etc.Last thing I’ll add, is that looking for a six figure salary job is also gonna make it super difficulty. Engineers are everywhere now in a super saturated market bc we’ve all been fed the same story of engineers being needed and it paying well for 20 years. If you can find a decent salary even if it’s below what a “entry level engineer” should make, don’t be afraid to still apply. It sucks but it’s how you get experience and the potential to move up.",

This is a very valuable experience. Part of being experienced is having an intuition about what wouldn't work, or what would come back and bite you in future. Now you know what'd happen if you let the codebase deteriorate. It's very likely that other developers are not happy with the codebase either so I'd suggest getting other people onboard with a refactoring effort starting with creating a decent test suite to give you confidence to refactor. As much as I hate the hype, AI is amazing when comes to disecting/explaining the code and writing tests. And if you manage to do this, you'd have a HUGE success story.I'm yet to met someone who's happy with their codebase tbh.",

How do we fit into our org structure and what unique thing do we provide? That’s not how businesses measure it. They’re measuring against a near mythical candidate; someone with perfect soft skills, elite software skills that have no limitations, who can work across the entire stack effortlessly and complete all tasks without _any_ additional guidance from anyoneSo imagine a company hires a new engineer named Sarah. They tell Sarah to do a task that might be out of her expertise. She might say she’s not sure if she has enough background in that tech to solve the problem. This is a mark against her, as this mythical software engineer would never say that. The mythical software engineer would simply do it without question. So, she tries to do it, but it takes longer than the leadership expected. Now, again, despite the fact that Sarah maybe did work really hard on this to get it done, they’re measuring against a mythical software engineer and judge her performance to be bad. Why don’t we just fire her and hire a new engineer who _might_ be this mythical engineer we want?It’s like dating apps. When you have a literal endless list of people to choose from, you can be quick to dismiss people who might be good matches for flagrant reasons. “Yeah sure, she’s pretty, she’s nice, and she has a good personality… but I’d really prefer a brunette, next!”. As we know, this leads to a really toxic culture where no one is satisfied and everyone is neurotic",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.Those inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild. Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.If your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.The key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.Get your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.Having scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.Chill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.I have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.Well, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.I ghosted them.

Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere. Any prospective employer will ask for permission before contacting your current employer, so really they should have no way of knowing unless you're publicly posting about it. Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.Do not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter.

Not too long after I got a much larger bump up to 89k and it just steadily increased from there. Granted, good developers were difficult for them to find (and keep) in the very early 2020s so I think that pressured them to preemptively up my salary even though I didn’t have another offer at the time. I also have since been promoted to senior, so that bumped my salary too.Overall, your situation and the labor market is going to play a major role in your pay imo. If you have known and visible work you can show off to management and they feel you might jump ship, that’s going to be the primary ingredients for higher salary. With how the developer job market is now, I’d guess you’ll probably need an offer elsewhere to get a notable pay bump at your current position.",

The job wasn't really an SWE position either, was some kind of weird support gig that was supposed to lead to one.Second layoff was June 2018, after several hops and it was the first startup I ever worked for. Landed my next job exactly a month after being laid off, like to the day. Got back into SWE full time in 2012 so at this point I had about 6 years of experience. The full interview process took about 2 weeks.Third layoff was in February 2023 and also only took about a month. VP told a bunch of us about a colleague of his that was hiring, I recognized the name as a recruiter I connected with at a conference about five years earlier. Pinged the recruiter on LinkedIn and got in the mix quickly. This one took about 1.5 to 2 weeks.Fourth layoff was October 2024, and it took about a month to land my current gig. Went to a local user group meeting I hadn't been to in a couple years, which was having its first meeting in the offices of the place I now work for, also their last meeting of the year. One of their staff engineers was present and ended up sitting next to me. Struck up a brief conversation with him, we connected via LinkedIn, and I sent him my resume the following Monday. Took about two weeks from submitting my resume to getting the offer.",

Nobody’s gonna grill you about Go’s <-, but stuff like Java volatile or synchronized do come up.If you want to go for Go jobs, you’ll want to be well rounded: a solid T shaped skill set, good DS&A, end-to-end understanding of system design, ability to pick multiple languages quickly.",

Not every company has a microservice architecture where you can choose to simply write a new feature in Go.On the other hand a lot of what would formerly be written in Java if the project is greenfield Go is becoming very popular. I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go. The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it. So its become more attractive in that sphere. If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.So basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on. Luckily Go is a fairly tiny language (which honestly gets people in trouble because they become expert beginners in it very quickly) so its pretty quick to learn. You just need to learn some of the idioms of the language. Though I typically don't really hammer people on the language during interviews anyways. I can pretty quickly get a Java dev up to speed on how to write proper Go.",

One hour commute via car five days a week with no benefits or PTO.I did that shit for 6 months while constantly applying for jobs and now I work at a proper tech org making way more money and it has completely transformed my entire life. You are infinitely more employable when you are employed. Sometimes you need to swallow your pride and take a shitty job to get your foot in the door.",

Lots of people had side gigs when they lost their jobs, some sold their homes, some moved into their folks, it wasn't easy for manyBut when I lost my job in 2018, it was tough. 1% unemployment and I couldn't find a job for 6 months. I managed to have savings, lived of credit cards, went to training (failed the exam), and by the grace of God I got a contract job that led to full-time. Also survived on ramen, WIC and unemployment.",

It's hard to say where they will be 10 years from now but I think focusing on automation in general rather than any one specific technology or tool is a pretty safe bet. Obviously you have to start with just one tool, but try to grow from there. I got started with a no name consulting company that did nothing but RPA and at the time was strictly BluePrism. Lousy pay and a ton of travel (yes, that is a bad thing), but I got a lot of very high quality experience very quickly. With 7 years experience, I'm a lead dev at an oil and gas megacorp you have heard of. So it has paid off in the long run (so far at least). Incidentally, we will be hiring a few more senior RPA developers in the near future, but obviously someone starting just now won't make the cut.",

You should use the STAR method as a framework without being too robotic of formulaic. It’s still a conversation. Also, it’s okay to shorten examples based on time; make sure to acknowledge the clock and be respectful of people’s time. For the question above you can do something like, “When I have a disagreement with someone I do [X]. I approach it this way because [X]. An example of me having a disagreement with someone is [X]. The outcome of [X] was [X] which I felt [X] way about because of [X].” Another approach maybe “I had a disagreement with [X] about [X] when working on this project. My approach to resolving it was [X] because [X]. The outcome was [X] which I felt [X] way about. I would do [X] differently in the future because of [X]” Obviously I’m being very general here. Find a format/style that fits you and your regular speaking cadence; but yes, even if brief, you should mention examples of when you came into this scenario they’re asking about. If they ask about a scenario you’ve never experienced you can say something like “I’ve actually not experienced [X] but here’s what I would do based on a similar [X] experience I had.” Show you’re flexible, adaptable and have learned from previous experiences.

So if I'm asked \"How do you handle disagreement between yourself and another senior engineer?\" I would first state that I believe I'm a smart person and I believe I work with other smart people so I like to have a thoughtful 1-on-1 conversation and find the most optimal solution. I'll then jump into a concrete example of times I have executed this in my career typically following a loose STAR format. You have to show examples of times you have lived your philosophy.

For those examples you listed like \"What do you do when you have a disagreement\" - you can absolutely start with your general approach and then back it up with a concrete example. That's actually stronger than just giving a theoretical answer because it shows you've actually dealt with these situations before.The key is reading what the interviewer really wants to know. Questions that start with \"Tell me about a time\" or \"Describe a situation\" are screaming for STAR format. But questions about your general approach or methods can be answered by explaining your process first, then illustrating it with a real example if you have one. The goal is to prove you're not just talking theory - you've actually navigated these challenges successfully. Since you're prepping so thoroughly, you might want to check out [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to practice handling these different question types and get real-time feedback on when to use STAR versus other approaches. I'm on the team that built it, and we designed it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky behavioral questions where the format isn't immediately obvious.",

Spending extra mental energy on interviews makes it more likely you do poorly at your current job. I promise if you try your best and still get pipped, the pip runway is long enough for you to prepare at that point. It’s like months of time. So for now, just try your best and document your findings.

Focus on getting really good at articulating your projects and technical decisions, and prepare solid examples that demonstrate problem-solving skills. Each grueling interview process is actually making you stronger for the next one, even when you don't get the offer. I'm on the team that built [interview AI assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate those tricky technical and behavioral questions that come up during the multiple rounds you're dealing with - it can be a game-changer for feeling more confident and prepared when you land those precious interviews.",

        "body": "I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communicationI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.As for your questions:1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. If you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. One really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. I will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. I hope that covers all of your questions! If not, feel free to ask more!",

Do you think that ceiling is common across Dynamics roles, or more specific to Business Central? I’m in a good financial position now, so I’m trying to think long-term before switching.If you were starting fresh today, which track would you recommend focusing on — CE/CRM, Business Central, or Finance & Operations? And is the uptick in demand you’re seeing more regional or global?From a career growth perspective, what kind of work do you think is needed to build a strong path in Dynamics and eventually move into leadership/architect positions? With my .NET and enterprise systems background, do you think I could make more of a lateral transition, or would I likely have to take a step down first to break into the space?Thanks again for the detailed response — this really helps me get a clearer picture of what to expect.",

I think the uptick is in the US and Europe and is more specific to BC. I haven’t heard much outside of those regions. With 5+ years of .NET experience in enterprise systems, I would think you should be able to make a lateral transition. As for career growth into an architect/leadership role, I’d say the most important thing is knowing the product well (functionally) and how it can be modified (technically) to meet the needs of the user.

In one response you admit to not knowing what job you want in the field so what does a cyber security job look like to you?General advice is go for a computer science or IT degree. Computer science is theoretical and is the foundation of how software systems are built. That knowledge helps in a lot of ways. IT is generally learning about software and how it’s used in businesses. Depending on the university you may have more or less hands on/practice. You skip computer science theory for business courses and technology courses that teach you the software/hardware that businesses need to run their operations. Cyber security is an umbrella term that addresses many areas of technology security. There’s also information security, which has a technology component but extends to more than tech. Certifications are generally vendor based and show that you understand a specific implementation of technology. They can be useful but you just have to get ones that matter to the domain you’re trying to enter. Truthfully though, cyber security is entry level for people with experience in the fields in which they attempt to secure. It’s hard for someone who hasn’t had practice in using a technology to understand some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Not saying it’s impossible, but that it’s unlikely.",

Three months of Spring Boot isn't going to cut it when you're competing against people with years of backend experience, so you need to show depth through personal projects and contributions to open source backend projects.The interview rejections are happening because you can't speak confidently about backend concepts, architecture decisions, and real-world problem-solving in that domain. You need to get comfortable discussing database design, API architecture, caching strategies, and system scalability - topics that only come from hands-on experience. Consider targeting companies that value T-shaped developers or smaller startups where you can wear multiple hats, as they're more likely to let you grow into backend work. When you do land interviews, you'll need to navigate questions about your limited backend experience tactfully while highlighting your learning ability and the projects you've built - [AI interview prep](http://interviews.chat) can help you practice articulating your transition story and handling those tricky questions about experience gaps - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people ace challenging interview scenarios like yours.",

Spend a day or two writing a simple page with header, nav, main, section and footer tags. Test it with browser dev tools and add ARIA if you want. Then mess with CSS box model and Flexbox - build a nav bar or a card, play with padding, margin, justify-content, align-items. Throw in a couple media queries to see it adapt on mobile. Finally write tiny JS scripts: practice let/const, arrow functions, map/filter and build a responsive profile card that can toggle extra info on click.Next week dive deeper in JavaScript. Drop code snippets in console to watch scope and closure - make a counter function that holds private state. Then write a basic Promise example, chain .then/.catch, and convert it to async/await with a small Fetch demo from a public API. Finish by building a mini DOM project - make a todo list or quiz app where you dynamically create elements and wire up click or input listeners.I mapped this into an 8-week plan for you if you want the full thing: https://doable.diy/plan/472xh88yv3AikgXNaFkGPr",

Some people really love it, and if you get good at it you can be competitive in the market, but know that it is tough to go back to regular development once you've made the switch into more SRE/ops type roles.So I'd suggest you make sure it is something you are really interested in. Of course, since you already have a background in react, you may have an easier time switching back than I am having making that pivot. But I have read that this is a hard switch for others as well even if they did it prior.Platform/ops work is a lot of being on call and putting out urgent fires. And day-to-day, it's a lot of YAML and not a lot of true code work, and its definitely not as creatively fulfilling as regular development. Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform. You may just be working on tooling and framework stuff that isn't a stressful, but anytime you work on a horizontal as opposed to a vertical, you are liable to be pulled into issues in parts of the system you don't know about and expected to help troubleshoot them during high pressure situations. Some people do love it though and you may be one of those people. edit: TLDR take whichever one offers you the most money, but be aware you may be taking a hit to your WLB for this type of tole.",

(These tools just choke the moment they face a bigger or more complex codebase)If you aren't learning, you can start looking for jobs, but you should definitely try and extract as much practical experience from your work and knowledge from your peers as you can before doing so, considering your experience is at zero.

Alternatively, you could joke a bit about how wild west the place was, and you're hoping for more structure at any place you're interviewing at, but you have to sell it in a way that doesn't make you look unsure.
