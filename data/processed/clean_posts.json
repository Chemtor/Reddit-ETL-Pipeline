Without understanding the business case you're just building something that most likely will be over-engineered and not useful.\"* ***\"Why do I need to care about what the business case is?\"***The conversation went on for 15 more minutes but the theme didn't change. For the millionth time, I stumbled upon the usual cdc + spark + kafka bullshit stack built without any rhyme nor reason, and nobody knows or even dared to ask how the data will be used and what is the business case.And then when you ask *\"ok but what's the business case\",* you ALWAYS get the most boilerplate Skyrim-NPC answer like: \"reporting and analytics\".Now tell me Johnny, does a business that moves slower than my grandma climbs the stairs need real-time reporting? Are they going to make real-time, sub-minute decision with all this CDC updates that you're spending so much money to extract? No? Then why the fuck did you set up a system that requires 5 engineers, 2 project managers and an exorcist to manage?I'm so fucking sick of this idea that data engineering only consists of Scooby Doo-ing together a bunch of expensive tech and call it a day.

I keep running into the same pain: just a pile of big text files. Files and object storage look simple, but in practice they slow me down. One task turns into many blobs across different places – messy. No clear schema. Even with databases, small join changes break things. The orchestrator can’t “see” the data, so batching is poor, retries are clumsy, and my GPUs sit idle.My friend helped me rethink the whole setup. What finally worked was treating everything as tables with transactions – one namespace, clear schema for samples, runs, evals, and lineage. I snapshot first, then measure, so numbers don’t drift. Queues are data-aware: group by token length or expected latency, retry per row. After this, fewer mystery bugs, better GPU use, cleaner comparisons.He wrote his view here: [https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra](https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra)Does anyone here run AI workloads on transactional, table-first storage instead of files? What stack do you use, and what went wrong or right?",

        "content": "Hi everyone, during my internship in a health institute, my main task was to clean up and document medical databases so they could later be used for clinical studies (using DBT and related tools).The problem was that the databases I worked with were really messy, they came directly from hospital software systems. There was basically no documentation at all, and the schema was a mess, moreover, the database was huge, thousands of fields and hundred of tables. Here are some examples of bad design: * No foreign keys defined between tables that clearly had relationships.* Some tables had a column that just stored the *name* of another table to indicate a link (instead of a proper relation).* Other tables existed in total isolation, but were obviously meant to be connected.To deal with it, I literally had to spend my weeks opening each table, looking at the data, and trying to guess its purpose, then writing comments and documentation as I went along.So my questions are:* Is this kind of challenge (analyzing and documenting undocumented databases) something you often encounter in data engineering / data science work?* If you’ve faced this situation before, how did you approach it? Did you have strategies or tools that made the process more efficient than just manual exploration?",

        "content": "I’ve been following (and using) the Apache Iceberg ecosystem for a while now. Early on, I had the same mindset most teams do: files + a simple SQL engine + a cron is plenty. If you’re under \\~100 GB, have one writer, a few readers, and clear ownership, keep it simple and ship.But the thing that was important was ofcourse “scale.” and the metadata. Well i took a good look at a couple of blogs to come to a conclusion for this one and also there came a need of it.So iceberg treats metadata as the system of record. Once you see that, a bunch of features stop feeling advanced and just a reminder most of the points here are for when you will scale.* Well one thing it has is Pruning without reading data, column stats (min/max/null counts) per file let engines skip almost everything before touching storage.* bad load? this was one i came across.. you’re just moving a metadata pointer to a clean snapshot.* Concurrent safety on object stores wtih optimistic transactions against the metadata, so it’s all-or-nothing, even with multiple writers.* Well nonetheless a lot of other big names do this but just putting it here schema/partition evolution tracked by stable IDs, so renames/reorders don’t break history.So if you arae a startup be simple but be prepared and it's okay to start boring. But the moment you feel pain schema churn, slower queries, more writers, hand-rolled cleanups Iceberg’s metadata intelligence starts paying for itself.If you’re curious about how the layers fit together (snapshots, manifests, stats, etc.), I wrote up a deeper breakdown in the blog above Don’t invent distributed systems problems you don’t have but don’t ignore the metadata advantages that are already there when you do.",

Finally the curated tables are exposed to Analysts via Synapse.Though I understand the working in individual tools, not sure how exactly work with all together, for example: When to create pipelines, when to create multiple notebooks, how does the requirement come, how many delta tables need to be created as per the requirement, how do I attach delta tables to synapse, what kind of activities to perform in dev/testing/prod stages.Thank you in advance.",

But the first 3 months is way busier than I thought, I need to fit in quickly as there are so many jobs left from the last DE, and as the only DE in the team, I need to provide data internally and externally with a wide range of tools: legacy VBA code, SPSS script, code written in Jupyter notebook, Python script scheduled to run by scheduler and Dagster. And for sure, lots of SQL queries. And in the near future, we are going to retire some of the flat files and migrate them to our data warehouse, and we are aiming to improve our current ML model as well. I really enjoy what I'm doing, and have no complaints about the work environment. But I am wondering if I stay here for too long, do I even have the courage to pursue other postions in a more challenging Tech company? Do they even care about what I did at my current job? If you were me, will you aim for jobs with better pay and just settle in the same environment and see if I can get a promotion or find a better role internally?\\--------------------Edit--------------------I dm the comments asking about the Bootcamp, I will not post it here as it is not my intention. In such tough job market, everyone needs to work harder to get a job, not sure if a bootcamp can land you a job.",

        "content": "I work in a shop where we used to build data warehouses with Informatica PowerCenter. We moved to a cloud stack years back and implemented these complex transformations into Scala in Databricks although we have been doing more and more Pyspark. Over time, we've had issues deploying new gold-tier models in our medallion architecture. Whenever there are highly complex transformations, it takes us a lot longer to develop and deploy. Data quality is lower. Even with lineage graphs, we cannot answer quickly and well for complex derivations if someone asks how we came up with a value in a field. Nothing we do on our new stack compared to the speed and quality when we used to have a good GUI-based ETL tool. Basically myself and 1 other team member could build data warehouses quickly and after moving to the cloud, we have tons of engineers and it takes longer with worse results.What we are considering now is to continue using Databricks for ingest and maybe bronze/silver layers and when building gold layer models with complex transformations, we use a GUI and cloud-based ETL/ELT solution. We want something like the old PowerCenter. Matillion was mentioned. Also, Informatica has a cloud solution.Any advice? What is the best GUI-based tool for ETL/ELT with the most advanced transformations available like what PowerCenter used to have with expression tranformations, aggregations, filtering, complex functions, etc.We don't care about interfaces because data will already be in the data lake. The focus is specifically on very complex transformations and complex business rules and building gold models from silver data.",

        "content": "I am a junior data engineer with a little over a year worth of experience. My role started off as a support data engineer but in the past few months, my manager has been giving the support team more development tasks since we all wanted to grow our technical skills. I have also been assigned some development tasks in the past few months, mostly fixing a bug or adding validation frameworks in different parts of a production job. Before I was the one asking for more challenging tasks and wanted to work on development tasks but now that I have been given the work, I feel like I have only disappointed my manager. In the past few months, I feel like pretty much every PR I merged ended up having some issue that either broke the job or didn’t capture the full intention of the assigned task. At first, I thought I should be testing better. Our testing environments are currently so rough to deal with that just setting them up to test a small piece of code can take a full day of work. Anyway, I did all that but even then I feel like I keep missing some random edge case or something that I failed to consider which ends up leading to a failure downstream. And I just constantly feel so dumb in front of my manager. He ends up having to invest so much time in fixing things I break and he doesn’t even berate me for it but I just feel so bad. I know people say that if your manager reviewed your code then its their responsibility too, but I feel like I should have tested more and that I should be more holistic in my considerations. I just feel so self-conscious and low on confidence. The annoying thing is that the recent validation thing I worked on, we introduced it to other teams too since it would affect their day-to-day tasks but turns out, my current validation framework technically works but it will also result in some false positives that I now need to work on. But other teams know that I am the one who set this up and that I failed to consider something so anytime, these false positives show up (until I fix it), it will be because of me. I just find it so embarrassing and I know it will happen again because no matter how much I test my code, there is always something that I will miss. It almost makes me want to never PR into production and just never write development code, keep doing my support work even though I find that tedious and boring but at least its relatively low stakes…I am just not feeling very good and doesn’t help that I feel like I am the only one making these kind of mistakes in my team and being a burden on my manager, and ultimately creating more work for him with my mistakes…Like I think even the new person on the team isn’t making as many mistakes as I am..",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all! I work on Daft full-time, and since we just shipped a big feature, I wanted to share what’s new. Daft’s been mentioned here a couple of times, so AMA too.Daft is an open-source Rust-based data engine for multimodal data (docs, images, video, audio) and running models on them. We built it because getting data into GPUs efficiently at scale is painful, especially when working with data sitting in object stores, and usually requires custom I/O + preprocessing setups.So what’s new? Two big things. **1. A new distributed engine for running models at scale**We’ve been using Ray for distributed data processing but consistently hit scalability issues. So we switched from using Ray Tasks for data processing operators to running one Daft engine instance per node, then scheduling work across these Daft engine instances. Fun fact: we named our single-node engine “Swordfish” and our distributed runner “Flotilla” (i.e. a school of swordfish).We now also use [morsel-driven parallelism](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) and dynamic batch sizing to deal with varying data sizes and skew.And we have smarter shuffles using either the Ray Object Store or our new Flight Shuffle (Arrow Flight RPC + NVMe spill + direct node-to-node transfer). **2. Benchmarks for AI workloads**We just designed and ran some swanky new AI benchmarks. Data engine companies love to bicker about TPC-DI, TPC-DS, TPC-H performance. That’s great, who doesn’t love a throwdown between Databricks and Snowflake.So we’re throwing a new benchmark into the mix for audio transcription, document embedding, image classification, and video object detection. More details linked at the bottom of this post, but tldr Daft is 2-7x faster than Ray Data and 4-18x faster than Spark on AI workloads.https://preview.redd.it/ohjpa08jyitf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5109e9cb6a8e9ca435b7ec77f522b1830b4d9a72All source code is public.

Category - you can check out the data engineering category here: [https://hire.watch/?categories=Data+Engineering](https://hire.watch/?categories=Data+Engineering)5.

Also, did you run into trade-offs, like memory usage versus insert speed, or transaction management versus parallelism?I’m hoping to gather real-world insights that go beyond theory and show what truly scales in production PostgreSQL environments.",

Also, genAI be used for data cleaning (like address parsing) or would it be too risky for production?What would you recommend?",

There are areas or industries that are difficult to surface to consumers or businesses because they're complicated. The subjects themselves and/or the underlying subject information. Science, finance, etc. There's lots of areas. AI is expected to help breakdown those barriers to increase the consumption of complicated subject matters. Guess what's required to enable this? ...data. Not just any data, good data. High integrity data, ultra high integrity data. The higher, the more valuable. Garbage data isn't going to work anymore, in any industry, as the years roll on.This isn't just true for those complicated areas, all industries will need better data. Anyone who wants to be a player in the future is going to have to upgrade and/or completely re-write their existing systems since the vast majority of data systems today produce garbage data. Partly due to businesses in-adequality budgeting for it. There is a good portion of companies that will have to completely restart their data operations, relegating their current data useless and/or obsolete. Operational, transactional, analytical, etc. This is just to get high integrity data. To implement data into products needing application/operational data feeds where AI is also expected to expand? Is an additional area. Data engineering isn't going anywhere.",

Always getting great advice here, so here comes one more question from me.I’m building a system in which I use dlt to ingest data from various sources (that are either RMDBS, API or file-based) to Microsoft Azure SQL DB. Now lets say that I have this JSON response that consists of pleeeenty of nested data (4 or 5 levels deep of arrays). Now what dlthub does is that it automatically normalizes the data and loads the arrays into subtables. I like this very much, but now upon some reading I found out that the general advice is to stick as much as possible to the raw format of the data, so in this case loading the nested arrays in JSON format in the db, or even loading the whole response as one value to a raw table with one column.Wha do you think about that? What I’m losing by normalizing it at this step, except the fact that I have a shitton of tables and I guess it’s impossible to recreate something if I don’t like the normalize logic? Am I missing something? I’m not doing any transformations except this, mind you.Thanks!",

I know it is bare bones and not at a high level but it is on what I have learnt and picked up so far. The project link is here: [https://github.com/Griff-Kyal/Data-Engineering/tree/main/nyc-tlc-pipeline](https://github.com/Griff-Kyal/Data-Engineering/tree/main/nyc-tlc-pipeline) . I'd love to know what to learn / implement for my next project to get it at a level which would get recognised by potential employee.Also, since I don't have a qualification in the field, I have been looking into the 'Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate' course and wondered if its something I should look at doing to boost my CV/ potential hire-ability ? Thanks for taking the time and i appreciate all and any feedback",

I also discovered that you can achieve something similar for backfills using`ARRAY_AGG()` in Snowflake, though I’m not sure what potential downsides there might be.Does anyone have a code example or a preferred approach for this kind of scenario?Thanks in advance :red_heart:",

        "content": "Hi everyone,My company is looking into using Snowflake as our main data warehouse, and I'm trying to accurately forecast our potential storage costs.Here's our situation: we'll be collecting sensor data every five minutes from over 5000 pieces of equipment through their web APIs. My proposed plan is to first pull that data, use a library like pandas to do some initial cleaning and organization, and then convert it into compressed Parquet files. We'd then place these files in a staging area and most likely our cloud blob storage but we're flexible and could use Snowflake's internal stage as well.My specific question is about what happens to the data size when we copy it from those Parquet files into the actual Snowflake tables. I assume that when Snowflake loads the data, it's stored according to its data type (varchar, number, etc.) and then Snowflake applies its own compression.So, would the final size of the data in the Snowflake table end up being more, less, or about the same as the size of the original Parquet file? Let’s say, if I start with a 1 GB Parquet file, will the data consume more or less than 1 GB of storage inside Snowflake tables?I'm really just looking for a sanity check to see if my understanding of this entire process is on the right track.Thanks!",

And fortunately, we have access to a wide range of technology. Mainly what would hold us back is our own limited vision and time. So, I think we need to find and follow a playbook for what kind of architecture to learn about and go build, and I’m looking for suggestions on what that might be. TIA!",

This will happen *once at most for any record*.I understand SCD Type 3 is used for such cases.Something like the following:|value|prev\\_value||:-|:-||A|null|Then, after updating the record:|value|prev\\_value||:-|:-||B|A|But I'm thinking of an alternative which more explicitly captures the binary (initial vs final) state of the record: something like value and orig\\_value. Set value = orig\\_value, unless business updates the record. Something like:|value|orig\\_value||:-|:-||A|A|Then, after updating the record:|value|orig\\_value||:-|:-||B|A|Is there any reason NOT to do it this way? Business will make the updates to records by editing an upstream table via a file upload. I feel that this approach would simplify the SQL logic; a simple coalesce would do the job. Plus having only one column change as opposed to multiple feels cleaner, and the column names can communicate the intent of these fields better.",

        "content": "I'd like to share a project I've been working on called **Flint**:Flint transforms data engineering by shifting from custom code to declarative configuration for complete ETL pipeline workflows. The framework handles all execution details while you focus on what your data should do, not how to implement it. This configuration-driven approach standardizes pipeline patterns across teams, reduces complexity for ETL jobs, improves maintainability, and makes data workflows accessible to users with limited programming experience.The processing engine is abstracted away through configuration, making it easy to switch engines or run the same pipeline in different environments. The current version supports Apache Spark, with Polars support in development.It is not intended to replace all pipeline programming work but rather make straightforward ETL tasks easier so engineers can focus on more interesting and complex problems.See an example configuration at the bottom of the post. Check out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)## Why I Built ItTraditional ETL development has several pain points:- Engineers spend too much time writing boilerplate code for basic ETL tasks, taking away time from more interesting problems- Pipeline logic is buried in code, inaccessible to non-developers- Inconsistent patterns across teams and projects- Difficult to maintain as requirements change## Key Features- **Pure Configuration**: Define sources, transformations, and destinations in JSON or YAML- **Multi-Engine Support**: Run the same pipeline on Pandas, Polars, or other engines- **100% Test Coverage**: Both unit and e2e tests at 100%- **Well-Documented**: Complete class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and design principles- **Strongly Typed**: Full type safety throughout the codebase- **Comprehensive Alerts**: Email, webhooks, files based on configurable triggers- **Event Hooks**: Custom actions at key pipeline stages (onStart, onSuccess, etc.)## Looking for Contributors!The foundation is solid - 100% test coverage, strong typing, and comprehensive documentation - but I'm looking for contributors to help take this to the next level. Whether you want to add new engines, add tracing and metrics, change CLI to use click library, extend the transformation library to Polars, I'd love your help!Check out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)```jsonc{ \"runtime\": { \"id\": \"customer-orders-pipeline\", \"description\": \"ETL pipeline for processing customer orders data\", \"enabled\": true, \"jobs\": [ { \"id\": \"silver\", \"description\": \"Combine customer and order source data into a single dataset\", \"enabled\": true, \"engine_type\": \"spark\", // Specifies the processing engine to use \"extracts\": [ { \"id\": \"extract-customers\", \"extract_type\": \"file\", // Read from file system \"data_format\": \"csv\", // CSV input format \"location\": \"examples/join_select/customers/\", // Source directory \"method\": \"batch\", // Process all files at once \"options\": { \"delimiter\": \",\", // CSV delimiter character \"header\": true, // First row contains column names \"inferSchema\": false // Use provided schema instead of inferring }, \"schema\": \"examples/join_select/customers_schema.json\" // Path to schema definition } ], \"transforms\": [ { \"id\": \"transform-join-orders\", \"upstream_id\": \"extract-customers\", // First input dataset from extract stage \"options\": {}, \"functions\": [ {\"function_type\": \"join\", \"arguments\": {\"other_upstream_id\": \"extract-orders\", \"on\": [\"customer_id\"], \"how\": \"inner\"}}, {\"function_type\": \"select\", \"arguments\": {\"columns\": [\"name\", \"email\", \"signup_date\", \"order_id\", \"order_date\", \"amount\"]}} ] } ], \"loads\": [ { \"id\": \"load-customer-orders\", \"upstream_id\": \"transform-join-orders\", // Input dataset for this load \"load_type\": \"file\", // Write to file system \"data_format\": \"csv\", // Output as CSV \"location\": \"examples/join_select/output\", // Output directory \"method\": \"batch\", // Write all data at once \"mode\": \"overwrite\", // Replace existing files if any \"options\": { \"header\": true // Include header row with column names }, \"schema_export\": \"\" // No schema export } ], \"hooks\": { \"onStart\": [], // Actions to execute before pipeline starts \"onFailure\": [], // Actions to execute if pipeline fails \"onSuccess\": [], // Actions to execute if pipeline succeeds \"onFinally\": [] // Actions to execute after pipeline completes (success or failure) } } ] }}```",

Pandas made this less than optimal to query fast and still took a fair amount of time to build the flow tree.Many months of engineering later, I released PyThermite, a fully in memory query engine that indexed pure python objects, not dataframes or arbitrary data proxies. This also means that object attribute updates will automatically update the search index, eliminating the need for multi pass data creation.https://github.com/tylerrobbins5678/PyThermitePerformance appears be be absolutely destroying pandas and even polars in query performance. 6x -70x on 10M objects objects with a 19 part query. Index / dataframe build performance is significantly slower as expected, but thats the upfront cost with constant time lookup capability.What's everyone's thoughts on this? I am in the ETL space in my career and have always leaned more into the OOP concepts which are discarded in favor of row/col data. Is this a solution thats reusable or just only for those holding onto OOP hope?",

Would I extract files from the database through custom scripts (Python, shell) which access the production database and copy data to a dedicated file system?2. Would the file system be on the same server as the database or on a separate server?3. Is it better to extract the data from a replica or would it also be acceptable to access the production database?4. How do I connect an on-premise server with cloud storage?5. How do I transfer the extracted data that is now on the file system to cloud storage? Again custom scripts?6. What about tools like Fivetran and Airbyte?",

        "author": "ShipPuzzleheaded2022",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I currently work full time as an operational analyst in the energy industry. This is my first job out of college, and I make around mid 79K(base). I’m also in grad school for Data Science and AI, and my classes are in person. My job isn’t very technical right now. It’s more operational and repetitive, and my manager doesn’t really let me get involved in data or reporting work. My long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role.I recently got an offer from another company in a different industry. The pay is in the low 80s and the role is hybrid with about two to three days in the office. It’s a bit more technical than what I do now since it focuses on Power BI and reporting, but it’s still not super advanced or coding heavy. The new job offers more PTO and I’d have more autonomy to build models and learn skills on my own. The only catch is that raises aren’t guaranteed or significant.Here’s my situation. My current company is fully in person but it’s less than 10 miles from home and school. The new job is 30 to 40 miles each way, so the commute would be a lot longer even though it’s hybrid. At the beginning of next year, I’ll be eligible to apply for internal transfers into more data driven departments. However, I’m not sure how guaranteed that process really is since this is my first job in the industry. If I do move into a different role internally, the pay becomes much more competitive, but again it’s not something I can fully rely on. I’m also due for a raise of around 4 percent, a bonus, and about 3K in tuition reimbursement that I’d lose if I left now.Financially, the new offer doesn’t change much. Maybe a few hundred more a month after taxes, but it offers hybrid flexibility, slightly more technical work, and a bit more freedom.Would you stay until the beginning of next year to collect the raise and bonus and then try to move internally into a more data focused role? Or would you take the hybrid offer in a new domain for the Power BI experience and flexibility, even though the commute is longer and the pay difference is small?TL;DR: First job out of college making mid 70K offered a low 80s hybrid role that’s a little more technical (Power BI and reporting) but in a new industry with longer commute and no guaranteed raises. Current job is closer to home and school, and I’ll get a raise, bonus, and tuition reimbursement if I stay until the beginning of next year plus a chance to transfer internally, though I’m not sure how guaranteed that is. If I move internally, the pay would be much more competitive, but it’s still a risk. Long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role. Not sure if I should stay or take the new role.",

The existing container is stopped and a new container is started from the pulled image. It’s fairly simple and works as intended. But, I foresee an issue in the future. For now, I’m the only developer so I time the deployments for when there are no jobs running on Dagster. But when the number of jobs and developers increase I don’t think that will be possible.

Keep working on the dimensional modelling side of DE, since there is a new project involved in business department. So basically will be working mostly on business understanding & data transformation hence the dimensional model2. Move to the DE in IT department & will mostly work with more upstream layer (think bronze layer) & ETL pipelines moving data from different sourcesI'm currently more inclined towards choice 1, but what do you guys think about the future prospects?Thanks in advance",

        "content": "Background:I’ve been working as a Data Engineer for about 3.5 years, mainly on data migrations and warehouse engineering for analytics.Even though I’m still technically a junior, for the last couple of years I’ve worked on fairly big projects with a lot of responsibility, often figuring things out on my own and delivering without much help.I’m on £40k and recently started doing a degree alongside work. I’m in a decent position to move up.The company is big but my team is small (1 manager, 1 senior, 2 juniors). It’s generally a good place to work, though promotions and recognition are quite slow — most people move internally to progress. As the other junior and senior are on a single project, I'm doing all others currently.I normally get bored after about a year in a job, but I’ve been here for 2 years and still enjoy most of the work despite a few frustrations.Current situation:My girlfriend lives in Germany (we’ve been together for 4 years), and I want to move there. My current job doesn’t allow working abroad, so I’ll need to find something a way to make it happen. I do fortunately have EU citizenshipI’ve had a few opportunites in Germany. Some looked promising but didn’t work out (e.g. they needed someone to start immediately, or misrepresented parts of the process). Overall, though, I seem to get decent interest.Main issue:A lot of roles in Germany require a degree (I’m working on one but don’t have it yet).Many jobs also want fluent German. Mine is still pretty basic, but I’m learning.I'm considering:EU contracting - I like the idea of doing different projects every 6–12 months while living in Germany. I haven’t looked properly into the legal/tax side yet, but it sounds like it could fit well.Building a product/startup- I’ve built a very basic MVP that provides analytics (including some predictive analysis) for small–mid sized e-commerce companies. It’s early, but I think it could be developed into more of a template/solution to offer as a service potentially.Career progression - I don’t want to stay as a junior any longer and its so low priority for the company currently. I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my side I’m juggling a lot right now: work, uni, the product idea, and the thought of switching to contracting and moving abroad. I want to move things forward without getting stuck in the same place for too long or burning out trying to do everything at once.Any advice on * Moving to Germany as a data professional without fluent German* Whether EU contracting is a good stepping stone or just a distraction right now* If it’s smarter to build the product before or after relocating* General advice on avoiding career stagnation while juggling multiple prioritiesTL;DR:3.5 yrs as a Data Engineer, junior title, £40k, started a degree. Want to move to Germany (girlfriend), progress career, maybe try contracting or build a startup/product. Feels like a lot to juggle and I don’t want to get stuck. Looking for advice from people who’ve been through similar moves or decisions.",

There are separate tools for each part of the data engineering process, which seems unnecessarily complicated and not ideal for small teams.Would anyone benefit from a simple tool that handles raw extracts, allows transformations in SQL, and lets you add data tests at any step in the process—all with a workflow engine that manages the flow end to end?I spent the last few years building a tool that does exactly this. It's not perfect, but the main purpose is to help small data teams get started quickly by automating repetitive pieces of the data pipeline process, so they can focus on complex data integration work that needs more attention.I'm thinking about open sourcing it. Since data engineers really like to tinker, I figure the ability to modify any generated SQL at each step would be important. The tool is currently opinionated about using best practices for loading data (always use a work table in Redshift/Snowflake, BCP for SQL Server, defaulting to audit columns for every load, etc.).Would this be useful to anyone else?",

Operating systems, protocols, programming languages, databases—much of it originated or matured during that era.What's crazy is that these developers had limited computing power, no Stack Overflow, no VSCode, no GitHub Copilot... and yet, they built Unix, TCP/IP, C, early Linux, compilers, text editors, early web browsers, and more. Even now, we study their work to understand how things actually function under the hood.So my questions are:What did they actually learn back then that made them capable of such deep work?Was it just \"computer science basics\" or something more?Did having fewer abstractions make them better engineers because they had to understand everything from the metal up?Is today's developer culture too reliant on tools and frameworks, while they built things from scratch?I'm genuinely curious—did the limitations of the time force them to think differently, or are we missing something in how we approach learning today?Would love to hear from people who were around back then or who study that era. What was the mindset like? How did you learn OS design, networking, or programming when the internet wasn’t full of tutorials?Let’s talk about it.",

        "content": "I only lurk on Reddit, but I have to ask. Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C and low level programming? For reference, I am in college getting a degree in IT. My degree is generally more networking, infrastructure, and cybersecurity than computer science. The only computer science classes I have to take have been in python, a web development class, and an Intro to Computer Systems class in C. I did well in web development, and I absolutely LOVED the classes in python. C has been a different animal. I had to work SO hard to barely pass Intro to Computer Systems. The content was kind of interesting, but it was a ton of work. I made it though. I decided that low level just wasn't for me and moved on. Last year, I got to take a Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation class. It was all in C, but we didn't do any actual development in C. We only reverse engineered C code, then wrote exploits in assembly or hex. I loved this class as well. It was super hard, but I really enjoyed learning about how the exploits worked. The class was geared towards security researchers, which is not what I want to do, but I still loved it. My university's computer science program recently started an Operating Systems Development class, based on MIT's xv6 operating system (RISC-V). I decided to give low level development (specifically C) a second chance, but it has not been going well. The content is interesting, but I genuinely feel too stupid to learn it. The lectures feel impossible to follow, and the labs generally take me about twice as long to complete as other students. I mostly decided to take this class to learn more about a topic I probably wouldn't learn on my own, and I don't need this class to graduate. Regardless, I don't want to drop the class. I feel like I \"can\" do it, but its been so hard. It's kinda making me think that I might just not be smart enough to do low level programming, and that I should stick to the higher level stuff where I do better. Is it possible to not be smart enough? Or am I just making a big deal out of a skill issue? I enjoy learning about the content, but it takes me so long to get the labs done. Even after I complete them, I usually don't fully understand why my bug fixes work. I try to research them, but get lost in the sauce a little bit.",

But learning to *read* code well is just as important as writing it. I have a few actionable tips to get started with reading code* Make a mental map of the functions: * When your going through the code always try a high level outline of the file and then build on that towards. Like for example, start at the top of the file and go through the functions clicking on them to go towards the source code* Run the code through a debugger : * One of the underrated ways to understand a codebase is to run the code that you are reading through a debugger. Attach a breakpoint and the simulate running the code, you will understand the flow of the code extremely well.* Start from the test cases: * If the project has test cases, that’s your entry point. Run them and *watch what happens*. * What objects are being created? * Which functions are called first? * What files are imported?Learning to read code well takes time. You won’t understand everything the first time and that’s okay. But if you repeat this process across 3/4 small projects, your brain starts to see code structure naturally.",

I then set the background colour manually and then add top, bottom, left and right borders one by one manually.

(Apart from that, I don't understand how people manage to find so much time for it alongside family, friends, household chores, sports, and possibly other hobbies.)How is it for you? Do you finish work at the end of the day, or do you sit down and do something else?",

A few small adjustments have made a big difference for me: raising my monitor so I’m not looking down all the time, keeping my chair at the right height so my elbows are at 90 degrees, taking short stretch breaks every hour, and drinking more water so I actually stand up more often.On the gear side, switching to a split keyboard (I’m using the NocFree Lite) helped me keep my shoulders relaxed instead of hunched in, and a vertical mouse (Logitech) took some pressure off my wrist. I also started paying more attention to posture, feet flat on the floor, back supported, and trying not to crane my neck forward.I’m curious what’s worked for other people here. Do you have a specific routine, piece of gear, or desk setup hack that’s saved you from neck or wrist pain? Would love to collect some practical ideas from folks who code every day.",

The source code of my project2. Create their own API key 3.

What will be more beneficial here? Is it moving forward with CS50 or TOP or starting the C++ book as originally intended?I've always seen this idea reiterated quite often that choosing a programming language for a novice is not as important as it is to choose a good course that teaches the fundamentals of programming. But then you would eventually loose your time re-learning your target language. So I'm a bit confused and wanted to hear the opinions of intermediate and experienced programmers on this particular statement.Do you agree with this mentality of learning the fundamentals without being hyper-fixated about the language or do you think that learning your target language is more important from the get-go?Thanks in advance <3",

Honestly, I’m facing this right now. I have eight months of professional experience, but my GitHub and LinkedIn are practically empty. I don’t have any project I can say, “I built this using X technology,” with a README that thoroughly explains the development, system design, and API design.Currently, I’m unemployed and want to take on this new challenge in my career. The first question that comes to mind is: **what should I develop?** I’m thinking of starting with a simple project, like a CRUD, and then adding features like table relationships, authentication and authorization, caching, etc. On the other hand, I’m wondering if it would be better to split each topic into separate solutions:* **Project 1:** CRUD and relationships* **Project 2:** Authentication and authorization* **Project 3:** Combine everything + front-endI admit I’m not very creative yet and don’t have many ideas for solving real problems, but I’ve considered the following projects:1. **To-do List** – simple, easy, and generic, but many people already do this, which could be a downside.2. **Address API** – CRUD for addresses, integrating an external API for automatic address completion. But I wonder if it makes sense to use an API just to fill in addresses.3. **Identity API** – authentication and authorization system, including forms and two types of auth: JWT and OAuth, with email verification.At the moment, I’m focusing mainly on two projects: authentication and CRUD. I plan to build a full portfolio later, once I learn Angular and can integrate back-end and front-end.**Bonus question:** From what I wrote above, my insecurity probably shows, but is it worth creating creative projects for a junior developer position, or do companies mostly just want to see that you can use the technologies and figure things out?",

I've researched as best I can, eaten up tutorials and free resources and even yr vids. I practice in vs code and use github for projects and spare codes. But I feel overwhelmed and a little lost.Im trying not to make it abou5 getting a job ( career change, currently unemployed and desperate) But it's difficult due to how inter3sted i am.Ill get these days that I hyperfocus and jsut go down the rabbit hole and what I end up with it.... a mess tbh.My question is - do any long term programmers/endgineers/web devs have legit, concrete advice that worked for them when learning?I don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>) But I honestly feel like I need a direction.Mi first goal is to build a personal website as a holding place for my tentative projects, amateur blog of my learning process and what has helped me, and maybe a few scattered real like things in there too. I also plan to add in a section for gaming suggestions such as custom content, add-ons, guides etcAs well as a resources of various thingsIt's all a long term goal. Im attempting to learn basic vanilla html,css, and javascript first before delving deep into any frameworks I like to have a basic understanding of beat practices and why's first. But again... ADHD messing with my brain. Overwhelmed. Jittery. Want to do ALL THE THINGS AT ONCE.So... does anyone have ANG suggestion of how to begin this hefty project and maybe break it down into easily digestible pieces???Id so appreciate it you have NO idea.EDIT - UPDATE:: Thank you everyone so much for the honesty and helpful advice. It feels great to have people with far far more experience reach out and give tips. I seriously appreciate it. Especially considering when I made this post, I did it during an adhd spiral. I get far too honest and far too chatty without even considering the ramifications later. So I very much appreciate everyone's reply. I will be taking notes and keeping them all in mind! It definitely helps me put things into perspective and helps me figure out how and where to start with my own projects.",

My goal is to be job ready by the first quarter of 2026.​My background:- ​I have some foundational knowledge in Java/Spring Boot/MySql from online courses to build simple REST API.- ​I also know a bit of Python (bootcamp).​​Some questions I have:​1) With my Java/Spring Boot/MySql knowledge, what else should I learn to target backend roles? Is it more valuable for a junior to have full-stack skills and I should pick up a frontend framework like React?​2) Beyond programming languages, what are the absolute must have for a junior developer today? I keep hearing about Git, Docker, CI/CD, and basic cloud services. How important are these for a first role?​3) What kind of personal projects really stand out to hiring managers for a junior role? Is a full stack CRUD application enough, or should I aim for something more complex?​Any advice or personal experience you can share would be incredibly helpful. Thank you in advance!",

Was it:* Open source / cross-platform freedom?* Microsoft lock-in concerns?* Better community or tooling at the time?* Enterprise demand / job market?* Something else entirely?And for those who’ve stuck with Java since then — do you still feel it was the right call?

I have most of the skills necessary when it comes to this like 3d modeling, drawing, animation and sound. However I lack the most essential skill, coding. I use unity, which means I code in c#, and I have tried learning it so many times but every time i have tried to learn either I resort to chatgpt or other peoples code or i just give up. I feel terrible using chatgpt because its just not good, it ruins a game because it was made by a clanker ai robot instead of a real human being and I don't want to be like that, but every time I have ever tried to make a game or learn how to code I have given up. The furthest I have learnt in c# right now is variables, logic gates, events and basic 2d movement along with rigidbody 2d movement but nothing else, and I just want to give up all the time and have been giving up then trying again then giving up over and over and over for the past like 4 years and idk what to do at this point. So if anybody has a solution please pretty please with a cherry on top tell me. Youtube videos never worked for me, i tried learning with chatgpt, that didn't work either, i have talked to other people who know how to code and that didnt work, just about nothing works for me. I even wrote notes on c# in my book and thats how I know about variables, logic gates, events etc but theres honestly so much crap in coding i just get lost :(",

The if statement is checking if `write - read` is positive, which would happen if, in the diagram, write is to the right of read. Yet the comment above this `if` is the opposite. 2) The last line doesn't make sense when walking through an example. Let's say the buffer is of size 8, with the write pointer at 2 and the read pointer at 5, so it looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/C3Q6hHIthis would mean write - read is -3, so that if statement would be false. The function would then return `size - write + read` which would be `8 - 2 + 5` ==> `11`. This does *not* seem right. The length of the data of a buffer of size 8 can't be 11.Am I just totally misunderstanding something here??",

        "content": "Friends, since I started programming, I’ve enjoyed frontend the most. The reason is simple: I can see the work I do immediately. Whether it’s on the web, desktop, or another platform, I genuinely enjoy seeing something appear on the screen. Backend, on the other hand, has always felt a bit boring to me; I write code, but I don’t see the result right away, the process feels tedious, and I lose motivation.Just doing frontend alone doesn’t feel fun enough. If nothing happens when I click a button, I can’t enjoy it and my motivation drops. Unless there’s some action involved a working system, data, and interaction frontend by itself isn’t enough for me.I’m now in my last year of high school, and I don’t know what to do for my career. I have a few project ideas in mind, but they’re either too big or don’t seem feasible. My backend knowledge isn’t sufficient either. That’s why sometimes I think about getting help from AI, but I also feel afraid. If I rely too much on AI, I won’t learn on my own, I won’t be able to fix errors, and I won’t be able to build a solid code structure.In short, I love frontend, but it’s not enough on its own. The projects I want to build are big and complex, so I need backend knowledge but attempting big projects without learning it is hard. Amid this uncertainty, I don’t know how to move forward.Also, I struggle when preparing projects; I can’t plan questions like “where should I start?” very well.",

Programming feels so foreign it feels diff than with math where there are formulas and if you follow the method you’ll get the answer. I feel like i just get confused how you have to be so precise abt writing the code a certain way to get a desired output but even so there are still different ways to write it. Also, the fact that there are just so many aspects like functions, classes, references, pointers and trying to understand it is hard let alone writing the code from scratch. Looking at example code and figuring out the output is hard already, i find it even harder to write from scratch it feels so tedious and then im struggling to remember what these other things mean. Also, my class expects some type of prior knowledge but i’ve finally understood functions and we’re moving onto pointers, references, and classes so fast. Is there a better way to look at this, we’re moving so fast and I’m worried I’ll fall behind. I’m sorry this is so long any tips would be appreciated.",

I instantly loved it , it felt meaningful, impactful, and technically interesting. So I jumped in, did a good bit of research, and started thinking about how I could make it my own.At first, my plan was to:* Build a basic sign language recognition system using a webcam, Python, and OpenCV.* Expand the word library beyond the typical 10-20 signs.* Focus specifically on Irish Sign Language (ISL) to localize it more.But as I kept researching, I realized I might’ve been on the wrong side of the internet early on, because it turns out that projects like this have already been done a *lot*. My additions (more words, ISL focus) don’t really feel like enough to count as a real advancement or innovation, especially for a final year project.I then thought: what if I added a region detection feature? Something that could detect which sign language dialect is being used (e.g., ASL vs BSL vs ISL). But again, the more I dig, the more I see that similar ideas have been explored — and I'm starting to feel like I’m just re-inventing existing wheels without offering anything new.To be honest, I’m really stuck now, I’ve backed myself into a project that’s been done too many times already, and I’m not sure how to meaningfully innovate it.I would love some advice on this, what more can i add, and should i just give up. If you guys have any other ideas i could do instead, that would be amazing.Thank you",

I've gotten a bit too used to asking AI for helping with building, coding, debugging, or problem-solving, and I do miss the deeper learning feeling.I'd love to hear from you all - how did you manage to break out of that habit or if you had been in my situation, how did you find a way to use AI more wisely while learning stuff?

After a few days, I realized it would be impossible without at least some basic coding knowledge (I hate not understanding what I’m doing). That’s when, thanks to a YouTube video, I first discovered FreeCodeCamp and then TOP. Right now, I’ve completed the first two projects and I’m about to dive into the basics of JavaScript—and I’m proud of that, especially considering I’m a cook by trade and had never been interested in this stuff before.At first, there’s a LOT of reading, but trust me, it’s essential. As they say themselves, every new concept is introduced at the right moment in the learning process (at least in the Foundations), so there’s no need to fall down rabbit holes trying to understand things you don’t need at that exact moment. Be consistent with your learning (at least 1 hour a day) to build a nice progression curve, and don’t skip any lesson!Here’s a tip about Flexbox and CSS in general, which can be confusing at first: don’t hesitate to look for other resources (videos or blogs) to understand a concept that didn’t click right away.Do your exercises carefully and only check the solution as a last resort—it’s better to struggle for a few days and then get that dopamine hit when you finally solve it.Spam these two tricks like they’re infinite resources:* Add solid borders to everything in your HTML to see all the boxes and understand how they move.* Inspect your elements as many times as necessary—it helps you catch unwanted margins or see which parent element your content is nested in (perfect for solving CSS conflicts).So yeah, that’s my first experience with the world of web dev. At first, it was just something I *had* to do to build the website I wanted, but now it feels like a passion that I practice EVERY SINGLE DAY! I hope that one day I’ll be able to do this professionally and leave my job as a cook in a retirement home lol.\\*By a french guy :)",

        "author": "Ssingleaspringle",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I know that standard C types (long, unsigned long etc.) do not strictly define the size of memory allocated for a variable - the size may differ between platforms. For example x86_64 architecture on Linux uses 8 bytes for variables of type long and 32-bit ARM processors use 4 bytes for the same type (long). The solution for that problem would be to use fixed-width variable types like uint32_t. This part is quite self-explainatory: we can use fixed-width variable types for cross-platform portability.   But I don't quite understand how one should approach numeric literals in C. Let's say I assign a value like this: uint32_t x = 5; Many guides encourage and stress the use of type suffixes stating that I should write uint32_t x = 5LU to ensure the correct type of the assigned literal. LU stands for unsigned long. The part with unsigned kinda makes sense, but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place. A well-known case where this may cause problems is when performing binary operations on values like this.printf(\"%zu, sizeof(1L));printf(\"%ld, 1L << 31);The result (the same code compiled and run on x86_64 Linux and 32-bit ARM CPU) proves that this is a real problem and the usage of suffixes is not portable across platforms at all.ARM result: 4 -2147483648Linux result: 8 2147483648So my question is: how do you guys approach this problem? I've seen alternatives like using macros UINT32_C(5); or staight up casting (uint32_t) 5; but they also seem to have their own problems. The most common style I see is using suffixes. Programming teams also seem to not care that much (I get it - it's an additional 8 characters per variable declaration :face_with_tongue:) until it becomes a problem.",

        "content": "I am learning backend by developing a simple URL shortener project. The goal of this project is to learn and try to do things in simple but better ways. I have two things in mind that I need some advice/suggestions onTech stack: Python, FastAPI, Postgres, SQLAlchemy1. How to handle click events (URL clicks used for simple analytics)?2. How to handle sequentially related operations? For example, if a User is deactivated, all the URLs of that user should be deactivatedThis is the way I started to think and improvise:As a beginner, updating the DB step by step is the usual way. The user clicks a short URL, and the click is registered in the DB (url\\_id, clicked\\_at, any other metadata), and then the redirection happens. Now this is a typical setup, but this may work for a few users. When I think of thousands or even millions of users, this won’t work. Yes, I can think of scaling the infrastructure, but DB operations are costly, and I need to only think about the important DB updates. When I was reading about this, I came across the concept of eventual consistency. I wanted to know how these things can be done, and came across using tasks in the background. Important updates can be done in the DB, and the rest can be pushed to the task queue to perform later. This was the basic idea I thought of. (Read Celery)Now coming to 1), I have a clicks table, and I just record the clicks. Now, for a few users, direct DB insert is fine, but for many users, this will be a bottleneck. Using a task for each click is overkill. Then I thought, can I use some sort of buffer which captures clicks in bulk and then pushes a task for a bulk update? Now the question is what to use? The read should be quick, so Redis comes into the picture, but persistence is an issue. Clicks are important data, accuracy can be debated. I can use Redis persistence mechanisms to manage it, but is this the right way to do it? Redis captures the clicks metadata. I will have a periodic task to scan the Redis, if there is any data, I fetch it in chunks and bulk update the DB. This looks good, but is there a better way to do it? When I looked into this, I came across event-driven architecture and Kafka. All these things went over my head, as I am just doing a simple project in a mono repo modular way. Please suggest any other ways to achieve this in a simpler and better way.Coming to 2), I have a user table, which has the user status. When a user deactivates, all the URLs related to that user should also be deactivated. For a few users, updating user status and then updating URL status is a typical setup, but thinking on scale, this is not feasible. Suppose 1000 users deactivate at a time, each user having 100 URLs, updating all at once will take time. What I thought was to update the user status and let the frontend show it. This is the UI level update for user consistency. The URL updates can be delayed, maybe using tasks. I thought of using per-user tasks. User deactivates, user status is updated, and a deactivate task is pushed to the queue. If the queue has fewer tasks, and workers aren't busy, then every task will be quickly done. But what if the user's status changes before the task is executed? Say the user logged in and the user is active, again, I push a task to reactivate URLs. So in a very small period of time, the user status went from active to deactivated to active again. Status is unchanged, but the URL status changed twice through two tasks, which wasn’t required. These cases may be rare, but I have to consider them. So to manage this, I can have a simple table to keep track of status using versions. Start with 1, and then update when the status changes. For the URL, I just keep track of the last user status version which updated the URL status. So I have (user\\_status\\_version, last\\_user\\_status\\_version\\_url\\_update). When I push a task, I send the user version as the task version and then check if there is any URL update needed. Task just checks the task version and user version with the last update URL version to make URL status changes if needed. This works fine, but now the question is, if there are a huge number of users, can the task queue be overloaded? Then I thought of having a scheduled task which runs periodically. Here, I focus on the current state of the user status. For this, I need to maintain a table with (user\\_id, status, version, updated\\_at). All the status updates will be recorded here per user. The task will check for version differences, fetch the current user status and then make necessary changes only if required. In both methods, I have to access the DB. Is there a way to avoid this? Maybe have a buffer to store the actions for some time and then process them in bulk. Same as in 1), I thought of using Redis as an intermediate data store. A task will run periodically and check for Redis entries, if present, they will be fetched and pushed as a task to the queue to process them and update the database. Processing can be made efficient further with looping chunks or multiple tasks processing different chunks of data, etc.These are the ideas which I could think of. Are there any other ways of doing it? Feel free to suggest/advise or provide any resources. Please correct me if my thinking is wrong, I'm trying to learn as much as possible.",

It is possible to link entities via link definitions ( e.g. *hazard* **belongs to** *risk* ), so one entity is pointing to others.https://i.sstatic.net/lWWf5z9F.pngReading data via system GUI========The system itself provides 2 approaches to display data in its own GUI- writing raw SQL- providing a [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) query stringBoth approaches work for the most cases but complex queries are not possible. If the SQL query is too complex, the system won't execute it ( because of security reasons ), some SQL statements got blacklisted. Same for the Lucene query, you can only query very basic information. If you want to read complex data you have to write a custom Java plugin and query the database on your own.My current solution========There are several domains that require different domain specific queries ( e.g. Risk management, Cyper security, ... )Since I want to read complex data and visualize it in a table I thought it could be useful to separate the transformed UI data from the raw fetching data.So a very simple UI might look like this | Risks | Risks | Hazards || ----- | ----- | ----- || render some fields of Risk 1 | render other fields of Risk 1 | render Hazard 1 |As you can see one entity can be displayed differently in multiple columns. But since we only want to read it once ( to calculate a tree representing a table matrix ) I thought data sources would do the trick.A single data source describes which data to load. It is a pool of entities with their fields. There must be a leading data source and there can be a list of following data sources depending on each other.```tsdataSources: { leading: { id: \"unique-id\", // a unique ID for the data source entityTypeIds: [ \"entityType-1\", \"entityType-2\" ], // describe which types to load fieldIds: [ \"field-1\" ], // only fetch the desired custom fields }, following: [{ // ... following DS extends the leading DS ... dependsOn: { dataSourceId: \"id-of-the-related-data-source\", // point to the other data source ( e.g. leading ) relation: { // describe the link definition typeId: \"has\", // the ID of the link definition sourceIs: \"other\" // which direction to use? ( can be \"me\" or \"other\" ) } } }]}```Each data source loads entities with their fields based on its configuration. Related following data sources load entities based on the relation and the final result will be a data graph.Now this approach comes with some limitations:- You have to be sure that each field ID exists for each entity type- You have to be sure that the defined link definition matches each entity type of the related data source- leading data will be fetched from the current project only but related data will be fetched from everywhere ( no limits ) To add a filter to a data source I had a look at [MongoDB filter expressions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/eq/) and created my own simple filters, e.g.```ts// Comparison operators ( equals ){ \"$eq\": [\"fieldId\", \"value\"]}// Logical operators ( and | not | or ){ \"$and\": [] // Expecting other filters, e.g. comparison operators}```When it comes to very complex filtering, e.g.> Pick risk if linked to any hazard and at least one hazard is of category biological the only way I solved it was to hardcode some filter steps in the backend code and define them inside an action```ts// Filter action { name: \"my filter action\", // the name of the backend method param1: ..., param2: ..., ...}```With all the information the backend is able to process data source by data source ( \"column wise\" ) but my approach not ideal. Traversing 3000 risks with a generic SQL query ( by transforming the basic filters ) and applying filter methods on them is very slow. The external system is slow itself so rendering a table with ~30 columns and maybe 50 rows can take up to 1 minute ( depends on domain complexity ). ~5 seconds is considered \"fast\".I'm looking for a very generic data structure to describe exactly what I want in one run ( if possible )> Lessons learned: I think it's to slow to process data source by data source ( column wise ) because the UI has to wait everything to be fetched. It might be better to create a structure that resolves a whole \"UI\" row ( all data sources together ) because the backend could stream row by row so the client could start rendering some results earlier.So I'm thinking about overhauling the whole application in terms of flexibility and performance.\"improve existing structure\" idea========As little dynamic as possible with a clear mapping```ts// Leading Entity DataSource{ \"projectID-1\": { // define project ID \"entityTypeID-1\": { // define entity type ID // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields ) } }}// Following Entity To Entity DataSource ( one to one mapping ){ \"parent-projectID-1\": { // define parent project ID \"parent-entityTypeID-1\": { // define parent entity type ID \"parent-linkDefinitionID-1\": { // define link definition ID fromTypes: { // specific link direction ( opposite is toTypes ) \"projectID-1\": { // define project ID \"entityTypeID-2\": { // define entity type ID // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields ) } } } } } }}```This structure gives you a lot more flexibility and the backend exactly knows what to do. Unfortunately I wasn't able to solve the filter part yet. How should I tell the backend> Pick this one if its status is \"open\" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.Reading every risk and applying a filter which checks every hazard relative to this risk can cause a massive slowdown ( when having many data sources )\"use SQL\" idea========It would be easy to create a custom SQL string and pass it to the backend plugin which passes the SQL query to the system. Unfortunately this is not possible because- The system would block complex queries- There are no permission checks anymore\"use Lucene\" idea========One could create a Lucene query string. While Lucene itself allows arbitrarily complex logical structures, the system enforces a few practical restrictions:- Security & Performance:Extremely deep nesting or very long OR chains (e.g., thousands of values) may be rejected by the system- Syntax filtering:The system only supports a subset of Lucene’s query syntax (for example, no wildcards in field names, no custom analyzer queries)- Fixed field names:You can only query fields that the system has indexed (e.g., type, status, severity, assignee, project, created, etc.)Complex queries not only check for field values but also for graphs and Lucene is not a graph database system.\"filters\" idea========Think of everything being a ( known ) filter```ts// caution: this filter structure needs to be logically nested inside AND / OR / NOT{ /* Glob Pattern, e.g. \"100\" => Project 100 only \"!100\" => All projects except 100 \"100|200\" => Project 100 or 200 only \"*\" => All projects */ projectID: \"100\", entityTypeID: \"risk\", // Glob pattern similiar to project ID // ... additional filters ...}```This might work but it takes some time to resolve the request. And for now I didn't find a good structure for a very complex domain filter.---My questions:-----Is there a standard query language solving this? I want to avoid inventing my own query language.Do you have any ideas how to create a generic structure being able to solve complex domain cases?",

        "content": "I lead a team at a mid-sized, top cybersecurity company in the US. I’m on an H1B and have delivered several high-impact projects that have contributed meaningfully to the company’s growth. At present, I manage a team of four engineers in the US, along with a QA we recently hired in our global office in India.Over the past few months, the company has largely stopped hiring or backfilling positions in the US. All new hires are now being made in India, and there have been a few layoffs here in the US, even though the company’s financial health remains strong.Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding H1B visas, I’ve decided that moving to India is the best choice for both my personal and professional stability. I approached management about transferring to our India office so I can be closer to my aging parents and have some peace of mind. While they expressed full support for the move, there’s a condition: they want me to build a new team in India.I can’t help feeling conflicted about this. I genuinely care about my US team, and I worry that some of them might face layoffs as a consequence of these changes. It’s a difficult situation, balancing my personal needs with my responsibilities toward my colleagues.At the end of the day, H1B isn’t really the problem here, it’s outsourcing and the global cost-cutting strategies like GCC that are driving these shifts.",

This is obviously against the countless clarification that's been published, so I asked where heard that. They said company announcement and emails from the law firm that the company pays.That's why Big Tech has is keeping its mouth shut about the 100k H1B fees. It won't affect the majority of their hiring, not transfers, not F1, etc. but they can use the panic to insinuate that it does to suppress wages. \"You should be grateful we're paying this fee, and other employers might not when you switch jobs.\" You didn't pay shit, and neither would anyone else. \"Now we have to pay everyone less to cover the fees, blah blah blah bs\"The 100k \"fee\" is a win for Big Tech because their hiring is untouched by it and allows them to keep wages low by manipulating their H1Bs into thinking switching cost is even higher. I bet they're actively lobbying for the fee to apply to job switch. Anyone else seeing this bullshit?",

I had barely settled in and was still getting used to the new environment. It felt like they were never serious about hiring me from the start considering I could just get let go randomly on my 2nd day, but it's also extremely unfair to me having quit my job at big tech and leaving my friends and family to move across the world to work for them. Has anyone had such an experience before before? Is this a common thing among AI startups right now where hiring-and-firing is just part of the culture?Anyhow, I am now stuck in San Francisco alone with a 60-day window to find a new job before my visa runs out. If anyone has any advice on how to get through this period, or could refer me to any opportunities in backend, AI, ML, or infrastructure engineering roles in the Bay Area, it would mean everything to me. I have experience as a backend engineer working on large-scale AI/ML infrastructure at big tech, and also full-stack development across smaller companies. I'm open to any types of companies at this point and will put in my best work wherever I end up next.",

        "author": "diabloallica",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Earlier this year, I shared a post about my *brutal job search season* — 7 years of experience, 0 offers, and a Sankey diagram of all my failures. At that time, I was struggling to get traction despite a ton of effort, and the funnel felt brutal. (For anyone curious, here’s the old post: [Brutal Job Search Season Recap - 7 YOE, 0 Offers, and a Sankey Diagram of My Failures : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1irlf8b/brutal_job_search_season_recap_7_yoe_0_offers_and/))This time around, things went much better. With \\~7.5 years of experience at a major cloud company, I decided to give the market another shot, and the difference was noticeable. I ended up landing **5 job offers, all at a higher level than my current role**, and had far more interview opportunities with larger, well-known companies compared to my last search.**What Changed Since Last Time:*** **Market conditions:** Hiring still isn’t easy, but compared to earlier this year, there’s clearly more activity. The bar is high, but not *as impossibly high*.* **Interview prep:** I doubled down on my weak spots. Coding used to be my #1 rejection reason. I kept grinding on patterns, mock interviews, and actually slowing down to talk through my thinking. That helped a lot.* **Mindset:** Last time, every rejection hit me hard. This time, I treated each round as “just another rep,” which helped me stay consistent across system design and behavioral interviews.**Results:*** Multiple onsites and final-round loops.* 5 actual offers on the table (finally!).* A more balanced funnel: coding wasn’t the auto-fail it used to be, and system design performance felt steadier.**Takeaways:**1. The market does ebb and flow. Timing matters more than we admit.2. Interviewing is a skill that compounds. The “wasted” interviews from earlier weren’t really wasted; they set me up to do better this time.3. Having \\~7 years of experience doesn’t exempt you from practicing fundamentals. But it *does* give you more stories and perspective for behavioral/design rounds.Curious: has anyone else noticed interviews feeling slightly more reasonable lately? Or was this just lucky timing?**New Sankey diagrams:**[https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg](https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg) \\- Without any failure reason categorization [https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2](https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2) \\- With weighted failure reason categorization",

This has caused me to perpetuate the AI fear myself and for that I feel pretty shitty. I even contemplated throwing my CS degree away and becoming an electrician. I’m deciding after this post, I will monitor responses for 24 hours and then delete Reddit, stop looking at TeamBlind, and stop watching YouTube doom videos. I will completely ignore all of this for the next 6 months and focus on becoming a better developer. Will it be a waste of my time? Maybe. But I have come to realize all I can do is the best I can, I can’t control the future. I urge anyone that is similar doomscrolling such as myself to take a similar hiatus and focus on growing your skills. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",

I did my bachelor’s at WGU and would probably go that route again since I could likely finish a master’s in about 6 months, making it effectively free to me.Right now, I’m not sure any of these options would directly change my position or pay in the short term, but I want to optimize for the future and keep doors open for higher-paying roles, whether as an IC or a manager. Here are the contenders:1. M.S. in Software Engineering - Closest to what I do now. Could help fill in gaps in areas I haven’t worked in, but not sure how much employability upside it really has.2. M.S. in Computer Science - The title alone sounds stronger than Software Engineering. Has AI specializations that align with my new role. Might make me stand out more technically down the road.3. MBA in IT Management - I’m interested in becoming an engineering manager eventually, but I don’t know how much a specialization like this actually matters for that.4. General MBA - The broadest option. If specialization doesn’t matter much, maybe this is better? Could also hedge for a career pivot (not planning one, but never hurts).5. None - Maybe all of these are just a waste of time, energy, and opportunity cost :'(Has anyone here gone through one of these paths or similar? Did it actually help your career or comp long-term? Would love some real-world perspective from people who’ve been there. Thanks!",

It's been 7 months now of sending out hundreds of applications, and honestly I'm starting to feel pretty lost about what I should even be doing at this point.I graduated with my CS degree in 2023 and spent about 2 years working as an Application Engineer at a major financial company. My day-to-day was mainly building AWS Lambda functions and Glue jobs in Python to handle data integrations - stuff like pulling Bloomberg PORT data into AWS Athena so fund managers could do risk analysis. I also developed SQL queries and workflows to migrate derivatives and fund data between our internal databases and external platforms like MSCI. I was maintaining and monitoring about 5 enterprise ETL processes that ran daily, handling gigabytes of financial data, and I spent a lot of time on production incident resolution.My tech stack was mainly Python, AWS, SQL with PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, Pandas, NumPy, and some Tableau. So I wasn't doing pure software development - it was more data engineering and integration focused work.Here's where I'm struggling. I do get some responses to applications - not many, but a few here and there. The problem is when I actually get to the interview stage, I'm struggling badly. I've gotten really rusty after 7 months out of the field, and interviewers dive way deeper into technical concepts than I expect. Things I used to know well - AWS integrations, ETL architecture, even some Python specifics - are getting fuzzy. I can talk about what I did at a high level, but when they start asking detailed technical questions or want me to architect something on the spot, I'm just not sharp anymore. It's like I know I used to understand this stuff, but I can't access it quickly enough in the moment.On top of that, I genuinely don't know what jobs I should even be targeting with my background. My title was \"Application Engineer\" but the work was really data engineering and integration heavy. Should I be going for Data Engineer roles? Backend Engineer? DevOps or Platform Engineer positions? Cloud Engineer roles? I honestly don't know anymore, and I think I might be applying to the wrong types of positions entirely, which is why the interviews feel so mismatched when I do get them.I'm also struggling with how to describe what I actually did. When I write \"data integration\" and \"ETL maintenance\" on my resume, it sounds way less impressive than the work actually was, but I don't know how to articulate the complexity without sounding like I'm overselling it. And the market being brutal right now isn't helping - I know 2025 has been terrible for everyone, but getting through interviews when I'm this rusty is becoming impossible.I'm at the point where I'm considering a few different paths but I'm not sure which makes sense. Maybe I should take some time to rebuild my skills systematically before continuing to interview, possibly through grad courses or something structured. Maybe I should pivot to a different type of role that's easier to break into right now. Or maybe I just need to figure out how to prep better for these deep technical interviews. Honestly, I don't know anymore.So I guess my questions for this community are: Based on the experience I described, what job titles and roles should I actually be targeting? I feel like I'm applying to positions that don't quite match my background and that's showing up in interviews. How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field? What's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews? Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?The problem is I'm bombing them because I'm not technically sharp anymore. I need tactical guidance on whether I should pause and rebuild skills first, or if there's a way to prep more effectively for these deep technical conversations. Any honest feedback would be really appreciated because I'm genuinely lost here.",

        "content": "Hi all,I’m finishing up a PhD in CS at a top U.S. school (think Stanford, MIT, CMU, or Berkeley). I recently received an industry offer that isn’t research-oriented (no publications involved), and I’m torn between taking it and graduating soon or going on the academic job market.For context, I have 10+ first-author papers at top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) with around 400 citations in total. My advisor says I’m one of the best students they’ve had in the past decade and that I should be able to land a tenure-track position at a top institution.In terms of compensation, I can expect around $400–500K total in industry (with a $300K base). Assistant professors in my field at top schools seem to start around $160–180K including summer support and benefits. Tenured associate professors make roughly $220K+, full professors around $280K+, and side consulting can add a meaningful amount on top of that.Here’s my dilemma: I’m completely burned out from the publish-or-perish sprint. It feels impossible to truly rest from research, it follows you even into your dreams. I also sometimes feel empty producing papers that don’t seem to have much real-world relevance. Maybe things would get better once I settle into a tenure-track position with more autonomy, but I’m not sure. I don’t hate research, but the passion I once had for it is gone. These days, it feels more like a job I need to perform well in general at rather than something I’m genuinely excited about.That said, I absolutely love the flexibility and freedom academia offers. Being able to set my own schedule, take time off when needed, and choose topics that genuinely interest me has been invaluable. You also get summers (mostly) off from teaching and service, plus sabbaticals down the line. Most importantly, I find mentoring and teaching students incredibly meaningful in a way that publishing papers never has been. That’s the kind of “impact” that actually feels real to me.So… how do you decide between academia and industry when the pros and cons barely overlap? And is it reasonable to pursue an academic career if you don’t love research anymore, but deeply enjoy teaching and mentoring?I know no one can make this decision for me, but I’m feeling pretty lost right now and would really appreciate any perspectives or advice.Thanks a lot for reading.",

I've actively been trying to recruit some old out-of-work coworkers to this role at a FAANG over the past few months and if they aren't just opposed to part-time RTO their response is almost a universal \"I'd be open to a developer role.\" I don't really understand this philosophy for the people who are acting like AI killed their career or are otherwise frantically job hunting. To me the writing is on the wall: these roles seem to be replacing \"full stack\" developer roles in a lot of companies. The scope of \"full stack\" has changed significantly over the last several years and the way that the hyperscalers and big business alike are operating if your skills don't cross over into cloud/infra management you're simply not going to be able to meet their needs for a high paying role anymore. The only exceptions to that of course seem to be ML engineers or the work that rides even closer to the hardware than the SRE role demands. I've said this many times before, AI isn't killing the CS industry, but it is definitely reshaping it.Edit: I'm not offering referrals to strangers. Modern AI chat bots can review your resume and offer solid advice on filling knowledge gaps for these roles.",

I only really spent a few years as a pure application developer, and that whole time involved maintaining a relatively old ASP.NET application. As a supervisor I led a team working on a TypeScript web application using a number of more modern tools, but my focus was divided between active development and project management/team management.As a senior dev, it’s clear to me that there’s an expectation that I’m in a position to mentor less experienced devs and to lead work on our projects, as well as to be comfortable making high-level architecture decisions. Across the board, I just don’t feel like I have more experience or knowledge than the devs at a lower level.At the end of the day, I feel like I’m a mid-level dev who got hired as a senior, and continually feeling underqualified has me stressed. How do I build that experience? Should I consider looking for a different role that isn’t at a more senior level?",

I spend most of my time fighting with people over things that really don't matter, trying to decode a bunch of corporate jargon, and trying to navigate navigate corporate politicsI feel like I've never doubted my ability to deliver on anything that anyone wants in my domain (frontend), it's usually just an oddly bureaucratic set of hoops to jump through to get even the most basic things done. 90% of time is just spent communicating to higher ups, and only a minuscule fraction of time is available for coding.

The one I'm seeking out is a temp-to-hire, so a 30-90 day probationary period depending on performance. It pays double what I'm making right now. Here's some considerations:- My job right now is stable, at a well established company with little chances of being let go, but no room for salary or career growth.- The new job is performance based, and a new subsidiary of a bigger company so a bigger risk- The new job requires a skill set I'm a bit out of practice with so it will likely require a lot of hard work to get skilled up - The parent company is well funded and well established - New job is paying double what I'm making now with more potential for growth - I don't have kids, my expenses are reasonable, and I have savings and experience as a fallbackPlease let me know what you all think, thank you!",

        "author": "decorumic",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently got a job offer this week that I honestly never thought I’d get. It’s a SWE role at a pretty well-known Web3 company with a more than 30% total comp increase (about 265k vs my current 200k) and it's fully remote. The only catch is it's likely going to be intense with tight sprints, and fast-paced. I heard that they have a culture where people typically stay 1–2 years before moving on. But it's definitely a good place to make money.My **c**urrent job has pretty good job security at a company that works for the G. If I were to be honest to myself, I only do about 5 hours of real work per day. I go to the office twice a week for 30 mins each way. There are downsides (occasional confusion from unstructured sprints, tedious work, little growth), but overall it’s comfortable. But if I leave this job, it's quite difficult to return if I ever regret.The thing is I’ve always had this itch and dream of building my own product or small business someday. My logic was that this comfortable job would give me the time and space to pursue that dream. But in realityI haven’t much, just a tiny bit. I’ve been spending my extra time moving places, doing hobbies, or just unwinding.It makes me question if I can even trust myself to use free time productively for a side business. I don’t even have a concrete idea yet, just vague thoughts about building a micro-SaaS, but the market’s competitive and I’m not sure what problem to tackle.So now I’m torn because if I stay, I get comfort, stability, low stress but I risk stagnation and feel stupid leaving a lot of money on the table. And if I leave, I get more money, growth, and momentum but likely lose my free time and might burn out kept thinking of not scratching my itch.I’m nearing 40 already, so I also think about whether I should be prioritising stability or taking one last big career leap while I still can while I'm starting a family at the same time.How should I even decide especially for the long term?",

The reason I'm asking is because I don't have a degree and I'm thinking about getting a cyber security or computer science degree from WGU. The second reason I'm asking is because a lot of the IT jobs are on site or hybrid and since I live in a small town, I have to drive an hour both ways everyday, which is exhausting. And of course the pay is higher in software engineering than it is in IT. One last thing, since I have experience in IT and do security (pentesting) training on my own as a hobby (CTF's), I could get the cybersecurity degree in about 7 to 8 months.

        "content": "I feel like my job search is going nowhere, about 1000 applications in and nothing has really stuck (only a few calls recently, most recent one was for a place hundreds of miles away paying $45k that still said no)Every position out there gets 100s to 1000s of applicants so I have to be top 1% or top 0.1% to get any chance of getting anything. Things are especially bad because all the entry level positions get flooded by people with experience who are obviously better than me in every way? There's also no more spring 2025 positions pretty much, like all those new grad positions don't even have an option to say I've graduated in spring 2025 outside of the \"other\" option which means my application would probably get thrown out instantly.Experience wise I am in a bad spot, I don't have very much \"real\" internship experience, the past 4 summers in college I was at a small 1 guy + random interns place where I did random hardware ish projects with PLCs. Some years I had projects where I made a mini server and made some pages with PHP and Javascript, another year I made a small app for Zoom meetings on a headset, but none of that really counts as real stuff because I don't have any real metrics for them (because I don't have any relationship with the companies my boss was making stuff for, I can't just ask them to give me months of random data for me to see exactly how much money the thing I did made?). My parents put my old resume in ChatGPT and got something that just looks so much worse to me? It ended up making those 4 summers into one thing which to me just looks like a complete lie. Background check would immediately see that I only did like 12 months instead of 4 consecutive years or even without a background check they would think I am completely lying because I can't work a full time in person internship in one city and go to college full time in person 100 miles away, that is not believable. Should I just put that lie there anyway???But that's all in the past now, I have to do something to make myself more hireable now before my qualifications drop to zero, but I just don't know what. I can't really do networking because there's basically nothing in the way of local software openings. Befriending some random in some company isn't really going to help me unless they are someone really high up, but I just don't have that kind of charisma to make myself the best friend of some hiring person to the point that I will get in instead of all the much higher qualified people out there.Project wise I am in a bad spot too. Some college classes gave me some stuff to put on there, one class had a group project where our group made a web app with React and Firebase but that doesn't really mean much as it wasn't a \"real\" project with big profit numbers and impressive metrics of any kind. I also spent a year in high school making a old game mod with assembly but that doesn't really count because assembly code is not something anyone is hiring at entry level. It has a playerbase that I estimated to be roughly 5000+ but that doesn't really count for anything because it's not a dollar value.I just can't think of a good project to do that has anything \"impressive\" or would lead to massively impressive metrics? The only real metrics they care about are dollar values? Because anything other than those aren't really \"impressive\" (it doesn't matter if you've written X lines of code or worked with a database of X size or had X users or used X different programming languages or technologies because they don't really care about that). I don't know how to turn a profit as a guy who isn't an entrepreneur, marketer or good artist. Everything out there bangs on about those stupid metrics and it just frustrates me to no end. Because I don't know how to make anything impressive at all. I can't really think of something that distinguishes \"stupid toy project\" vs \"something hiring people are impressed by\" outside of something profitable or something made specifically for that company (which is just infeasible for me to do, I can't spend months on a massive project just to apply to a single company and have those hiring people not even bother looking).I also don't really have good answers to all the STAR questions they ask? Because I never have a result that's better than \"it got done\" or something similar. Like I keep repeating in this post I don't have metrics and I don't know how to make a project that makes those metrics happen. I also don't have good answers for their other kind of questions like \"explain a time where you had a conflict with a coworker\" because I don't have experience like that (the worst that happened to the groups I was in was more like \"minor disagreement that gets resolved in 1 minute\", I just don't have a compelling story about how all the group members were arguing for hours and then I stopped it in 1 second.). I also never have a good answer for \"why do you want to work for this company\" because I don't really care about random company #1000 I've applied to, I just can't give them the answer \"I have always strived to work for this specific company and I have never applied to anything else and I will die for this company that I've only heard of when I saw the job posting\"",

I'm currently at a point where I want to leave and take some time off after working for 10+ years without any sort of extended time off. I plan to take 3-6 months to do some career reflection, ski, spend time with family/friends, and travel.I want to get some thoughts here provided the following information: 1. Financially I have roughly \\~100k in cash and another 100k in the stock market. Monthly rent is 2.5k 2. I'm initially planning to put my two weeks in mid January prior to my planned Japan Ski trip in February Timing is key here as I do need to stay for the rest of the year to qualify for bonus + 401k contribution for the fiscal year. Question to you guys is would you go with the initial plan of putting in the two weeks in mid January or continue to quiet quit until ski season is over? Financially speaking I do think I should be fine sticking to my original plan which is to put in the two weeks in January. But coming from a family where my parents were immigrants and struggling to feed two kids, I do have some PTDSD with money and it makes me a little worried. I know some individuals will point out that it's not ideal to do this in this economy, but I also know that I'm in a point of my career where if I don't take some time off now, I will never have the opportunity to do so as I currently don't have any kids. For context, I am an EM right now and will be looking for EM roles after taking time off. Let me know what you guys think. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated!",

Because my previous roles had me at the intersection of business and technology, my goal (known by my management team) is to eventually transition to the \"business side\" of our team/very well known company. I know that ideally I need to get credentials other than an associates degree, given today's market. I’ve been pricing out a CS Bachelor's degree and the time it would take to finish... I’m looking at like 3.5 years and $65k. That’s a lot. While I was doing this, I ended up coming across an opportunity to complete a Master’s Degree in CS (it is a performance based admissions which accepts applicants w/o a bachelor’s) at a reputable, accredited school  (CU Boulder Online) for 1/2 the time and a fraction of the cost.I know that given my current career trajectory, having that Master's would be really helpful to me. I also have credits in business that are transferrable, and found out that I could get an online BS in business from WGU in a relatively short amount of time (less than one year). Would having a Master's degree in CS without a CS bachelor (instead bachelor would be in business) be a detriment to me in applying/changing jobs/getting my resume through an ATS system in the future for tech and related roles that I cannot think of at the moment?I am just afraid that not having the CS Bachelor would be a deterrent. I am over 30 and being able to do these degrees online and specifically have the technology degree being \"higher level\" to match my skill set, would make it a lot easier to get through.  I figured this is an OK strategy, but I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot…maybe someone can see a risk that I can't.Thank you!P.S. - Edited to add:  My friend who is a manager said that the Master's would be good for leveling up in our system, but that it could potentially exclude me from job reqs that require a BS in CS... so that is what has me nervous about going down this path. However, I have been seeing more job posts in our system for 'Bachelor's Degree' and it doesn't say any specific disipline, whereas before many of our postings would say Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or Higher/Equivalent Experince. Our company is also very open to people with 'different' backgrounds as long as they can 'prove' they have the skills to do the work. With this in mind, do you think purely getting the Master's is a determent (and BS in CS is better) or is it a worthwhile path to pursue to get the MS as I have already planned? Thank you!",

        "content": "I was laid off earlier this year from my first job at a startup, and have been on the job market ever since. Counting internships, I have about 1.5 years of total experience (without internships, I only have 3 months). I graduated with a masters degree in December 2023 (only coursework, no thesis) and then spent some time unemployed before finding my first role.Since entry level is only going to get more competitive, I'm thinking of doing another masters degree if I cannot find anything by the end of this year. Is this the ideal way to proceed? Right now, I'm pursuing personal projects, maintaining my Medium blog and building projects in public. Money is not an obstacle for me (in-state tuition is cheaper).While doing this will definitely buy me more time and save me from having a huge career gap, I would be making a gamble that this period will allow me to network more and get one internship that would hopefully convert to a full time offer. Also, I would need to figure out how to get updated recommendation letters, which is not going to be easy with this time gap...Has anyone gone through this similar situation and ended up going back to school? I would appreciate relevant feedback on this.Thanks everyone!Edit: Some of you have asked for my resume, so I've attached it here: [https://imgur.com/a/most-recent-resume-with-no-personal-info-dXreCWe](https://imgur.com/a/most-recent-resume-with-no-personal-info-dXreCWe)",

They told me it's different this time because the contract was more stable since it's not a federal contract but it's still a massive risk to quit my current job for $27/hr. There's also the $10K breach clause which I think is a red flag. Last time, when I was in their pipeline before, they explained to me that the $10K breach clause was set because of how expensive the security clearance process was. That's fine with me, but now they're telling me that there's no need for a security clearance for this role and the breach clause is still set at $10K. I'm just curious, is there anybody that currently works with SkillStorm that can vouch for them? Is there anybody in the same boat as I am?",

I think I'd be happier helping those who actually need help, in this case, students.* Work-life balance - It feels extremely prevalent nowadays, at all levels (jr, mid, senior, etc), to be expected to push above and beyond, both during and after work hours. I'm not saying that teaching is easy and doesn't require planning/marking outside of work, but I feel that this is less often and demanding in comparison. I would like to keep my peace of mind after work hours.I think generally my strengths align with teaching, and that this would be a more fulfilling career.Is there anything I would regret?Some obvious things that come to mind:* Salary difference, especially early on.* Longer establishment time (2 years for teachers college, then supply teaching, etc.)Thank you in advance!",

Maybe a lot of the ones without much luck are international.

I graduated in May and have been fortunate enough to get a software engineering job at a small start up and have been learning a lot the last three months. I didn't use AI for coding at all in college, which seems to be uncommon since it came out a couple months into my freshman year, but I cared too much about learning things for myself and the satisfaction of coding to bother with it much. When I started my job, our lead/senior dev encouraged using AI to speed up processes and handle some tedious tasks. I've been using ChatGPT for writing unit tests, doing more difficult research and bug finding, etc. which are things that I was asked to do to speed things up. I am cool with using it as a tool to augment my programming and I'm sure it does speed things up. Recently, they've had me install Cursor, which again, I admit is cool and it works, but what the hell is the point of being a software engineer with this? I'm told I still need to know what I am doing, still need to do research into what libraries and patterns to use, review the generated code, etc. but I'm starting feeling like I entered this field too late to actually be a programmer if this is the new expectation. I don't want to push back on using Cursor, but I want to be writing my own code. I don't want to fall behind in efficiency when the other two engineers are heavily using Cursor, but I don't want to lose the skill of coding and problem solving for myself. Is there some balance that I can strike, or do I just need to cope with AI taking the joy and satisfaction out of this job?

Spent months looking for a job and eventually landed a job in model risk at the associate level at a T1 bank in NYC focused on AI/ML models. This *felt* tech-adjacent enough that, as someone who had been searching for a job for a long time, I felt like I was obligated to take it. So I did.The role is ok. Definitely boring, only a bit of coding but alot of looking at code. It's close enough to the models themselves that I feel like I'm maintaining my technical chops. But I'm realizing that being at a bank is just not for me and I want to do something closer to the action. I've only been here for a few months but I fully intend to try and leave model risk after a year or two at this job.Not gonna lie, I've been kind of spiraling a bit lately since I've been scared that I've already boxed myself into a risk/compliance archetype that'll make it impossible to pivot to anything more exciting. Part of this is just the fact that model risk is an area thats kind of unique to banks and thus less transferable, but my cope is that since I'm working with AI/ML models more than financial models, that makes me marginally more \"tech-adjacent\" if you will. Ideally I would land a role in as a PM or TPM in AI/Responsible AI, as those *feel* like more natural pivots than trying to immediately start coding full-time again, but I worry about how my background will be perceived.This is my first full time role. Maybe I'm just overestimating how rigid career trajectories and exit opportunities and those things are. I just don't wanna be stuck doing this for the rest of my life. Yeah it pays pretty well but it's not fulfilling or exciting. Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated on how I should try to approach the next year or so to angle myself best",

I know the new company puts a lot of investment in their employees like my current one does though.Also my wife really wants to be a stay at home mom soon and this gets us closer to that goal.",

        "content": "I’m looking for advice on how to improve my resume and job search strategy. I recently graduated and did an internship during my program at a non-tech company. My manager verbally promised a full-time offer after graduation, so I made the mistake assuming things will work out without preparing properly. I stopped applying and didn’t polish my resume, thinking the offer was guaranteed. But after I graduated, my manager told me the company wasn’t doing well and couldn’t hire me. He asked me to wait until next year to see if things change.I started applying in August and I know it was late. I asked my college advisor to help me revise my resume, and I’ve since applied to around 300 applications. So far, I’ve only received 2 interviews and 3 OA. I’ve been grinding LeetCode and working on side projects to make my resume stronger. But I’m not sure what else I should be doing.If anyone is willing to take a look at my resume or share advice on how to improve my chances, I’d really appreciate it.Resume: [https://imgur.com/a/B0e82h7](https://imgur.com/a/B0e82h7)",

In the first company, I advanced really quickly and ended up being responsible for pretty much the entire web side of things (for a Fortune 500 in finance). In the second company, I was given a “senior” role right away and did a lot over 1.5 years with front end (webflow, some react and lots of vanilla J's and jqery lol).After about six years of total experience, I decided to fully switch to coding. I had been doing side projects for a while, and after around 7–8 months of consistent coding and building projects, I landed a Next.js position where I now handle both design and development, and spend about 90% of my time in Next.js.My question is: besides learning on the job, I still sometimes feel like studying or building things on my own. What would be the most useful thing to add to my skillset?I already have a few full-stack apps under my belt, but I’m wondering if it’s better to go deeper into backend and architecture on my own projects since most of my work is front end, or just focus on shipping smaller but complete apps.Things I’m interested in are:GoElixirAWSI’m not trying to collect technologies just for the sake of it - I really want to build something more complex and learn deeply. So, what would make the most sense to focus on (maybe something else entirely) if my goal is to improve my chances of finding a job in another country down the line(I am Serbian)? My girlfriend is in the EU and we’re planning to move to an EU country soon, so I want to make myself as employable as possible (I am 28).Thanks!",

Everything is pretty good (work-life balance, team culture, etc.). The work is interesting and I'm optimistic and at least semi-interested in the product. I've gone from entry level to senior on this team, and can still have career progression here.However, I feel my technical skills have been stagnating. There isn't much engineering mentorship, so I haven't been learning better engineers. If I got laid off today, I don't think future jobs would think my skills match my resume/level. Additionally, my role is very specialized, so I'm being pigeonholed in where I can work, since despite being senior, I lack a breadth of experience.Dilemma: I was offered an internal transfer role to a team doing something completely different, and has many higher level engineers to learn from. However, there are lots of unknowns. The product itself seems much less interesting, and of course there is no telling how the people are to work with or the team culture.What would you do in this situation? Stay where you're at, happy currently, but letting my growth stagnate and potentially limiting my options in the future, or take a leap of faith in order to gain experience?Thanks in advance!",

I can take online courses but can’t really enroll into university again to take a degree.2) If I’m to switch, which courses should i be taking that would be really good on Cvs?3) Does data analysis include statistics?
