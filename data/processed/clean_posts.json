        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering  :waving_hand:I’ve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that’s always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built [ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.# So, how does it work?ToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.# Connects to everything* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.* Any API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even internal APIs)# Why you'll love it* **Zero configuration:** Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g. * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.If you’re building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!**Docs:** [https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)**GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)A :star: on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

I am one of those people who transitioned to DA from science. The majority of what I know was self taught. In my previous job I worked as a researcher but I taught myself python and wrote a lot of pandas code in that role. The size of the data my old lab worked with was small but with the small amount of data I had access to I was able to build some simple python dashboards and automate processes for the lab. I also spent a lot of time in that job learning SQL on the side. The python and SQL experience from my previous job allowed me to transition to my current job. I have been in my current job for two years. I am starting to think about the next step. The problem I am having is when I search for DA jobs in my area that fit my experience, I don't see a lot of jobs that offer salaries better than what I currently make. I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. I feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part. And *unlike* my previous job where I was able to teach myself python and implement it on the job, therefore having experience I could put on job applications, there aren't the same opportunities here. Or at least, I don't see how I can make those opportunities. Our data isn't in the cloud. We have a contracting company who handles the backend of our DB. We don't have a DE like team in house. I don't have access to a lot of modern DE tools at work. I can't even install them on my work PC. A lot of the work would have to be done at home, during my free time, in the form of personal projects. I wonder, are personal projects enough nowadays? Or do you need job experience to be competitive for DE jobs?",

We are heavily invested in databricks and power biProblem: Our business users want to drilldown, slice, and re-aggregate across upc, store, category, department, etc. it’s the perfect usecase for a cube, but we don’t have that. Our data model is too large to fit entirely into power bi memory, even with vertipaq compression and 400gb of memory. For reference, we are somewhere between 750gb-1tb depending on compression. The solution to this point is direct query on an XL SQL warehouse which is essentially running nonstop due to the SLAs we have. This is costing a fortune. Solutions thought of:- Pre aggregation: great in thought, unfortunately too many possibilities to pre calculate - Onelake: Microsoft of course suggested this to our leadership, and though this does enable fitting the data ‘in memory’, it would be expensive as well, and I personally don’t think power bi is designed for drill downs- Clickhouse: this seems like it might be better designed for the task at hand, and can still be integrated into power bi. Columnar, with some heavy optimizations. Open source is a plus. Also considered: Druid, SSAS (concerned about long term support plus other things)Im not sure if I’m falling for marketing with Clickhouse or if it really would make the most sense here. What am I missing? EDIT: i appreciate the thoughts this far. The theme of responses has been to pushback or change process. I’m not saying that won’t end up being the answer, but I would like to have all my ducks in a row and understand all the technical options before I go forward to leadership on this.",

        "content": "Hi, at my company we’re currently building a data platform using Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to provide a central place for analysts and other stakeholders to access and work with reports and data.Fabric looks promising as an all-in-one solution, but we’ve run into a challenge: many of the features are still marked as Preview, and in some cases they don’t work as reliably as we’d like.That got us thinking: should we fully commit to Fabric, or consider switching parts of the stack to open source projects? With open source, we’d likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:⁠- flexible server scaling based on demand- potentially lower costs- more flexibility in how we handle different workloadsOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.Any insights would be super helpful as we’re evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",

The constant context-switching to answer simple questions for marketing, sales, or product folks was a huge drain on my productivity.So, I started working on a side project to see if I could build a better way. The result is something I'm calling DBdash.The idea is simple: it’s a tool that lets you (or your less-technical stakeholders) ask questions in plain English, and it returns a verified answer, a chart, and just as importantly, the exact SQL query it ran.My biggest priority was building something that engineers could actually trust. There are no black boxes here. You can audit the SQL for every single query to confirm the logic. The goal isn't to replace analysts or engineers, but to handle that first layer of simple, repetitive questions and free us up for more complex work.It connects directly to your database (Postgres and MySQL supported for now) and is designed to be set up in a few minutes. Your data stays in your warehouse.I'm getting close to a wider launch and would love to get some honest, direct feedback from the pros in this community.\\* Does this seem like a tool that would actually solve a problem for you? \\* What are the immediate red flags or potential security concerns that come to mind? \\* What features would be an absolute must-have for you to consider trying it?You can check out the landing page here: [https://dbdash.app](https://dbdash.app)It's still in early access, but I'm really keen to hear what this community thinks.

The challenge is that I don’t have a university degree or any formal training in the field. Everything I know, I learned through hands-on experience and self-study. I’m solely responsible for the BI area at my company (with basic support from an assistant), and the company has an annual revenue of around R$1.2 billion.Recently, I developed a full Power BI solution from scratch — handling everything from data extraction and organization to visualization — to monitor the entire operation of our distribution center, which I’ll be presenting next week. I have basic knowledge of SQL and Python, and I’m particularly interested in the technical and organizational aspects of working with data.My current role is Junior Analyst, but I’ll be evaluated for a promotion to Mid-level in October. I started in this field just over two years ago, from absolute zero, as an assistant. About a year ago, the specialist in our department resigned, and even though I was still an assistant, I stepped up to take on the role. It was very challenging at first, but over time I managed to handle the workload and deliver results. According to my manager, I’m expected to be promoted to Specialist by October 2026. Even without a formal degree, I’ve been able to solve the challenges that come my way.I’m 27 years old now, and I sometimes feel a bit late to start college. That’s why I’d like to hear your advice on the best path to land a Data Engineering position abroad. I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ve been studying and improving my skills, and I feel comfortable with the language. Thank you very much for your time and guidance.",

The challenge is that my analytical, direct approach is what made me good at the technical work, but it's not translating well to the business side.I've tried some of the usual suspects (Toastmasters, generic communication courses) but they all feel like they're designed for sales people or public speakers, not engineers. The advice is either shallow (e.g. pace, filler words) or in theory (e.g. DISC framework) which doesn't really help when your brain is wired to solve problems efficiently.**For those who've successfully made this transition - what actually moved the needle for you?** Looking for practical advice, not just \"practice more.\"Also, I'm working on something specifically for technical professionals facing this challenge. If you've been through this struggle, would you mind sharing your experience in a quick 8-question assessment?

I’ve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what [r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/) thinks.The basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:1. Download and extract bill data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS3. In parallel, extract member data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) API, concatenate, upload to GCS4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.A few observations / questions that came to mind:\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?https://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I’m not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it’s applicable to my day job.Thank you if you’ve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I’ve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

What factors would you consider when choosing the tool, especially regarding costs, limitations, and performance?I’d also appreciate any tips on partitioning and naming standards for files in the raw layer, to avoid issues with maintenance and pipeline evolution in the future.",

Raw (Bronze): Source data and simple views like renaming, parsing, casting columns.2. Staging (Bronze): Further cleaned datasets. I often end up finding that there needs to be a lot of additional work done on top of source data, such as joining tables together, building out incremental models on top of the source data, filtering out bad data, etc. It's still ultimately viewing the source data, but can have significantly more logic than just the raw layer.3. Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific. This is usually something like aggregated, unioned, denormalized datasets.Overall folder structure might be something like this:* raw * source\\_A * source\\_B* staging * source\\_A * source\\_B * intermediate* catalog * business\\_domain\\_1 * business\\_domain\\_2 * intermediate* reporting * report\\_X * report\\_Y * intermediateHistorically, the raw layer above was our staging layer, the staging layer above was an intermediate layer, and all intermediate steps were done in the same intermediate folder, which I feel has become unnecessarily tangled as we've scaled up.",

I believe this tool/webapp can be useful for data engineering devs and teams. I am looking for the communities feedback. To be honest, I have never shared any of my work publicly and I'm a bit nervous.So, the way PulseHook works is I have setup an api end point you can use to post from any of your scripts/jobs. You can send success and error status to this API endpoint. Also, you can setup the monitoring on the web app and enter email(s) and/or slack web hooks for notifications. If the api receives a failure status or job doesn't run in the intended duration, notification would be send to email(s) and/or slack. So, here is the webapp link - [https://www.pulsehook.app/](https://www.pulsehook.app/) . Currently, I have not setup any monetization and its free to use.

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first). In the above case, 1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.I want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).I would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).

        "author": "ephemeral404",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).Now that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.### What I liked about Pulsar:* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).### What's painful about Pulsar:* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debugWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. P.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.",

We have the same column name in the reporting & datamart layer. The table name and column name are identical, one layer just has IDs and the other brings in descriptions. The value is different. What's frustrating is we recently started doing design and code reviews but they're useless and implemented in a way it just checks the box while causing the least amount of resistance. A design review is 3-5m and a code review takes about the same amount of time. I joined this company to see how things work with larger teams but unfortunately is also limiting me from helping them more.",

        "content": "I've been looking for Data Integration Engineer jobs in the healthcare space lately, and that motivated me to build my own, rudimentary data ingestion engine based on how I think tools like Mirth, Rhapsody, or Boomi would work. I wanted to share it here to get feedback, especially from any data engineers working in the healthcare, public health, or healthtech space.The gist of the project is that it's a Dockerized pipeline that produces synthetic HL7 messages and then passes the data through a series of steps including ingestion, quality assurance checks, and conversion to FHIR. Everything is monitored and tracked with Prometheus and displayed with Grafana. Kafka is used as the message queue, and MinIO is used to replicate an S3 bucket.If you're the type of person that likes digging around in code, you can check the project out [here](https://github.com/bryanbritten/hl7-integration).If you're the type of person that would rather watch a video overview, you can check that out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3de54014865b4cb7aa59b87ec940626d?sid=271f23fd-7ade-4f82-864f-e2a288a96a36).I'd love to get feedback on what I'm getting right and what I could include to better represent my capacity for working as a Data Integration Engineer in healthcare. I am already planning to extend the segments and message types that are generated, and will be adding a terminology server (another Docker service) to facilitate working with LOINC, SNOMED, and IDC-10 values.Thanks in advance for checking my project out!",

And it has been 1y I have been promoted as data platform technical lead on a managed data platform dedicated mainly to industry and oil and gas. I like the role since I get to design, architect and build data products that are really bringing value to the business. I learnt that our company are signing a big contract with this data platform technology. This means more opportunity will be available for me inside the company. And I might transition to other projects after that the current project passes to the run phase. It is honestly exciting however I’m afraid to get locked to this technologie that it is again very niche and technologically speaking less sophisticated than other data platforms like Databricks. It does not yet incorporate lakehouse philosophie/ tools/ data formats for example. The one I’m working on it is more or less a managed spark cluster with many managed niche industry data source connectors.Also, we are early adopters of this data platform but it has been showing a consistent growth signs, for example Aramco is investing on them and is starting to be used by big oil and gas actors.I want to get your opinion on this situation, and whether you encountered a similar one and what did you do? do you think it’s a good thing to continue working and growing inside my company around this niche data platform or should I get more closer to databricks projects (my company is a big one and some projects are using databricks but much smaller projects with less impact )Thank you!",

We can ask for more storage via IT tickets, add compression and look into partitioning for performance. But none of those will really solve the issue in the long term.I’m wondering a couple of different things here:1) Does something like Hadoop need to be considered? Is a sql rdms the best opinion for data of this size on-prem?2) What learning resources to you recommend for understanding how to navigate this kind of thing? The all knowing gpt keeps suggesting designing data intensive applications and the data warehouse toolkit, both of which I have and neither really touches on this.Anyway, thanks to any on-prem homies who know the struggle and have advice.",

I created an assume role and got it trusted, got creds with sts client, used those creds to create s3 client, then boom my problems solved. I rewrite my code and my first complete code is completed.

We are reaching a point with new software coming in that we will need (i think anyway) a data warehouse to collate the data from different sources in one place to allow for easier Power BI Reporting. What are the best sources to look at for where to begin on this topic? I have been watching youtube videos but in terms of what product is best I haven't found much. I think anything like Snowflake would be overkill for us (We are a £100m construction company in the UK) - our largest table after 1 year of erp has 1.5m rows, so not enormous data. Any direction on where to start on this would be great",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new to data lakes and I'm facing a challenge with data replication.I've set up a data lake on AWS using S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL, and Athena for queries. I'm using AWS DMS to replicate data from an on-premises Oracle database to S3.The problem is with **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. DMS pulls all events from the archived redo logs, including inserts, updates, and deletes. This means my Parquet files in S3 have an `op` column that indicates the type of operation (`I`, `U`, `D`).For example, if I query my Oracle database for a specific order with ID `123`, I get a single record. But in Athena, I might get up to 30 records for that same order ID because it was updated many times. Worse, if a record is deleted in Oracle, it still exists in my Athena table, maybe with multiple update records and a final delete record.Essentially, my Athena table is a log of **events**, not the current **state** of the data.I've found a temporary fix by adding timestamp and SCN (System Change Number) columns, which lets me write complex queries to find the most recent state. But these queries are huge and cumbersome compared to simple queries in Oracle.I need a better solution for \"sanitizing\" the data. Parquet files are not designed for easy record deletion. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for this.How do you guys handle this?* Do you just accept the complex queries and leave the old records in S3?* Do you run a separate process, maybe an AWS Lambda function, to act as a \"garbage collector\" and delete the older records directly from S3?* Do you handle this directly in your ETL jobs (e.g., in AWS Glue)? I'm worried about the cost of this since Glue charges by the minute, and this seems like it would be a very expensive operation.I'm looking for tips and common strategies for deleting or handling these duplicate/event-based records.Thanks!",

        "author": "EveningUnlikely7253",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I hope this is the right sub to get some technical advice. I'm working on replicating the native “Total Sales by Referrer” report inside Shopify using the Fivetran Shopify connector.Goal: match Shopify’s Sales reports 1:1, so stakeholders don’t need to log in to Shopify to see the numbers.What I've tried so far:* Built a BigQuery query joining across order, balance\\_transaction, and customer\\_visit.* Used order.total\\_line\\_items\\_price, total\\_discounts, current\\_total\\_tax, total\\_shipping\\_price\\_set, current\\_total\\_duties\\_set for Shopify’s Gross/Discounts/Tax/Shipping/Duties definitions.* Parsed \\*\\_set JSON for presentment money vs shop money.* Pulled refunds from balance\\_transaction (type='refund') and applied them on the refund date (to match Shopify’s Sales report behavior).* Attribution: pulled utm\\_source/utm\\_medium/referrer\\_url from customer\\_visit for last-touch referrer, falling back to order.referring\\_site.* Tried to bucket traffic into direct / search / social / referral / email, and recently added a paid-vs-organic distinction (using UTM mediums and click IDs like gclid/fbclid).* For shipping country, we discovered Fivetran Shopify schema doesn’t always expose it consistently (sometimes as shipping\\_address\\_country, sometimes shipping\\_country), so we started parsing from the JSON row as a fallback.But nothing seems to match up, and I can't find the fields I need directly either. This is my first time trying to do something like this so I'm honestly lost on what I should be doing.If you’ve solved this problem before, I’d love to hear:* Which tables/fields you leaned on* How you handle attribution and refunds* Any pitfalls you ran into with Fivetran’s schema* Or even SQL snippets I could copyNote: This is a small time project I'm not looking to hire anyone to do",

The main goal is to avoid the *small files problem* when storing in **Delta Lake**.Here’s the flow I’ve come up with:1. **Raw Layer (JSON / Daily files)** * Store the raw daily files exactly as received from the source.2. **Staging Layer (Parquet/Delta per app – weekly files)** * Consolidate the daily files into weekly batches per app. * Apply validation, cleaning, and deduplication.3. **Bronze Unified Delta** * Repartition by `(date_load, app_reference)`. * Perform incremental merge from staging into bronze. * Run **OPTIMIZE + Z-Order** to keep performance.4. **Silver/Gold** * Consume data from the optimized bronze layer.:pushpin: My questions: Is this Raw → Staging (weekly consolidated) → Unified Bronze flow a good practice for handling *small files* in daily ingestion with low volume? Or would you recommend a different approach (e.g., compacting directly in bronze, relying on Databricks auto-optimize, etc.)?",

Snowflake - Data Warehousing, Task, Stored Procedure, Snowflake Scripting3. Azure - ADF, Blob StorageThese tech stacks are utilized to move data from A to B. A mostly would be a CRM, ERP or some source database. I haven't worked on Big data related techs apart from Redhsift and Snowflake(MPP Warehouse). As you can see, all the projects are for internal business stakeholders and not user facing.I have recently started to work on my fundamentals as a Data Engineer and also expanding my tech stack to Big data tools like Hadoop, Spark, Kafka. I am planning to experiment with personal project but I wont have enough real experience on those. Since I haven't worked as software engineer, I am not good with best practices.

My supervisor only knew about WordPress styling and the others were working in a completely different sector. I had applied too late for internships and didn’t want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.The supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.Now I’m studying a higher level degree in the same field. It’s something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.There is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.AI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.Long story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it’s been doing good. It’s like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself. That's also why I chose this path.",

Any advice on skills, projects, networking, or just surviving and learning on my own would be really appreciated.",

Honestly, some of these projects feel way out of reach compared to what I’ve learned in class so far. The nice part, though, is that working on them has given me a clearer idea of what kinds of classes I actually want to take. I’m guessing some formal education will help solidify the concepts I’ve only kind of pieced together on my own.That said, since it’s impossible to know *all* of CS before starting a project, do you ever feel like you end up abstracting concepts the wrong way because you don’t have the formal background yet? I usually just read articles and keep Googling until I get a working understanding of what I need, but sometimes I worry that I’m learning things “wrong.”",

Atm im adding features to a web-app, i have the UI down, but now it comes to implementing all the code that is required for the UI to function and there are SO many things i have to keep in mind, from all the different edge-cases to how i design classes and their interactions so they are versatile, easy to work with and integrate with existing features without causing too many bugs and so on.I can usually get this done pretty good, but before i start im allways stunlocked by that task for even multiple days, where i just stare at the code and UI-Mockup and cant start working because i dont know where to start and how i wanna do all this stuff. It takes so much time for my mind to come up with a design that is satisfying to me and clear enough that i can start implementing.So my question is: Do some of you who are more experienced have tips, tricks, anything that might help reduce that massive waste of time (thats what it feels like)? I guess what would help is to somehow write this stuff down or visualiize it with something like the Obsidian app, but i have no idea how to do this without wasting even more time.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I feel pretty lost right now and could use some advice.I study bioinformatics, and to graduate I need to pass C++ and Python (Data Structures) classes. The issue is… programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.My very first programming course happened only after I got into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck — partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: “I failed this once, I’ll fail it again.” Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.I actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.I’ve seen the advice “pick a project idea and use it to learn,” but I’ve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it’s useless to jump into projects if you’re still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.So I’m not really looking for project ideas right now — more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I’m really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I’m “too much of a bio/med” to ever be good at programming.If you’ve ever been stuck in a similar way, I’d also love to hear your stories — what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.It feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors — after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I’m just stuck and don’t want to waste another year circling the same fear.",

He recommended the book \"think python, how to think like a computer scientist\", but how else can I really grasp this concept of computer programming.

It's a BIG dream, I know.. but at least I have a very clear goal in mind. I don't know if that makes things better or worse. As a self-taught 2d animator, I'm no stranger to self inflicted pain... and I hope to achieve my goal, after however long it takes. Even if it eventually means teaming-up with other more skilled devs. For now, I need an advice on the best starting place to learn/approach Java.",

First semester I passed everything but second semester was a disaster. Not necessarily because I was too stupid but because I didn't do anything. I've done a lot of programming courses on the side for the last few years (learncpp.com, odinproject, etc) but it's not getting better.

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right? Are compilers written in machine code? Is there something beneath that? The BIOS? Some fundamental code on the processor itself?

        "content": "In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?This is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner’s first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it’s simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.There are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.Beyond that, there’s the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they’ll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?The answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.So, the debate is not just “Which language is best?” but also “What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”",

What I do enjoy is building stuff people actually use — whether it’s a little game, a Chrome extension, a script, or an app, it honestly makes my day when someone says they’re using something I made. Now I’m wondering with all the AI hype and the tough job market if it’s still worth going deep into software engineering, because ideally I’d like to land a dev job (preferably web or mobile) while also launching my own apps on the side. For context, I know Python/JS/C/C++, built some games in Godot, made a Chrome extension and some simple web apps (mainly using django), done a fair bit of LeetCode, and I’m already comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS/SQL. The thing is I’m not sure how to take it to the next level — is it just “keep building projects” or is there more to it? Should I focus on one tech stack, try different ones, or do something structured like The Odin Project even though I already know the basics?

        "content": "This is kind of a complex one, so context: I'm in my 13th semester in software engineering, about to graduate if everything goes well. I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. The protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. They wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.I spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.With that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. My experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. I talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: \"What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?\"They even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently \"Eclipse IDE\". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. All this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. I'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock. The protect is in docker containers that I've been trying to get to work for 3 days to no success.Is this something I should worry about? And is there anything I can do to actually learn things? I genuinely feel like I should start the career all over again",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.This is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.When it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.There's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.So many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.I can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I’d also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I’d ever stand out in any way.What surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.That shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.I know it’s tough because “just do more tickets” feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.Curious if anyone else has felt the same? Do you feel like you’re in the grind stage, or have you found other ways to break out of burnout?",

HAF had earlier tried to intervene in the Cisco case but was denied by California state courtsFour key outcomesThe court’s 31-page judgement outlined four major outcomes:> Affirmation of state authority: The CRD has the constitutional right to enforce anti-discrimination laws, including against caste-based discrimination.> Legitimacy of CRD actions: The lawsuit against Cisco Systems, a major California tech firm, was found to be a legitimate public enforcement action, not a private legal dispute.> Rejection of religious freedom argument: The court ruled that the CRD’s enforcement did not violate any First Amendment rights of Hindu Americans, dismissing the argument as “entirely unpersuasive.”> No standing for HAF: The court held that HAF does not represent all Hindu Americans and failed to show concrete links to the broader community. “Plaintiffs have shown no facts demonstrating actual activities, engagement, or funding mechanisms,” the judge wrote.https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/us-federal-court-backs-californias-fight-against-caste-discrimination",

Honestly, if you’re not willing to grind some LeetCode, you’re basically out of the running for a big chunk of companies.* Use AI to help prep for interviews I ended up landing my offer after a long take-home project (10–11 hours) and a final round where we dug deep into it.If relocation is an option, it really opens up your opportunities (though I get that’s not feasible for everyone).

And that makes the whole thing sooo **stressful** for everyone, especially for student/fresh grads.It's like we all forgot that you have a good career is by learning programing, not stressing about the job market, latest career tips, and comparing ourselves to others.that's why a lot are freaking out on this subreddit about the job market. Is it bad rn? maybe, idk I'm too young to know how was it back then. scrolling on reddit at this point is mostly just... desperation porn.For me as a student, I've decided to focus only on my data science studies and stop worrying about the \"latest career tips\" and \"The Perfect Roadmap\" and just do the thing that I'm supposed to do, study. I don't have to make a plan for my career or know how it's gonna be for me, I'm just gonna do the best chess move for me rn which is learning. \\*sigh\\* it's hard to mention the job market here without getting downvoted, at least this is my opinion.

        "content": "I work at a tech company in London, UK, and we recently opened up a junior developer position, which we posted online. Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.This really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there’s a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it’s unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.If you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between £30k to £40k.\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company’s internal recruitment information on the internet.\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

I was faced with a choice: quit altogether or find another way. I chose the longer path, a Computer Science degree, which meant an additional year of prerequisite coursework before I could even begin.I finally graduated in 2022, just as the tech job market began its downward spiral. Over the next few years, I managed only a handful of interviews. To stay in the game, I took on low-paying part-time contract work to build real-world experience, and I went to meetups to network and keep learning.Fast forward to today. I’ve just landed my first full-time role as a Backend Engineer in a mid-cost-of-living area, earning a decent starting wage for that area. It may not be the biggest salary, but to me, it represents something much greater, a milestone I’ve been working toward for years.My biggest takeaway: don’t give up. There were plenty of times when I thought about it, especially as I watched peers move on or quit altogether. But persistence and consistency paid off.",

Obviously you can’t be expert on both even though resume clearly shows I’ve delivered and can explain. Interview has become a dice game.

I do have lots of savings to last me years but I also think having a gap can only hurt my future search. Not sure how true this is nowadays.Thanks",

Many responses were very detailed and thoughtful. Your insight can help.Here is a summary of the key points I took away. Some are in conflict with one another.1. A good honest attitude, curiosity, team orientated and leadership experience is very desirable. Add resume items that demonstrate this, not just say it.2. Hiring managers are looking for passion and self learners. Show evidence, not just say it.3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.4. Take contract work to build experience5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the organization used that to assess you.7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.12. The market is so tight that experienced devs available and preferred.13. Its a numbers game. Most candidates are similar. So just apply a lot and wish for luck!14. Apply as close to the posting of the job as possible. Those are considered first.15. Know the company well at interview time 16. Chances are better at smaller companies.17. Resumes get 8 secs of attention. Nobody will look at GitHubs. Nobody looks at cover letters. Hiring managers are short on time.",

I see this as an advantage given that this gives me a wide range of knowledge and perspective on things.

I have basic skills in CS at this point... tweaking HTML / CSS on personal websites, requesting and formatting data using Python, workable understanding of OOP ideas, etc. I've had my head buried in what the career path looks like for creative professionals for the last ten years, but over the last couple months I've been considering a switch to CS, especially software engineering. I've been networking at my current company which has a decent number of engineering positions, trying to do as much LinkedIn Learning and freeCodeCamp as I can in my free time, and trying to come up with as many little personal projects as I can to build up a portfolio of projects, and documenting anything I touch at work that could possibly relate to CS work in the future. I would love to be able to start applying for junior level software engineering roles in 1-2 years, and I know there's really no magic bullets, but is there anything I'm overlooking as far as areas I should be focusing on when building experience and knowledge?

Instead of wasting applicants' hours preparing and grinding through their OA tasks, only to reject us within a day of submission? Is this some kind of compliance test? If you want to filter people out, can't you just do it the easy way?I'm tempted to create an open-source list of trash companies that don't respect applicants' time. Likewise, I don't care how prestigious you are - you're a TRASH company to me if you show no respect for applicants' time.\\--- UpdateI might not have explained myself clearly and caused some confusion based on the comments I received. Think about two different recruiting workflows:1. AI screening -> manual screening -> applicant completes the OA -> interview process...2. Applicant completes the OA -> AI screening -> manual screening -> interview process...The second approach doesn't make any sense, unless the screening algorithm gives the OA result high weight/priority (even so you can still apply AI screening without OA before the OA). It's a huge waste of applicants' time as they could have been rejected in the first place instead of wasting huge amount of time and energy grinding down the OA tasks. However, AFAIK, it feels like a bunch of companies have implemented their workflow as #2. Why on earth is this? Feel free to correct me if my speculation is wrong.",

I kinda fell in love with this discipline since it blended technical expertise with human factors. It also seemed to be of very practical application as the projects always ended in some kind of testable prototype.However, I noticed it's probably the CS domain with fewer jobs, and the ones which exist, separate the \"computer\" skills from the \"human\" skills into different roles, killing what makes this specialization interesting in the first place. I also noticed it's not considered an attractive discipline amongst my CS peers.In your opinion, what makes HCI feel so 'singled out', as a CS field? And why does it fail to get market traction?",

I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.Maybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.So I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you?

It was a really stressful period during work. Up to that point I felt I was good. After that I felt I had a lot of flaws and was not good. Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.And right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).So I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...I am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.Lately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.I was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern). It looked like should not work. I wanted to discuss with another colleague... After 10min of the call, I spent another hour to debug the code and check how it functions via tests. It worked well. Messaged the MID dev and I felt I wasted his time.These questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...I just feel I do not get enough work done, I feel somewhat unmotivated and I feel I waste people's time...

Essentially he said I am slow and too dependent on others and they expect more of me each year and that my PR needed a lot of changes when reviewing them.Needles to say, the issues he presented are not frequent, they happened a few times but that's it so he picked those as examples.Why I am asking if this is stack ranking is because:1- The manager said he beleives i am between underacheived and acheived, he said i am in the upper echelon of under acheived and that I will not be PIPed, he said this coming fiscal year he will focus on me more to help me out2- he gave me a bonus and a raise slighlty less than what the acheived person gets.3- the company lost some 20 million dollars due to some fuck ups in the finance department, so everyone got a 20% cut from their bonusesOr maybe I just suck and am actually underachieved. I'm afraid to get fired before finding a new job especially that i suck at leetcode.",

The actual controls work was done by the HQ team, so my role was mostly testing, documentation, and managing processes. Not super exciting, but I had access to the software and documentation, I was doing some side projects about control systems.Three months ago, I made a move to a job that aligns both career prospect and enjoyment: computer vision for autonomous driving (both classic and machine learning-based). I was supposed to dive into data analysis, develop algorithms, and write C++ code, basically the kind of stuff I love.Fast forward, and my role has been completely flipped. Now I’m working in software integration, linker issues, process compliance stuff and requirements management. This feels like a giant detour from what I signed up for, and honestly, it’s making me angry. My manager even said it could be a nice career.Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you stick it out or bail? Is it worth grinding through a few more months in hopes of getting back to the “good stuff,” or should I just jump ship back to my old gig?I’m frustrated, confused, and could really use some advice from folks who’ve been there.Thank you.",

I’m trying to figure out what makes the most sense for my career long-term:* Should I return to the same FAANG for another internship?* Or should I branch out (another FAANG, startup, something in SF) to diversify my experience?My main concern is that if I don’t go back, I lose the direct hiring pipeline into this FAANG. If I do a return internship then securing a new grad role is going to be very easy. On the other hand, the role is in Toronto—so the pay is lower than US offices, and the local tech scene doesn’t compare to SF. Since I’m still early in my career, I want to maximize learning and growth.I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in a similar position: what did you choose, how did it impact your job search after graduation, and what would you recommend I do with this opportunity?Thanks in advance!",

I also checked the statistics for CS in California and I was met with a similar outlook despite everything online saying the market is oversaturated and to pivot while you still can. Is this just anecdotal vs statistical evidence or is there something of note there?It would suck to give up on CS as I genuinely enjoy it but would it be wise to pivot into something else while I still can? If so what would have good prospects? If I continue with CS how would I go about breaking into the industry with a seemingly disappearing entry point?

        "content": "It's been a few months since I graduated and it feels like my job prospects are sharply going down over time. Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.The projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any \"real\" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it \"right\" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)I just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).I don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’ve been working with a client for the past 7 years. The pay is decent and there used to be a fair amount of flexibility, but there’s always this constant rush to deploy things.Two years ago, two new devs joined the team. The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes “shortcuts” to speed up development. Usually they’re hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other’s toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people’s work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.On top of that, there’s never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or “needs to be deployed ASAP.” We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it’s not a toy project.My concern is that after 7 years, I don’t feel like I’ve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds. For context, I’m a full stack developer with 14 years' experience.Is this normal? Or am I just stuck in a dysfunctional setup that’s holding me back?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "tl;dr: [This](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) is the project. The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).I've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.So all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**A lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.The project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.The problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's \"in Japanese\" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.I am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about. I want a job, and I want to optimize my personal projects to help me get that job as much as I can. So I'd love some input on whether projects like the one I linked are good fits for that or if I need to shift gears and go another route. I'm totally happy either way, I just really want to know so I don't waste months of my time.",

Double down on my existing backend/dev skills – improve depth in Java/Spring Boot, testing, microservices, system design, cloud-native concepts, Kubernetes, DevOps pipelines, observability, and scaling distributed systems.Here’s my situation:* I’m not really interested in GenAI at the moment. It feels like a hype-driven bubble, and I don’t want to learn a stack just because it’s trendy.* My main focus has been building solid, scalable backend systems, and I enjoy working in that space.* I don’t mind picking up GenAI *if it becomes unavoidable in backend roles*, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin. To be clear:* I am not the type of person who chases the latest tech hype unless it directly benefits my day-to-day work.* Even though I am interested in GenAI personally, right now what I want to focus more on is being employable and relevant in the upcoming years as a Java backend developer.* I am also focusing on a specific side-hustle which I want to turn around into a full time business in the future, so I don't have the time to pursue/learn something new from the scratch unless it is absolutely necessary.My questions are:* Will I be missing out on backend job opportunities now (or in the next few years) if I don’t learn GenAI?* Is GenAI integration actually becoming a *must-have* skill for Java/Spring Boot developers, or is it still more of a niche?* From a long-term career perspective (5+ years), would I be better off becoming a stronger backend engineer with deep cloud/microservices/devops skills, or should I invest in GenAI sooner rather than later?* For those of you working in the industry — are companies actually *expecting* backend developers to know GenAI, or is it more of a nice-to-have skill for specific roles/domains?I’d love to hear from people in the industry (especially those hiring or working on enterprise systems). Is the future of backend development leaning toward “every backend dev should know AI/LLM integration,” or will strong fundamentals in backend + cloud still carry the most weight ?",

Sometimes deeming those non-urgent tasks as urgent.3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.5.

Has a very anxious/ chaotic vibe. Generally, he is hard to communicate with, or even get a clear idea of what he wants (or correct his unrealslistic expectation) at any given moment. He feels like a fly buzzing around my ears while I'm just trying to focus and get my work done. How would you handle/ work with this manager to get on his good side and do well in the company? I like everything else about my team, so unless he becomes and active danger to my career, switching teams isn't on the table.I think this is a good potential learning experience to learn how to deal with this type of person. What experiences have you had like this, and how did you handle them?",

        "content": "Several years ago, it seemed the mindset is they are only posting for the ideal candidate and you should apply anyway. Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. I know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, \"Do you know Spring Boot? Do you know Angular?\" Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it. So, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. A bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.I don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews. Does anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?",

Here's the jist of my resume.I'm 33. I have an undergraduate degree in neuroscience. During my undergrad Google opensourced tensorflow and I became really interested in AI and computer programing. I did an internship at a small mom and pop toy company where I got to play with 3d printers, laser cutters, and I lerned some embedded systems programing for the msp430 microcontroller.Out of college I worked in the scenic industry doing corporate art projects, museum exhibits, and themed entertainment. I started out as a carpenter, moved to being a CNC programer/operator, and then an electrician. By about 5 years in I was working on animatronics for clients like Disney and interactive experiences involving ardunio and raspberry pi.After some years of that I decided to hang up my shingle as an independent contractor. For a while, I still catered to the scenic and event industry, but I also started getting a lot of work doing proof of concept prototypes for product design and various other small tech projects. For the last 5 years 75% of my work has been doing custom electronics, and remote sensor management for a company that is mostly involved in emergency response. It involves a lot of DSP and computer vision. I like what I do a lot but the pay isn't that great, and it's very unstable due to the nature of grant funding.Skills: python, C/C++, linux, embedded linux, pytorch/tensorflow/openCV, solidworks, kicad, ansible, AWS, CI/CD.What should I be when I grow up? I'm looking for something chill, and WFH. I'm more interested in software than I am in hardware these days.",

I'm also pretty disorganized so I was going to respond, but the days passed by am I didn't. Now it's been 2 weeks and I basically ghosted him, not telling him I'm not interested (I wanted to interview anyway just to see if I could have the option, but I probably wouldn't take it because I got good feedback at work so my confidence in my company is renewed for now).I feel really bad!

        "content": "I’m a 2nd year undergrad student and i go to a community college and really just don’t know anything regarding career stuff, like everyone around me has been getting internships since high school and doing programs i’ve never even heard of. So anyways, I’m trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.Firstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I’ve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people’s resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that’s a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that’s something worth sharing or if maybe I’m just not ready yet to be applying to internships.Alright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I’ve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they’re not very relevant to cs so I don’t wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it’s worth adding? Lmk guys.Thirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help :slightly_frowning_face:.Ok thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",

I think i can make both look good on a resume but im stressed and terrified that im not going to be able to get a job.Ive been heavily burned out for the past few years, and i very mucy understand ive been dropping the ball on my career, but am trying to work my way through that and get back on the horse recently, im interested in backend swe or sdet roles but will take anything i can after graduation. Im working on a couple projects right now, doing a couple leetcode questions a week, taking an online course in selenium, and in once september starts i plan to apply to everything i can including both internships and full time roles.Cards on the table: im really scared ive messed up and now im not going to be able to get a job, what do yall think i should do to maximize my chances?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello everyone,I have 10 years of experience as an SWE (mostly .NET), and I've been through an anxiety train with some personal things and impostor syndrome.I was laid off in July and I currently have 2 offers in hand, and another 2 final interviews... so in a sense, im probably not in a that bad situation, 4 chances in 1 month is probably great.Reminder that I am based in Portugal so the salaries will just be lower. Regardless of that I feel like its a good idea to start working as soon as possible to not fill a gap.Offer 1: 70k in a USA International consulting agreement (4k net for 3 months, drops to 3k net in contract). This would be a B2B contract until the office gets setup here, which in their perspective takes 3 months. This would become a hybrid role 1x per week, but its 300km away. Besides, since its a B2B with absolutely no benefits (no insurance, no PTO, no nothing, just a monthly retainer), I would have to open tax activity and terminate my unemployment salary which I have for another 1.5 years (worth 1.3k month) and I will not get it back if they fire me (which they can for whatever reason since this is California based law with 0 rights for me). I feel this is extremely risky as they can just replace me with an offshore for cheap anytime they want, and the glassdoor reviews seem spammed with fake 5 stars, with 1 star comments actually mentioning the CEOs names.Offer 2: My ex ex company offered 2k net and its a 2x per week hybrid role, 70km away, which is better. They want me to be a tech lead and grab every backoffice and migrate to a modular monolith, with .NET and React. It is a long term contract, I have been in this company for 6 years and I needed 0 technical interviews to get an offer, just a call to my boss and he straight away gave me a contract and all his plans.I am thinking of accepting offer 2, even though its lower. My plan is to just have a safety zone and invest my free time: keep doing interviews and grind system design (which I now will in this job) and learn kubernetes.Am I doing the correct thing to play safe and secure, and jump back to something better if it shows up?",

The tasks are mainly developing ETL pipelines, data processing, and monitoring.I’m wondering how difficult it is to transition into another direction, for example into a Data Engineer role, if most of my professional experience is tied to such a niche technology? Has anyone here made a similar switch, and if so, what technologies would you recommend focusing on?*P.S.: This was actually my first job offer since the beginning of the year, and there aren’t really any other entry-level positions in my area, so quitting is not an option right now.*",

        "content": "Hi everyone,Recently I applied for an AI software engineer (basically MLE) position at an AI company in Germany, I had a screening interview with the HR which I think went reasonably well. However, this week I received an email saying that I won't be proceeding into the next stage due to the following reasons:- Role-specific experience- Seniority level- Industry-based experience (e.g AI or Machine learning but also start-up or scale-up)To provide more context, I recently graduated from the Master program in math at a German university. I obtained my BSc degree in math (with minor in CS) from an US university in 2020. Even though both programs are pure math, I still contributed to some open source projects, such as SageMath, and I know other languages than Python.*I am still job hunting for positions in other companies, but I was wondering how could I improve based on these feedback? Do you have any resource recommendations?*Many thanks!**Some books/courses that I am following**: fast.ai, \"Hands-on LLM\" book, Stanford CS 224N, CMU DL Systems, LLM Engineering Handbooks, \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\" (I know TF is outdated so I'll choose another book for PyTorch).",

        "content": "Hi everyone, hope you're having a great day. I won't dilly-dally too much and I'll try to get right to it:I've recently graduated from college with a BSc in Computer Science. For the past year (exactly 1 year next month) I've been working as Frontend Developer in a super small local company. It's been pretty good and I feel like I've learned a lot. Here's the company setup: my superior/boss is also the only backend developer here (I'm the only Frontend dev) so we work closely together. However, my workload is often determined by the superior's work done (since I can't really do much outside of bug-fixing and optimizations if there's no new features) and for this entire summer it's been close to none.This is nice in a sense that I can focus on my personal projects (which I am), but in the back of my mind I'm still worried that I'm stagnating commercially, and I think that especially in these early years of my professional experience I would greatly benefit from mentorship and I could learn a lot from other developers as well. Eventually I would like to climb the ranks etc which is simply not possible here where I currently am...What do you guys think? Start looking to join a big team/company to learn (working in teams, scrum, code-reviews etc) or stay here? Important to note (and a big worry for me), is the fact that my boss is expecting a baby very soon and I know that in that period I basically won't be doing anything again.Any and all input is appreciated, thank you guys!",

Also, if there are other technological fields in nature that cs can apply to that may also could be good fits.Georgia tech also offers a direct GIS masters program, so I was maybe thinking of doing surveying or some entry level GIS for a year and then applying for that if others have had experience getting a masters degree in this area.I can't be couped up in this office all day for the next 20 years.",
