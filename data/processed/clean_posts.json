        "content": "Hey folks,So here's the situation: one of our stakeholders got hyped up after reading some LinkedIn post claiming you can \"magically\" connect your data warehouse to ChatGPT and it’ll just answer business questions, write perfect SQL, and basically replace your analytics team overnight. No demo, just bold claims in a post.We tried to set realistic expectations and even did a demo to show how it actually works. Unsurprisingly, when you connect GenAI to tables without any context, metadata, or table descriptions, it spits out bad SQL, hallucinates, and confidently shows completely wrong data.And of course... drum roll... it’s our fault. Because apparently we “can’t do it like that guy on LinkedIn.”I’m not saying this stuff isn’t possible—it is—but it’s a project. There’s no magic switch. If you want good results, you need to describe your data, inject context, define business logic, set boundaries… not just connect and hope for miracles.How do you deal with this kind of crap? When influencers—who clearly don’t understand the tech deeply—start shaping stakeholder expectations more than the actual engineers and data people who’ve been doing this for years?Maybe I’m just pissed, but this hype wave is exhausting. It's making everything harder for those of us trying to do things right.",

The second job involved gathering business requirements and writing hundreds of SQL queries for a massive system implementation. So now, I’m trying to get an *actual* data engineering job, and in this market, I’m not having much luck. What can I do to beef up my CV?

All you need is one binary. After ingesting data via [sling](https://docs.slingdata.io), I found querying to be quite responsive (due to the SQL catalog backend). with Iceberg, querying can be quite sluggish, and you can't even query with SQL without some heavy engine like spark or trino.Of course, Iceberg has the advantage of being more established in the industry, with a longer track record, but I'm rooting for ducklake.

I'm not entry level to data I have experience just indirectly and with more basic tools like Excel and smaller datasets of thousands of rows. I'm shocked that companies think I'm so stupid I couldn't learn some new things in the first 3 months on a new job. If someone knows SQL and has the Snowpro Core certification + boot camp training they probably will be okay with Snowflake. But no, unless you superficially used Snowflake for a few years at your past job you're an idiot and can't be trusted. I'm getting rejected because I haven't used obscure and simple tools like AWS Glue. I don't know what I will do, I might be screwed. Even if there are entry level jobs open I'm sure they are quickly saturated with competition.

That seems...incredibly expensive.Or would they pre-aggregate at a higher granularity, potentially sacrificing some dimensions in the progress, to accelerate their dashboards?This way you could just group by hour + ad_id + dim1 + dim2 ... and then run sum(clicks) / sum(impressions) to get a CTR estimate.

        "content": "To provide measurable benchmarks, there is a need for standardized tasks and challenges that each participant can perform and solve. While these comparisons may not capture all differences, they offer a useful understanding of performance speed. For this purpose, Coiled / Dask have introduced a challenge where data warehouse engines can benchmark their reading and aggregation performance on a dataset of 1 trillion records. This dataset contains temperature measurement data spread across 100,000 files. The data size is around 2.4TB.**The challenge**“Your task is to use any tool(s) you’d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3: s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also generate the data yourself.”**The Result**The Apache Impala community was eager to participate in this challenge. For Impala, the code snippets required are quite straightforward — just a simple SQL query. Behind the scenes, all the parallelism is seamlessly managed by the Impala Query Coordinator and its Executors, allowing complex processes to happen effortlessly in a parallel way.**Article**https://itnext.io/the-one-trillion-row-challenge-with-apache-impala-aae1487ee451?source=friends_link&sk=eee9cc47880efa379eccb2fdacf57bb2**Resources**The query statements for generating the data and executing the challenge are available at https://github.com/boroknagyz/impala-1trc",

It doesnt matter if you know how to write a loop in some language or how to define a class or anything similar, you just need to be able to realize when you need to iterate over something or express a concept with specific attributes. You can always just reference the syntax later.I have taken soo many lessons on these things and they all make sense on that day but days later I forget what each of them mean. However, the concept of doing X in a certain way remains.Am I weird for being this way? I often feel discouraged when I have to look up a term that other people are using online. At work it happens a lot less with technical jargon as people often just say what they mean in such case BUT in exchange, there is a huge amount of corporate jargon that is used instead: I don't have the bandwidth to keep up with it all.",

This pipeline uses AI agents (orchestrated with LangChain/LangGraph and powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to:* **Plan** data transformation strategies.* **Generate** production-ready PySpark code.* **Review** the generated code for quality and correctness.* **Execute** transformations across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.* Crucially, **self-correct** by revising code and retrying in case of errors.It aims for a truly zero-touch, self-healing data flow, with integrated observability via LangSmith.As a CS undergrad, this is my first significant venture into building a comprehensive data transformation agent like this. I've learned a ton about integrating LLMs with data platforms.I'd be incredibly grateful if you seasoned data engineers could check it out. Any feedback on the architecture, agent design patterns, PySpark optimization, scalability considerations, or general best practices would be immensely valuable for me.**:open_book: Deep Dive (Article):** [https://medium.com/@codehimanshu24/revolutionizing-etl-an-agentic-medallion-data-pipeline-on-databricks-72d14a94e562](https://medium.com/@codehimanshu24/revolutionizing-etl-an-agentic-medallion-data-pipeline-on-databricks-72d14a94e562)",

I'm a cloud engineer working on AWS and GCP and I am looking for new techniques and new tools that would cut costs drastically.For the metrics, we have roughly 2TiB active storage, 25TiB of BigQuery daily analysis (honestly, this seems a lot to me) and 40GiB daily streaming insert. We use Airflow and Dagster to orchestrate the DataFlow and python pipelines.At this scale, it seems that the way to go is to switch to a lakehouse model with iceberg/Delta in GCS and process the data using DuckDB or Trino (one of the requirements is to keep using SQL for most of the data pipelines).From my researches :* DuckDB can be executed in-process but does not fully support Iceberg or Delta* Iceberg/Delta seems mandatory as it manages schema evolution, time travel and a data catalog for discovery* Trino must be deployed in a cluster and i would prefer avoid this unless if there are no other solutions* pyspark with SparkSQL seems to have cold start issues and is non trivial to configure.* Dremio fully supports iceberg and can be executed in K8S pods with the Airflow Kubernetes Operator* DuckLake is extremely recent and i fear this is not prod-readySo, my first thought is to use SQL pipelines with Dremio launched by Airflow/Dagster + Iceberg tables in GCS.What are your thoughts on this choice ?

        "content": "Hey everyone—I could really use some advice.I’m currently a senior data analyst working in healthcare fraud analytics and model development at a large government contracting firm. Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.Recently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.I already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.The catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.I expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.⸻My question for you all:1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)4. If I pass this up, how hard would it be to break into DE externally without prior experience or the DE title?Any perspective—especially from folks who’ve made the jump or hired junior/mid DEs—would really help. Thanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hopefully this is the correct subreddit. Not sure where else to ask. Premise: So our application has a requirement from the C-suite executives to be active-active. The goal for this discussion is to understand whether Mongo or Postgres makes the most sense to achieve that. Background: It is a containerized microservices application in EKS. Currently uses Oracle, which we’ve been asked to stop using due to license costs. Currently it’s single region but the requirement is to be multi region (US east and west) and support multi master DB.Details: Without revealing too much sensitive info, the application is essentially an order management system. Customer makes a purchase, we store the transaction information, which is also accessible to the customer if they wish to check it later. User base is 15 million registered users. DB currently had ~87TB worth of data. The schema looks like this. It’s very relational. It starts with the Order table which stores the transaction information (customer id, order id, date, payment info, etc). An Order can have one or many Items. Each Item has a Destination Address. Each Item also has a few more one-one and one-many relationships. My 2-cents are that switching to Postgres would be easier on the dev side (Oracle to PG isn’t too bad) but would require more effort on that DB side setting up pgactive, Citus, etc. And on the other hand switching to Mongo would be a pain on the dev side but easier on the DB side since the shading and replication feature pretty much come out the box. I’m not an experienced architect so any help, advice, guidance here would be very much appreciated.",

I was reflecting on what else my degree could be useful for, and I did a lot of data analytics and visualization, with a close friend of mine who was a math major just landing a very well paying Analytics job. This genuinely has me thinking of going back for MS in some data-related field.If you think this is a good idea, what programs/schools/masters do you recommend?

        "content": "I'm currently learning Python, specifically the Polars API and the interaction with SQLAlchemy. There are functions to read in and write data to a database (pl.read_databaae and pl.write_database). Now, I'm wondering if it's possible to further specify the import logic and if so, how would I do it?Specifically, I wan to perform an Upsert (insert or update) and as a table operation I want to define 'Create table if not exists'. There is another function 'pl.write_delta', in which it's possible via multiple parameters to define the exact import logic to Delta Lake:```.when_matched_update_all() \\.when_not_matched_insert_all() \\.execute()```I assume it wasn't possible to generically include these parameters in write_database because all RDBMS handle Upsets differently? ...So, what would be the recommended/best-practice way of upserting data to SQL Server? Can I do it with SQLAlchemy taking a Polars dataframe as an input?The complete data pipeline looks like this:- read in flat file (xlsx/CSV/JSON) with Polars- perform some data wrangling operations with Polars- upsert data to SQL Server (with table operation 'Create table if not exists')What I also found in a Stackoverflow post regarding Upserts with Polars:```df1 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"inner\") .select(df_new.columns) ) df2 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") ) df3 = ( df_old .join(df_new, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") ) df_all = pl.concat([df1, df2, df3])```Or with `pl.update()` I could perform an Upsert inside Polars:```df.update(new_df, left_on=[\"A\"], right_on=[\"C\"], how=\"full\")```With both options though, I would have to read in the respective table from the database first, perform the Upsert with Polars and then write the output to the database again. This feels like 'overkill' to me?...Anyways, thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!",

Databricks, with its unified platform for ETL, ML, and analytics on open formats, feels like a better long-term investment.That said, I don’t have a clear comparison on the cost structure, especially how Foundry stacks up against Databricks or Snowflake in terms of total cost of ownership or cost-performance ratio.If anyone has hands-on experience with all three, I’d really appreciate your perspective, especially on use case alignment, cost efficiency, and scaling.Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "I'm working on a project where I'm building a pipeline to organize, analyze, and visualize experimental data from different batches. The goal is to help my team more easily view and compare historical results through an interactive web app.Right now, all the experiment data is stored as CSVs in a shared data lake, which allows for access control, only authorized users can view the files. Initially, I thought it’d be better to load everything into a database like PostgreSQL, since structured querying feels cleaner and would make future analytics easier. So I tried adding a batch_id column to each dataset and uploading everything into Postgres to allow for querying and plotting via the web app. But since we don’t have a cloud SQL setup, and loading all the data into a local SQL instance for new user every time felt inefficient, I didn’t go with that approach.Then I discovered DuckDB, which seemed promising since it’s SQL-based and doesn’t require a server, and I could just keep a database file in the shared folder. But now I’m running into two issues: 1) Streamlit takes a while to connect to DuckDB every time, and 2) the upload/insert process is for some reason troublesome and need to take more time to maintain schema and structure etc.So now I’m stuck… in a case like this, is it even worth loading all the CSVs into a database at all? Should I stick with DuckDB/SQL? Or would it be simpler to just use pandas to scan the directory, match file names to the selected batch, and read in only what’s needed? If so, would there be any issues with doing analytics later on? Would love to hear from anyone who’s built a similar visualization pipeline — any advice or thoughts would be super appreciated!",

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL Debezium CDC connectors as of now. As per my understanding, the reason MongoDB and PostgreSQL connectors need the heartbeat mechanism is that both MongoDB and PostgreSQL notify the connector of the changes in the subscribed collections/tables (using MongoDB change streams and PostgreSQL publications) and if no changes happen in the collections/tables for a long time, the connector might not receive any activity corresponding to the subscribed collections/tables. In case of MongoDB, that might lead to losing the token and in case of PostgreSQL, it might lead to the replication slot getting bigger (if there are changes happening to other non-subscribed tables/databases in the cluster). Now, as far as I understand, MySQL Debezium connector (or any CDC connector) reads the binlog files, filters for the records pertaining to the subscribed table and writes those records to, say, Kafka. MySQL doesn't notify the client (in this case the connector) of changes to the subscribed tables. So the connector shouldn't need a heartbeat. Even if there's no activity in the table, the connector should still read the binlog files, find that there's no activity, write nothing to Kafka and commit till when it has read. Why is the heartbeat mechanism required for MySQL CDC connectors? I am sure there is a gap in my understanding of how MySQL CDC connectors work. It would be great if someone could point out what I am missing. Thanks for reading.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I was wondering where do you usually store static element that are often require to ingest or to filter in your different pipeline.Currently we use DBT seeds, for most of them, this remove static elements from our SQL files but CSV seeds are often not enough to represent the static element I require.For example, one of my third party vendors have an endpoint which return a bunch of data in a lot of different format, I would like to track a list of the format I’ve approved, validated, etc.The different type of data are generally handle by 2 elements. I would like to avoid having to define element1, subelement1, approved, format_xelement1, subelement2, approved, format_y.I currently can do this in seeds but what I would like is a kind of CRM that allow me to do relations. So if element1 is approve than that’s something, and I have somewhere else to store all approved subelement for this.Might be complicate to understand in simple words, but tldr how do you store static things that are required for your pipeline ? I want something else than juste a table in Postgres because I want non tech people to be able to add elementsWe currently use Salesforce for some stuff, but are going away from it so I try to find a simple solution which can work for DE and not necessary the company as a hole. Something simple nothing fancy is required.Thanks",

        "content": "Perhaps I am missing something conceptually, but Ducklake does not support Primary Key constraints.So if I:I have a simple table definition: CREATE TABLE ducklakeexample.demo ( \"Date\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, \"Id\" UUID, \"Title\" TEXT, \"Quantity\" INTEGER );Add a row into it: INSERT INTO ducklakeexample.demo (\"Date\",\"Id\",\"Title\", \"Quantity\") VALUES ('2025-07-01 13:44:58.11+00','f3c21234-8e2b-4e1d-b9d2-a11122334455','Some Name',150),Then want to add a new row and update the Quantity of the existing one, in the same task. INSERT INTO ducklakeexample.demo (\"Date\",\"Id\",\"Title\", \"Quantity\") VALUES -- New dummy row ('2025-07-02 09:00:00+00', 'abcd1234-5678-90ab-cdef-112233445566', 'Another Title', 75), -- Qty change for existing row ('2025-07-01 13:44:58.11+00','f3c21234-8e2b-4e1d-b9d2-a11122334455','Some Name',0); This creates a duplicate entry for the product, creating a ledger like structure. What I was expecting is to have a single Unique Id, update in place, then use Time Travel to toggle between versions. The only way I can do this, is check if the Id exists, and if it does do a simple Update statement, then have follow up query to do the insert of fresh rows. Which puts this on the Application code.Perhaps I am missing something conceptually with table formats/parquet files, or maybe Ducklake is missing key functionality (primary key constraints), I see Hudi has primary key support. I am leaning that I am the issue.... Any practical tips would be great!",

        "content": "Hey folks,We're currently planning to deploy an on-premise big data cluster using Kubernetes. Our core stack includes MinIO, Apache Spark, probably Trino, some Scheduler for backend/compute as well as Jupyter + some web based SQL UI as front ends.Here’s where I’m hitting a roadblock: table management, especially as we scale. We're expecting a ton of Delta tables, and I'm unsure how best to track where each table lives and whether it's in Hive, Delta, or Iceberg format.I was thinking of introducing Hive Metastore (HMS) as a central point of truth for all table definitions, so both analysts and data engineers can rely on it when interacting with Spark. But honestly, the HMS documentation feels pretty thin, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something—or maybe even looking at the wrong solution altogether.Questions for the community:- How do you manage table definitions and data location metadata in your stack?- If you’re using Hive Metastore, how do you handle IAM and access control?Would really appreciate your insights or battle-tested setups!",

        "author": "ves_el",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm an electrical engineer with a background in digital IC design, and I've been working on a side project that might interest folks here: a **modular, node-based signal processing app** aimed at engineers, researchers, and audio/digital signal enthusiasts.The idea grew out of a modeling challenge I faced while working on a **Sigma-Delta ADC simulation in Python**. Managing feedback loops and simulation steps became increasingly messy with traditional scripting approaches. That frustration sparked the idea: what if I had a visual, modular tool to build and simulate signal processing flows more intuitively?**The core idea:**The app is built around a visual, schematic-style interface – similar in feel to Simulink or LabVIEW – where you can:* **Input your Python code**, which is automatically transformed into processing nodes* **Drag and drop** processing nodes (filters, FFTs, math ops, custom scripts, etc.)* **Connect them** into signal flow graphs* **Visualize signals** with waveforms, spectrums, spectrograms, etc.I do have a rough **mockup of the app**, but it still needs a lot of love. Before I go further, I'd love to know if this idea resonates with you. Would a tool like this be useful in your workflow?**Example of what I meant:***example.py* def differentiator(input1: int, input2: int) -> int:   # ...   return out1 def integrator(input: int) -> int:   # ...   return out1 def comparator(input: int) -> int:   # ...   return out1 def decimator (input: int, fs: int) -> int:   # ...   return out1I import this file into my \"program\" (it's more of an CLI at this point) and get processing node for every function. Something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/VCtF0Bd). And than I can use this processing nodes in [schematics](https://imgur.com/a/x6QIQUM). Once a simulation is complete, you can \"probe\" any wire in the schematic to plot its signal on a graph (Like LTSPice).Let me know your thoughts — any feedback, suggestions, or dealbreaker features are super welcome!",

Is this feature rock-solid or brittle? Any unexpected limits?2. **Pivot + bookmark persistence** – Can an end-user create and save a custom pivot layout as a \"bookmark\" *inside the embed*, without having to go to the main QS console?3. **Exports** – We have a hard requirement for both **CSV** and native **.xlsx** exports directly from the embedded dashboard. Are there any hidden row caps or API throttles we should know about?4. **SPICE vs. Direct Query** – For a table of this size, does an hourly incremental SPICE refresh work reliably, or is it painful? Any horror stories about Direct Query queueing under heavy concurrent use?5. **Row-level security at scale** – What is the community's consensus or best practice? Should we use separate QuickSight namespaces per tenant, or a single namespace with a dynamic RLS rules table?Links, gotchas, or clever workarounds—all are welcome. We're a small data-eng crew and really appreciate you sharing your experience!Thank you very much for your time and expertise!",

However, once the call began, they asked me to share my screen and write a piece of code: print all the prime numbers up to 50 using a for loop.It sounded simple enough, something I should’ve been able to do effortlessly. But the moment I began typing, I blanked out. I couldn’t recall even the basic syntax of JavaScript or Python. I could hear their laughter in my own head, even though no one mocked me directly. It was deeply embarrassing.In that moment, I started questioning my skills and every decision that brought me here. I’ve built several projects, some quite complex, like an image size compressor but none of that mattered when I failed to write a basic loop. Maybe it was the nerves, or maybe I just froze under pressure. I’m not entirely sure.I don’t know if it’s appropriate to share this here, but I felt the need to. This experience shook me. I realize now that I need to revisit the basics, not out of shame, but because I owe it to myself to rebuild with confidence.",

It started with webapps, Django, REST apis, etcThen moved onto database info, postgres etc.Then moved onto frontend with React etc. I began to feel like things were slowly *snowballing* out of control, that i didn't really understand how to code anymore, and that i was relying too heavily on docs/stack overflow etc. everything felt like a hacky-system that i was just sticking together.So i decided to go back to Python basics and do an intermediate project that doesn't rely on any of that. A chess engine.Something i almost attempted before, but decided to do web apps instead. And i can't even begin to understand what to do. I spent hours researching, planning etc. And when looking things up, you have 2 extremes. 1. No answer to simple questions. 2. A direct answer giving you all the code. Now i decided that it wasn't really something i wanted to do. And decided to think of another project... but tbh i just want to quit at this point. I miss the days where i would just create classes/objects from scratch, my own decorators, functions, inheritance etc. When i actually *made* things. Yknow?Now everything is: \" slap this thing thats already created into another thing. Spend months learning a framework on specific functions, states, objects, that change more frequently than your underwear. To put something together in 2 lines that you don't quite understand! \"Does anyone else feel like this? Am i just going about everything wrong? Should i start a project from scratch that i just absolutely don't touch other frameworks/modules etc?Kinda stuck, lost, and demotivated.",

I’ve really just been getting into crochet to take off the pressure about contractual stuff and just focus on something else for the time being like making a sweater I saw from Pinterest for instance..I have about three projects which are unfinished and I promised myself especially about the portfolio website that I will finish it because I have been working on that since last December. Then again the reason why it took awhile was because of I was trying to figure out and decide what the UI would look just to avoid large frontend revisions. Anyways, any advice for managing projects?

Started with editing (see: copying code into and altering) a 3D character controller state machine for godot, was pretty proud that I got it so that the player couldn't uncrouch underneath something and adapted someone else's code to make a leaning system. Realized the 3D game idea was way way too outside of my skill set so I downgraded to 2D, worked on that a bit, got caught up making screenshot mockups cause I'm an artist, barely really coded anything but figured that this was still too hard for me probably. Tried making pong. Too hard. Finally I just ate my pride and said I'd shed the need of trying to learn to program and learn a game engine at the same time and now I'm making a text adventure game in python.The reason I had my first win is cause I've had such a hard time coding anything by myself. I've always needed a tutorial and never come up with solutions on my own. I needed a bit of help to get this project rolling but overall but now I'm able to open up VS Code and work alone with googling and documentation reading. I made a really basic save system on my own! Came up with the problem, thought about it, and came to a solution on my own! It's far from robust or complex, there are probably a million better ways to do this but I did it by myself and I'd say it's reasonably complex considering I was having troubles coding a 2D character controller on my own.I've got a long way to go but I think this is a good ass win.

Would anyone be able to quickly cover the types of concurrency and explain the differences (the main ones I can think of are multiprocessing, multiprogramming, multithreading, parallel processing)? Even just linking references would be nice (and yes, I could read and compare all their wiki pages, but I don't have the brainpower after a long day of work :/Thanks!",

Sometimes older Medical officer (MO) return out of no where. And They do not point out what the problem with me is, like is it a knowledge issue, skill issue. There are hopes of me getting my 1st job , but again they keep delaying.Out of frustration, I did some research on who has it easier time getting employed. And the more I look at it, the more it seems that programmers have much easier time getting hired. Hospitals are limited, slots are limited. But programming jobs , despite easy entry , seem much more flexible and elastic.And I used to dismiss it thinking all these programming courses are free and all. So I was thinking, as I stay unemployed, meanwhile why not learn programming as a side job while I keep applying for a medical job. I am posting this for 2nd opinion,",

        "content": "*Im writing this as an all encompassing Praise / Gripe / Warning for others considering the appeal of using* [*Boot.dev*](http://Boot.dev) *to learn about backend dev.*>**THE PRAISE**For learning actual code basics, ie Python / CLI / git, its been fantastic and well worth the money. The courses are very well put together and really make it easy and approachable to pick up and learn the foundational material. The community is exceptionally helpful, the AI tool for education theyve employed is very good at \"teaching\" you concepts without just flat providing the answers (very different from what the other AIs out there do), and you do feel as though you are progressing and learning as you go up in the subject matter.>**THE GRIPE** *i say this as someone who did NOT have a coding background*As you move along through the courses, especially once you hit the PyGame / Object Oriented Programming / Functional Programming areas, you will start to hit \"concept walls\" where you can't complete the answer just based on the information that's been previously provided. I've hit many moments, where feeling completely stumped on a lesson, that the core solve for it came from an understanding that was not reviewed in the previous \"internal\" materials, but existed as something that would have been \"understood\" if the user had some comp sci / programming background. It's just very frustrating at times to feel as though you've been paying attention to the materials and following along, only to suddenly hit a wall of knowledge and discover, \\[ no its designed to not be informed, so you have an urge to go out and find what you dont know \\]. Personally, if I'm paying for a service, I want the knowledge to be provided for learning, not that I have to go out externally elsewhere and hopefully discover it. >**THE WARNING**Content will become SIGNIFICANTLY harder as you progress. The Discord is there and does help a lot in answer basic questions, and some more advanced ones; but it does genuinely feel as though the course materials are being written more for people who are already have familiarity with Comp Sci / Programming, **ie the core basics**, and then the later courses are meant to build on top of that wider external schooling and knowledge. Those that are there to assist, again all well meaning and wanting to be helpful, advise on how to solve for it as if they were speaking to other programmers who also are familiar with the code youre having trouble with. Like hearing 2 experts talk to each other trying to solve a problem, if youre not on the same level knowledge wise, it becomes more difficult to follow along on what theyre trying to advise on how to correct for. >**FINAL THOUGHTS**The service provided is INCREDIBLY well worth the cost... to a point depending on where you're starting from. If you have some code formal training / teaching, it probably is easier to follow along, but its openly stated that there is a teaching approach of not providing all the resources / guideposts for you to follow, and that you should go beyond the platform to find some answers.**For me, I have issue with that approach as a service I'm paying for to learn a subject matter on** *but again, thats uniquely to me*I just want to share this to both promote the service, as I have been able to write functional python blurbs for solving my own small scale ideas and puzzles; but also as a warning that its VERY unlikely you can go into this, completely cold fresh and blind, and come out within 1 year as a trained backend dev with the full experience. I'll most likely renew my yearly membership for the platform, but there are hurdles that I now have to figure out the best way to learn-around instead of just beating my face into the wall as I have been for some problems.",

So, I want to ask, is it really?Python does look easy, but the indentation makes no sense to me and it honestly makes code more difficult to follow for me. I have no experience in Python so I may be VERY wrong. But personally, even though I can understand Python code to a good extent, the indentation just throws me off and makes reading nested code a HEADACHE for me because I have to take a hot second on each line to see where the indentation begins and ends. Now, this could all be because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but isn't the whole point of Python to be easy to read and understand? It is easy to read, I understand most code snippets out there, but the whole indentation thing is just so confusing to me. Is this a normal thing to say? Am I going crazy for questioning Python's readability? I'll still learn it some day, but I just wanted to ask whether anybody has ever felt this way and how they overcame it, because I don't want to get a headache every time I create an API.",

That's (more or less) why we have the very popular rule of thumb in Python: multithreading for I/O-bound work, multiprocessing for CPU-bound work.Also thank you to u/HQMorganstern for the more detailed explanation",

I'm currently 10 years in as a Jorneyman electrician but my body is unfortunately breaking down.I know i'm a little old to be changing directions but my GF (soon to be fiance.... Hopefully) has been pushing me to go towards a career i've always had dabbled with in my free time.I'm just in need for some advice on my best route possible. I've played around with TrueNAS, linux, and Docker before and i am well aware that these are just trivial things and in no way a reflection as to how difficult coding truly is.What i'd like to ask the community is: What is some advice anyone in the industry could lend me? Should I go to uni and take night classes? Would online certificates land me a good job? If so where should i take them?I've also been very interested in [Boot.Dev](http://Boot.Dev) Has anyone been able to land a job with the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) program? if not and i were to sign up for their program, would i be wasting my money by signing up for another online school to pass their accredited courses?The reason i'm so interested in [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) is i have ADHD and i never knew about it until my 4th year of trade school. I always had issues with learning by reading. but with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) making it into a game i truly think i could pick up the basics through them.Anyways, I apologized for ranting. if anyone could lend this old man some knowledge i would be forever indebted!Thanks!!",

I used to look forward to every upload, it felt like a little event each time. Watching the channel grow over the years and gain millions of subscribers has been awesome.Lately though, I’ve noticed that most of the content has been focused on AI, especially in the Code Report series. I totally understand why AI is huge right now, and those videos are pulling crazy numbers. But I kind of miss his older content, like the classic “100 Seconds of (Tech)” videos, the JavaScript survival guide, or Web Dev 101. That kind of content was gold, especially for new and intermediate devs or engineers trying to get a solid grip on different technologies quickly.It does seem like Fireship is aware of this he even mentioned in the recent MCP tutorial video that it’s still a tutorial channel. So it’s nice to see that acknowledgment. And to be fair, even his newer videos still have that signature humor and creativity that made his channel stand out in the first place.Overall, I still really enjoy his channel and respect what he’s doing. It’s been a valuable resource for a lot of programmers, developers, engineers. Fireship has played a big role in making learning tech feel less intimidating and more fun, and that’s something I’ll always appreciate.",

It’s very hard not to let this obstacle convince me that coding is just not for me, but I can’t deny how this brain fog makes it extremely hard to focus and have mental clarity. As a side note, I’m also navigating a difficult situation in life and it’s bringing a lot of stress and frustration. Has anyone ever dealt with that? Any advice? How not to let this issue discourage you from continuing to learn… I’ve got a personal project I really want to work on, and the last thing I want to hear is that I won’t be able to make it :pensive_face:",

I used AI to help generate and structure some of the flashcards, but I made sure to review and refine everything by hand so it’s actually useful and not just noisy.There’s also a blog section — I’ll be honest, part of the reason I added it was to help grow the site a bit and make it more friendly for things like AdSense. But I’ve tried to make sure the posts are genuinely helpful, not just filler.Anyway, it’s still a work in progress, but if you give it a try I’d love to know what you think or what’s missing. Happy to improve it based on real feedback.It's available in both polish and english, however as most programming is done in english -> even for polish native I suggest you to use english version.Thanks!",

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice? Anybody who is/was in a similar situation who wants to share?",

The last option is an intro to computer programming class that I would prefer to take, but it doesn’t fit into my schedule. The professors for options 2 and 3 have horrible ratings (~1.8 on RMP) but they are the only options I can take. I have no experience in python and I am quite bad at math so I’m kind of stuck. I am currently enrolled in option 2 but I know it is going to be a struggle. I’m wondering if I should try to teach myself python basics before I get to school so I have a chance at passing (reviews mentioned the level of coding involved is not actually appropriate for an intro level class, and only students with previous experience were able to do well) or see if I can ask an advisor about finding an approved alternative course. Luckily my dad knows python so I can ask him for help on assignments and stuff so I won’t be completely lost if this class is my only option. What should I do?

        "content": "For a C++ project that I'm working on I intend to have a lot of data saved into a binary file. The program would also read the file and even re-write it, and the data would be ordered by the time when it was calculated.As I believe to understand, fstream read functions don't load the whole file into the ram, but if I want to remove parts and move everything back to \"fill in\" the space, it could lead to having to move very large amounts of data. With separated files, that work would be reduced, specially if I put a header in the files that tells the \"Creation time\" of the data inside, allowing the program to quickly detect the file in which the data that it's looking for is stored.My question is, at which size does it tend to be better to create a new file for the program to access? Would this even be the best way to implement what i want?Thank you",

Here’s my story.* When I started preparing for DSA and coding interviews, I thought I was being smart by exploring all possible resources.* I went down the rabbit hole,  watched one YouTuber’s playlist, switched to another when I didn’t feel productive, jumped from LeetCode to Codeforces to GFG and back. I even spent days reading Reddit threads and Quora answers trying to “find the best roadmap.”* Guess what? I wasted 3 full months doing just this. Minimal progress. Constant overwhelm. I wasn’t practicing,  I was just researching how to practice.* It hit me hard when my senior told me: The best resource is the one you actually stick to.* That’s when things changed. I picked one creator whose teaching style I liked. I stopped second-guessing and stuck to their roadmap. Within weeks, I saw more clarity and growth than I had in the past few months.* Here’s what I learned: You don’t need 10 resources. Give yourself 1-2 days max to pick a creator/platform. Then stop looking. Start solving. That’s where the growth is.* Don’t fall into the trap that the next video or roadmap will finally unlock it. Progress doesn’t come from finding the perfect guide, it comes from showing up and putting in the reps.If you’re just starting out, learn from my mistakes. Pick one solid resource. Trust it. Stick with it for at least a few weeks. You’ll thank yourself later.",

Something similar and simple like JS but are more strict and complex while also having many different techniques to solving problems, like how C# digs deeper into OOP, and Go is great for concurrency and I feel like those are tools that will really help level up my thinking and programming while also giving me the ability to build more complex applications.So, I don't know what's best. Getting stuff done fast, or leveling up the way I think and build programs? Maybe there is a middle ground?",

Now a days every role seems like unstable, roles are getting merged or eliminated, you cannot plan your career anymore. You cannot decide if I do X, Y, Z there is a high probability I will land P, Q or R. By the time you graduate P, Q, R roles may not even exist in the same shape anymore. You are trying to catch a moving target, it is super frustrating.Not only that you cannot build specialized expertise in a technology, it may get automated or outsourced or replaced by a newer technology.

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Let me start by saying I’m (early career) a year into this corporate job at a \"billion-dollar\" multinational company. I fully understand that any work I do while employed is legally the company's intellectual property. That said, this post is more about how I can take advantage of my contributions for my career rather than being brushed aside.A couple of weeks ago, I made an earlier post about a similar situation, but at a smaller scale. Since then, things have escalated quickly, and I feel the new developments warrant a separate post.Long story short, I modernized an outdated system with great success for our region. It gained a lot of traction so much so that a team from another region requested I build the same system for them, tailored to their needs.Now here’s where the new developments start. Apparently, while all this was happening, someone higher up at the global level got access to my project and showed it to their boss who is just one level below the CEO. I still have no idea who this person is or how they even gained access to my work. Anyways, this corporate leader was so impressed that they decided the system should be rolled out globally as soon as possible. The person who shared my project then took it upon themselves to assign a team dedicated to replicating it for all regions.Now this assigned team somehow managed to access my project (I genuinely suspect a security breach or admin-level involvement) and tried to reverse-engineer everything I built.. but failed. They then began trying to identify who was behind the project and eventually contacted my manager (the \"official\" project manager) by pulling him into a meeting without prior notice. Odd.So my manager then decided to setup a proper call with this team with me involved this time. In this call, they basically came forward and requested us to provide all the code, tools, and infrastructure so they can simply copy and paste it for all regions, as well as requesting several technical sessions. To make matters worse, they want me to handle all the IT bureaucratic processes for every region to get things set up. I can already see myself being roped into supporting all regions and not just my own at this point. Not only that, but I believe this \"replication\" approach will be destined to fail as each region has different user requirements and processes not quite comparable to ours. And I also strongly believe they will struggle to get anything running, due to their limited technical and business knowledge of the processes, and the type of technical questions I was being asked. Nevertheless, if this team rolls out my solution globally for each region, they’ll receive all the visibility and credit (they'll be hosting demo sessions with region leaders which for sure I wont be invited to), while I'll be essentially cast into the shadows. What’s frustrating is that I have full knowledge of the system and am responsible for it so why isn't my manager at least being the one leading this global rollout and not some random team?I’ve been trying to indirectly nudge my manager to take ownership of the global initiative, instead of letting this new team take over. But I’m not sure how this will play out. The person who assigned this team is closer to the corporate leader, while my manager is a few steps lower in the hierarchy. So far, all he’s done is try to keep our regional manager informed of the situation playing out. Realistically, only the regional manager can mention this to the corporate leader, but I’m not confident that will happen.My manager often says \"how will this benefit the team?\" But in this case, it’s clear he’s struggling to see any benefit in simply handing over our work to another team that will walk away with all the credit.We’re still in the early stages, and I haven’t handed anything over yet. But I’m deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. From a career perspective, it looks like I'm gaining nothing from this besides telling myself I did the work. Being so early in my career, a project like this would really benefit me tenfold. I really don't want to waste this chance to turn this into something beneficial.&nbsp;EDIT: Thank you to everyone who shared their perspective. I recognize that my tone reflected more negativity than I aim to carry as a person. I allowed ego to slip in due to the project's success. Moving forward, I’ll focus on assuming positive intent and professionally advocating for myself when possible as that is the only thing I truly have control over.",

When I look at the tech, yes it’s a tool that boosts productivity, but there’s so many limitations right now and so many issues that need to be address to reduce those limitations, that I think there will be some leveling off of this AI revolution.",

Especially because the job was in-person and paid something like 50k, which is not much for Boston.I work in economics, so I'm curious to see if this experience is representative of the field overall right now and what that might signal for the trajectory of the economy. From browsing this subreddit, it does seem like there's a lot of lamenting the state of the job market, but I'd be curious to hear insiders' perspectives.For anyone involved in hiring, are you seeing similar levels of competition? If so, is this a recent occurrence or has it been ongoing for a while? Is the current hiring environment similar to previous periods you've experienced (the Dot-com bubble, the GFC, etc.)?",

        "content": "~4 YOE. Took up a new job for a new change of pace. I did screw myself because this new role wasn't paying that much more than my previous role and the commute was significantly worse, but I was already sort of burned out by my old place so I thought anything would be a nice change of pace.Fast forward one and half weeks in. A few things struck to me as red flags -* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.There might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.After spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.I was given a warning for using my phone for \"non-productive reasons\" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours. This was followed by another warning from another member of management. Essentially two people. (With heavy irony that the person giving me the warning was also on his phone in between waiting for things to load.)Followed by a e-mail where the entire team was CC'ed, singling me out that I did not fall into their expectations for focus and productivity with possible escalation to the CEO.Consider this a vent or a plead for affirmation, but was it just me or did this behaviour come across as total overreach? Either way, I've decided that my way of working is clearly not aligned with the company's expectations and I immediately resigned on the spot. Yes, I know that the market is bad and this may have been an overreaction on my part, but would anyone of you have done the same?",

After about 6–9 years in this role, is there really anywhere to go?Let’s be real — it’s a simple job. You build screens, hook up APIs, and maybe add some animations or state handling here and there. But when it comes to core business logic, anything that actually requires deeper system thinking or architectural decisions — all of that is almost always at the backend (for good reasons).And honestly, most app devs I’ve worked with don’t even try to go beyond that. Very little interest in performance optimization, state management patterns, or even understanding what happens behind the API. It’s mostly a UI plumbing job.So I’m wondering — is this it? Do people just keep doing the same thing for 10–15 years until they’re replaced by younger devs who can do the same job for cheaper? Or is there a natural transition path (into BE, product, or something else) that actually makes sense?Would love to hear from others who’ve been in the app dev track longer or made a pivot.",

No layoffs but there’s been some people singled out and fired, and a ton of churn. I suspect a lot of problems here are happening in the industry as a whole. For product and eng it’s 100% driven by low engagement and burnout. I only started here in August but it’s been a straight trend of just doing everything wrong. New product leader came in around when I did. Slowly ripped away any authority that ICs/managers have to define their scope or what to prioritize. It’s extremely top-down, do whatever the cofounders want now, and that was fairly insulated when I started. They’ve pushed out any and all leadership that were a source of any friction at the top, and I think they saw this new leader they hired was gonna validate anything they say. Now it’s only yes-people in the room. Teams and reorgs constantly happen at whims of leadership without really consulting anyone. This then impacts roadmap items but the expectations don’t change. Roadmap itself is never even really committed too, cause they change priorities there all the time, you never know when or why the thing you were working on for three weeks will get deprioritized. You also don’t know when something you thought you’d do a month later you’re now expected to present a prototype of at the end of the week. A lot of expected overtime work, not a lot of pay or advancement opportunity. Definitely a lack of clarity or support on directions given. I’ve seen people ask valid questions get put on PIPs basically. As a designer I can definitely say this is not a place I expect to do great work or anything I can really showcase. The top down mandate is quite simply, AI-wash the product. I worked on a project with that mandate, just impossible constraints and no scope clarity. So I had to challenge that team to really turn this into something that customers would value and pay for and set a small target. With the full support and backing of my manager we really pushed to make sure it’s at least providing real value to the user, compromised as quickly as possible when necessary to unblock Eng (we were all building the plane while flying it). We really inserted ourselves so that we don’t make terrible UX decisions even and especially when that made things a little harder. Worked really hard on it, set a bar for quality. Executives swooped in last two weeks before launch and started asking for tons of changes, same timeline. So, lost time QAing there that really would have made a difference. Delayed the launch. They freaked out and blamed everyone they were pushing to work 80 hour weeks for a month to get this done. An eng quit on the spot which I applaud. Sure enough it launched and immediately sold enough to make the company profitable for its first quarter in like two years. Did we get any additional respect or acknowledgement, maybe some trust and respect for our process? lol. Well, that product leader got all the credit somehow despite having very little involvement. They got a promotion, and my manager, the one really backing me up challenging them and the team, got demoted, so no design voice in the leadership room now. This is the same product leader who’s entire staff either quit or been let go since they joined, and a replacement hired for most of them. Despised by everyone in product, design, and eng now. Yet, great at rubbing shoulders with management and pleasing them. Way too small of a company for politics like that to really work, but sure enough they convinced founders that they’re the goat. They have multiple engagement surveys where we’ve basically flatlined to zero on product side since that leader started. Feedback has been given calling out leadership as the source. None of the driving behavior changed or was addressed by them, it only got worse. Then Eng started to feel the impact of this over the last 6 months. A lot of them started quitting, the best ones that had been there longest and had most domain knowledge. most recent engagement shows a big dip for them now too. Def cannot replace them faster than they quit right now and it’s an existential risk. It’s looking like the ship is gonna sink itself here. I’m also just wondering if there’s greener grass or is this just how the industry is gonna be for a while? Business idiots running everything into the ground with zero accountability, and ICs treated like disposable resources who can be replaced by AI if they go. It’s frustrating cause if they actually empowered us a bit more, we have the talent and means of making a great product that actually sells, but it’s like their own egos take priority and they can’t conceive of anyone knowing the business opportunities worth investing in other than themselves. Down to the micromanaged details, like they don’t trust or value the expertise they hired.",

The question was something I hadn't seen at work or in common prep resources like Alex Xu or Hello Interview—likely a real internal component. I was completely stuck.How can I get better at designing systems I haven’t seen before? I feel like I’m memorizing patterns rather than building real intuition, especially since I don’t work at a big tech company.I’m thinking of:1. Re-reading DDIA more deeply2. Studying system whitepapers (Cassandra, DynamoDB, etc.)3. Reading more engineering blogsAny other suggestions?",

Technically, I’ve been eligible to graduate for the past year, but I’ve been deliberately delaying it to continue doing internships and gain experience while at the same time applying for full-time jobs. My plan was always to hit the graduation button the moment something landed.So far, I’ve racked up **28 months of internship experience**, mostly including software and hardware development at places like Dell Technologies and a space agency. And yet, I’m still struggling to land a full-time role, let alone an interview.The job market here in Vancouver (and across Canada) has been... bleak. I’ll admit I’ve been picky, wanting to stay in here, but it's been *REALLY* tough. I’m feeling incredibly stuck and unsure of how to move forward.I have some options that I'm considering, but I just don't know which move is best1. Delay graduation again to do an Undergraduate Thesis in Robotics, hopefully to fluff my GPA a bit and make me more competitive for grad school. Problem is, though I have considered a master's program, I don't even know what I'd want that to be in.2. Graduate in August and spend day and *night* applying for jobs. Figure out a grad school to go to later and hope my CV is good enough to get in. Maybe do an accounting diploma in the evenings as a back-up (I've heard the memes, I did have a friend successfully land a job after a year of their diploma though)3. Go into Electrical trades (my friend spent 8 months looking for work and started doing this when he couldn't find anything).4. Join the Air ForceFor those in similar shoes, what did you do? Would love to hear if anyone’s been in a similar situation or has insight from the other side.",

        "content": "**Overview**About 7 months ago, I got a job as a software engineer at a great company straight out of college. For the most part, I like my job. I really can't complain, but I just wanted to get other people's perspective. **Context**I went to school for programming because I loved it. My passion was mainly in embedded systems. During college, I was lucky enough to get a position as a research engineer on a research program, and got to write the firmware for a very small satellite. I truly loved it. During this period, I submitted hundreds of job applications that went nowhere. I ended up getting my current job from a connection I made during college.Don't get me wrong, I like my current job. I am not complaining in the slightest, I fully understand how lucky and privileged I am to be in my current position, and I don't take that for granted. I went through the job struggle like many others have. I even followed this sub, and almost lost hope because of it :( **Question**In my current position, I write Python microservices for a very large company. It can be interesting. Most importantly though, I couldn't be happier with my coworkers. They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them. However, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. That being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore. **Conclusion**Again, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want* to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week. **TLDR**Got a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad. What do other SWE's do about this?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Intro.**I wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.**Story time.**At first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.Over the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.After five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.I feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.**Where I applied.**About 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.**The numbers.**Now for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).**Advice.**Over the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a \"Skills\" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.Don't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.I spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",

Had that canon event we all seem to be going through of not being able to find anything.Fast forward 8 months post-grad, I cave and take a QA Engineer position. My thinking was that I'd take the route of automating everything I can to impress the devs and join them at the company, but no such luck. My company is mostly foreign, with about 70% of the staff being Chinese... including the entirety of the devs. I don't speak Chinese, and there's a blatant opportunity/ compensation bias towards my Chinese coworkers. Nonetheless, I get a few Automation certs, make a couple projects specifically for the company's benefit with the previous stack, and it gets me nowhere. A \"Thank you! Now get back to work\", and a 2% annual bump in my salary. So, while still trying to create applications/software to benefit my company, my main work has been devolved into manual testing. I'm desperately doing anything I can to code. But I feel like I've got the QA brand on me now after this long.Then I get home, see 3-5 more rejections from the prior days applications, apply to 15-20 more, leetcode, work on projects/ certs, go to the gym and lift out my frustration, and go to bed. It's been like this for **2 and a half years** now, and I'm losing my mind. I spend most of my days feeling like an absolute failure, and hating myself over this, and it's effecting my relationships because people are picking up on it now. I see friends/ acquaintances of the same age buying homes, having kids etc., that went right into the trades after high school. And I'm still living at my parent's place. I just feel so incredibly cheated and disheartened that those 4 years in college and countless post-midnight study grind sessions, along with all of the extra effort post-grad haven't gotten me anywhere.I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a CEO. I'm not applying to FANG or anything like that. Just all normal, average companies. I don't care to be wildly rich. I just want to be able to comfortably support a future family, and buy a house for them, and live out the American Dream. That's literally it, and I spend so much time being bitter about that being so far away right now. I'm just so tired of hating myself and feeling like a failure. It shouldn't be like this.",

Before this, I was working as a Full Stack Developer for the last 4 years at a very small company. The typical task at my last job was very simple CRUD work with business logic sprinkled in and our whole system ran fine on a medium EC2 instance. Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.While I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.We have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).What sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it? I feel like the last 4 years I've been playing little league and have only had to worry about such small things and picked up some bad habits, but now I'm in the big leagues and I feel so out of place.Thanks!",

I mainly wrote it for myself because I absolutely despise repetitive work, but word got around when I showed it to ONE person and I was persuaded to turn it into a standalone GUI tool. Eventually that task I entirely automated wasn't my responsibility anymore as I got a promotion and went to work on other projects. The individuals that wound up handling that task/responsibility heavily used my tool until it didn't work anymore because the structure of the source data changed, and the way the tool was written wasn't dynamic. So of course, they reach out to me to update it. I didn't really have time to update that thing, but they'd become so spoiled, I said okay. So I rewrote it. I implemented some pretty rudimentary data structures so it was dynamic and would work with any modifications to the source data. I also implemented some fuzzy matching so it would populate accurately regardless, whether there were differences in case or trailing spaces or whatever. One of the guys in the role decided to ask me for a walk through, because apparently, he has a CS degree. He looked through the code of the older version (static/hard coded) and the new version (dynamic/fuzzy) and said he didn't understand the updates --so he was going to work with the first one. Fast forward to yesterday and he's giving a \"demo\" on his \"updates\". On that call were members of management, eagerly anticipating something inventive and/or innovative from some supposed collaborative effort. I join the call late because I was super busy, but when I get on, he's walking through the logic, workflow, and data structures that I wrote in the first and second version. I'm sitting there like.. hmm.. this sounds like all of the functionality I built, and I'm wondering if I should air him out and let the entire group know. Of course I didn't because I'm better than that, but I did ask what improvements or updates he made (that constituted the meeting). The only thing he changed was swapping out one Excel read/write library for another, because the one I used (xlswriter) overwrites formulas in cells. Anyway, so while the tool isn't all that much of a big deal, because, I pretty much hacked it together in a couple of hours altogether to save myself some time, I can't help feeling a little petty about this dude passing along my work as his own. It's one thing to show the tool's usage, it's another to walk through the logic to upper-management, like he wrote the damn thing. AITA for even caring at all?",

I originally took the job because I was told I’d be doing development, but so far I’ve only done one project that sends out an email to my coworkers.I also hate my job and the people I work with. Every day feels like it could be my last. I’m surrounded by unrealistic expectations, humiliation rituals, and egos that don’t listen to reason. I’m coming up with a plan to leave because I don’t see how this job is helping my career as a software dev. To make things worse, I’ve become rusty because I haven’t coded in about a year.Here’s my plan for the next 3–6 months to get back on track and be as employable as possible:* Grind LeetCode’s **Blind 75**, with extra focus on arrays* Use ChatGPT to simulate behavioral interviews* Read and take notes on **Cracking the Coding Interview*** Clean up my GitHub and add projects + Blind 75 solutionsI also want to show some solid projects on GitHub to prove I know how to code. Any suggestions for projects that would stand out to employers?I’ve already started applying to jobs in hopes I find something marginally better, even while I’m rusty. I’m totally fine working in IT too — I just really want a remote job.Does this seem like a good plan? Any resources or changes that would be a better use of my time?",

It lasted from November 2023 to November 2024.I feel so lost. I really like coding and stuff but I have some issues:I suck with coming up with ideas for projects. I finally made one prototype app that uses sleepers api for fantasy football. It was built in python django since that is what my internship used, but remaking it in Java/Springboot since I prefer Java (https://mysleeperapi.com/). I also deployed it on my own too. It's not much, but it's kinda cool.Right now I have low motivation due to serious depression, and it's getting worse. I sit infront of my PC all day when not at my crappy data entry job.

        "content": "I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.Within a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.After leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.I interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with \"Strong Hire\" and “Hire” ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a \"No Hire\" for the technical part and rated \"Hire\" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.After this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development. Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.I've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.After these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.Now, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as \"Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)\" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I’m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.To anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?TL;DR2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance). Interviewed at 50+ top firms cleared 5, ghosted by 4, lowballed by 1. Took a break after a high-pay freelance gig; now out of work and savings running low. Built solid MERN stack projects.

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for people who might have gone through what I’m going through right now, and how they overcame it. I recently graduated college so I haven’t seen most of the world as of yet. I’m a Junior dev right now. 2 years of experience - this is the first and only place I’ve worked at. And it’s the only team I’ve worked with. I joined here straight out of college. Lately l have begun realizing just how emotionally invested I’ve become in this workplace. I’m so scared that this attachment will cause me to harm my own career as I would be resistant to switching jobs in the future, if I don’t fix this. First off, I have the best manager ever. Obviously I don’t have any reference points, as this is my first manager, but hearing stories from my friends - I consider myself to be pretty lucky. My manager is always pushing me to be the best, other senior leadership has told me that my manager talks very good about me to them, she is always available to explain things and is stern when I make mistakes. I’ve never been pinpointed or blamed for when Prod issues have happened, just reminded that these are very important incidents to learn from. I work in a finance heavy industry, so I had to learn A LOT about finance, and she taught me all of it. Second, my team is flexible. We aren’t expected to log in early if the need isn’t there. My manager is also fine with me taking multiple consecutive days off together if need be. We aren’t too personal with each other and I like the boundaries that everyone maintains. The work itself - it’s not tooooo interesting. I do work in finance, so it’s hard for me to accept what I’m doing actually matters. It feels like a zero sum game to me. The problems we solve with engineering have more to do with reducing the manual work for finance bros. So I always feel like I’m working underneath them as opposed to with them. The work hours can also stretch to 9/10 hours a day, sometimes.The end users of the product are a pain in the ass. They are the finance bros and they have an attitude problem. I do not like working for them or along with them. They don’t understand the complexity of software systems. They think just because a feature sounds so simple in their head it’s simple to build as well. The top-layer engineering leadership is also uninspiring. Their only motivation is (and they’ve spoken this out loud multiple times) to keep the finance bros happy and not lose our credibility in front of them. It feels like my job only exists to please them. Which is why in my head I want to change jobs, maybe look for something more interesting, fun and inspiring. But then I’m reminded of my star manager and amazing team. What if I’m actually very lucky where I am right now? What if I change jobs and it’s a stupid decision? I could be stuck somewhere where the manager is ass and working against me. I don’t know what to do. Is your guys’ work like this as well?",

I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something. These posts saturate social media to the point where it seems like the only paths to wealth are: Get a big tech internship while in school and land a return offer, make a 7 figure startup, or be banished to irrelevancy.I'm interested in those of you that were (are) in my shoes; what would you recommend someone like me do to keep progressing their career and land a reputable job in some big tech company? Is it just a matter of experience and interview prep, or should I be doing more like getting a masters?

        "content": "Hey guys! I just got an offer as a contractor for a 9-5 position at a startup that secured really decent amount of Seed Capital. Very high profile team, also it is an AI Startup, so I believe it would be a great way to grow my career. It is a remote position. I am currently working with another startup, which are not that competitive and we have been working over 3 years now. It is really flexible job, I actually travel a lot and we don't have any work hours, I just need to get my tasks done and join regular calls. New position is offering 50% more pay, and possibility of getting raise as soon as I adopt the team. Downside is it is 9-5 job and I am in Europe, so I would need to work at late hours here. Should I accept the offer? There are no benefits since it is a contract based position, but I might get myself a much better offer from them if I prove myself in the team (maybe not!) What would you guys do? :)",

        "author": "iMakeBaadChoices",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Long story short, I landed an amazing job as a SWE. It's at a very well known FAANG+ company and the team is sort of new and we'll be working on some interesting problems. Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.Then there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).I never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.I realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.So, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated! **Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

We’ve gone through an entire test campaign with not many issues and now that someone else is working on the code as well (it’s ready to be expanded) this person in particular has so many opinions on it. Also the comments just don’t stop. I’ve gone through THREE rounds of comments and actions that I’ve handled and one round was mostly a bunch of I actions on something he misunderstood. The latest round is regarding how information is displayed, which no one else has had an issue with 6+ people, actively using the information given to debug every single issue we’ve had so far. All the info required to debug is present and there, but it could be cleaned up a little. I just don’t understand how my ticket for implementation of new features became the clean up the test steps display ticket. Am I being immature? How should I handle this?",

I'm in meetings 6 hours a day, have to achieve increasingly difficult timelines, need to plan ahead for upcoming sprints and further on the roadmap, make sure capacity is being fully utilized, parallelize as much of the work as possible, help the developers grow, unblock them, provide technical leadership, accelerate them to meet deadlines, provide feedback to their managers, etc.Run on sentence is intended, but the main idea is that I'm overwhelmed with all that I'm responsible for. I have a project manager type person to support me, and recently we've had a more productive relationship in a way that they manage the backlog in Jira independently after we've scoped out the work and what can be done in parallel. They've started using ChatGPT to initially populate the details and we later review each of the stories when it's closer to the time someone needs to pickup the work. I have trouble gauging when my engineers are underperforming, or if I haven't provided enough support. I'm use to holding myself to my own standards, but I also feel like it's not fair to hold others to my own standards, because while they work for me and my personality, I feel like it's too high of a bar to force on others unless they opt in.I continually think about just leaving and being an IC somewhere else, but I also feel like 30 years from now I wont want to be an IC due to the changing landscape of the CS world.I think what I'm looking for is advice on how others manage it. It feels like as soon as I got good at the engineering part, I don't spend nearly as much time engineering. Managing other people in delivery feels like a different skillset than the one that I've been focusing on for most of my career.",

I don't feel like I grew as a developer for some of those years. I still feel like a junior dev sometimes. Mid-level at best. Most of my work has been very similar bug fixes and QOL upgrades. I have been gradually gaining trust to work on larger issues over the years though, especially recently. I've suggested and implemented some design changes for certain modules, but most were small changes. Recently, while working on some bug fixes, I realized that a certain system needs a pretty dramatic re-design, which I am currently working on. We also have a relatively new dev and since we've returned to office, I've kinda been her default mentor for showing her how some of our systems work. This led me to thinking that I may be closer for a senior position than I originally thought.I know my technical skills still need a lot of improving.

In school i’ve done a handful of cool personal projects and projects for class but nothing crazy. Now i’m in a real corporate environment and it’s all a bit overwhelming and nauseating. I ask lots of questions but still don’t feel like I’m getting many answers. The corporate lingo confuses me and I have a notebook full of acronyms that sometimes still don’t even make sense. I’m supposed to be starting actual dev work tomorrow, hopefully nothing crazy, but I’m not familiar with the languages and frameworks that I will be using. I want to learn and get a return offer but these codebases are HUGE. Larger than anything I’ve personally worked with and I don’t even really know where to start to understand how to approach a task I’m given. Any advice from anyone, current interns, previous interns, full time employees, anyone. I just really need some insight. Am I dumb?

The only remotely complicated thing I have done is a concurrent implementation of an event message that's pushed into Kafka. I take help often I make silly mistakes and don't really know what I'm doing most of the time. I don't come up with solutions I sometimes fill in the blanks if my senior gives me a hint. I really don't know why I'm not getting any negative feedback from anyone I truly don't know even if I take forever to finish simple stuff they say it's nothing out of ordinary to take a few days extra.My question: I'm not good at this I can't solve real problems I don't know what I am doing and somehow got lucky with a team and company.how do I deal with my own mediocrity?

I am also wondering if anyone here has websites they reccomend or if there was a nice route to transition into IT from a cs degree. I have only got 2 callbacks, but I think those have failed as they did the usual we will contact you later. I suspect my greatest limitation maybe the fact im limiting myself to Georgia, but Atlanta had a lot of new companies open up tech companies there so it might be on me. I will remain hopeful though and with an open mind. I saw more ai websites and stuff like that and was wondering if anyone used any of those or any other strategy I may not know about.

In my current company of employment, a QA Automation dev is on the same payscale as a front-end web developer. We have had front end devs move into QA and QA Automation, but we never had anyone move out of Automation into, well, anywhere else.

For the next 3 years, I grew it to a team of 40 people and was in active negotiations with Nvidia to introduce RTX into our game (it was 2019 when Nvidia just published it). I was studying just enough to keep the scholarship, but nothing more.After we ran out of funding, and closing it, I joined an American based startup as VP of Product & engineering, but after 6 months got promoted to CIO, where I was responsible for our product portfolio and managing our engineering and R&D departments.During this time, I got headhunted by one of the largest corporations in Europe and wanted me to work as Senior Project Manager (had to wear Product Manager hat too often). They made it clear, they wanted me no mater what, doubled my salary and put me in big projects to work for. And after 2.5 years, it was one of the most amazing working experiences as had to deal with hundreds of engineers and millions of dollars in projects.After some internal things, I decided to go in business on my own, and start a digital agency. it was one of the roughest experiences even though within 1 year I had 3 other employees and 15 clients. And decided to close this in beginning of June.\\-- now July --I had an interview today, and one of the HR said that my CV seems like I'm lying. I just turned 29, so it is impossible for me to have done all of this. (I have recommendation letters, experience, posts and everything to prove my work...). I asked some of my friends about this and they said the same thing too, and even suggested I lower the tittle for example from CIO to just Head of Product Management Office.I'm looking to join startups where I can bring best of my experience and knowledge, but I am seriously getting worried what my friends are suggesting.from 50 tailored applications I have done, I've had only 1 interview, so I'm really wondering if ATS is screwing me up, or HR see's it and thinks \"just bloated stuff\" and ignores it.What do you think?im seriously stuck thinking for this.PS: made this post on EU version but got automatically removed.",

Tbh, we hardly had meetings and just had stand up oince a day and outside of that it was mostly reaching out to people for help and once a month a product meeting with the clients. Once a quarter we had a 2 day sprint planning event that really was a waste of 2 days with most engineers just nodding along while the managers and POs did all the talking.Second job was in FAANG - it seemed like even as a mid-level Engineer I had to spend half my day in meetings, a quarter of my day reaching out to people and the rest of the time coding. Obviously 2 hours coding isnt enough, so it caused people to have to work an extra 2-4 hours a day. Stand up was everyday for 30 minutes. No meetings friday was hardly respected. If you werent it felt like you were behind if your days didnt look like this. It was very on the go. Even in the meetings, it felt like everything was a discussion that took an extra hour of meeting time. ANythign brought up during parking lot took an hour to resolve. You put a for loop but a principal engineer wants you to do a while loop? Let's discuss it for an hour about why for loops are better or worse. If you needed to talk to anybody, you had to schedule time and theyd get annoyed if you went over the alloted scheduled time. It was stressfula nd when I left I was glad I was gone.Current job is at big tech but not FAANG - It seems meetings are the last thing on their mind. We have stand up twice a week. Twice a month we have an extended stand up. Even then it goes by pretty quickly (most of the time it takes half the scheduled time). Parking lot items are resolved really fast unless someone is confused about the code. Im still fairly new but i get the vibe that it's similar to my first job where you can just reach out to someone and tehy didnt mind spending an hour with you to talk it through. Once a quarter they do a \"no meetings week\" where major meetings are cancelled. This was a shocker i've never heard about, in my last job that is something laughable and seen as a waste of useful time. What's surprsiing is I make more in this job than I did in FAANG for what seems like will be less stress.Just wondering how common it is in other jobs when it comes to meetings?Edit: im 7 YOE as a backend SWE if that helps.",

        "content": "Hey everybody!For context: I'm Polish, 21 years old, first year into the CS degree, and 10 months of experience on my first job.When I landed the job, I was exhilarated. But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice? Anybody who is/was in a similar situation who wants to share?",

In the job listing it says \"Position is an internship and does not offer salary until candidate is formally onboarded\". However, on the call they stated that compensation won't be offered until their project receives funding. The company has multiple projects that have received funding, but the one I applied for is very early and has not. I'm a fresh grad with no internships unfortunately and I need experience, but I also need pay, and this job seems to expect a full time commitment which I would not be able to balance with my current part time job that does pay.The biggest thing holding me back from taking this role is that the company is \"employee owned\" and during the meeting they talked about how ownership is taken by everybody and there will most likely not be a senior ahead of me providing guidance. I feel like I already know the answer, since I have bills to pay, but just curious as to what others would do in this situation.",

        "author": "besseddrest",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've got 17 YOE but self taught, primarily frontend.I haven't been doing DSA a long time but I understand the most common ones I see in interviews (and honestly in my entire career I've rarely gotten LC in an interview, and yes I do think it's important for FE).w/ LC or any algo problem on any site, the problem I've found is I spend way too much time correcting for edge cases, or smaller bugs, and then I end up butchering my original solution to fit. It never fits, n this just tells me I don't actually know the algo well enough.I've developed some newer habits while prepping for some upcoming interviews, and I find that this approach I can learn the mechanics of the problem thoroughly and surprisingly I get success only after a couple clicks.I still spend a lot of time sussing out my solution, but in the end I feel like I really understand what to do.Basically:* I read the problem and based off what I currently know I just try to work it out in my head. I don't even write anything down. I just try to visualize it, with my current set of tools. A lot of walking around the house, talking to myself.* After I kinda adjust everything in my head, I open up AI chat and then i tell it my approach. I don't ask for code, I just want it to tell me what it thinks of my approach* I go back and forth repeatedly with AI on this. Until I have a better sense of what I want to code. Rinse & repeat, I still haven't written or asked for code* If i can't formulate something then I go to YT and look for a short on how the problem is generally solved - Neetcode is great for this because he'll visualize it for you before diving into code. I try to make sense of it before seeing how he solves the problem, but if it clicks then i don't even bother, but he does write in python often - I'm primiarly JS/TS so its nice that i still have to do the translation in my head* Then I finally start writing my approach and since I've gone over it repeatedly in my head, I have better direction. Your IDE will identify most of the silly bugs so, you just need to return something - this is my own IDE, not in LC's code editor.* When I'm done, I don't even run it - I just have AI review it and tell me again where I\"ve messed something up. Again, no code, just more back and forth with AI. Maybe I find that there's prob a better approach, so I redo my solution.* When AI (claude in my case) says it looks good, then I finally run it in leetcode/whatevercode. Usually there's minimal things i need to fix. I've been getting successful submits on the first tryTLDRThis is basically me, a visual learner, self taught - drilling into my head what I think will be a solid approach based off what I actually understand well. The repetition and being corrected _in discussion_ is really really good for me. A lot more time is spent thinking about the problem and talking through the different parts of the solution. The least amount of time is on the code, and there's almost no trial and error clicking. Feels great.The funny part is I don't really have the patience to go through the entire AI response, so I kinda skim just for \"this is where the problem is\". I don't even read the whole thing because I try to connect the dots of what its suggesting, on my own.Anyway, hope this helps. And yes, it's midnight on a Friday, and I'm workin on DSA. Cheers!",

        "content": "I graduated in May 2025 but I have had basically no success in applying to places, most of the time I don't even get the screening phone call and there's only been a few times where I went anywhere further than that. I'm starting to feel like I won't ever get any actually good job at all.Most positions I see have hundreds of applicants, which makes me think I'll never get in any of them. I am not a top 0.1% candidate, I don't have million dollar side projects, years of experience or a lot of charisma. Plus, there are not a lot of new grad openings in my area (Indiana) and I'm pretty sure I get filtered out of any applications I make to anywhere outside of the state (exactly 0 places out of state actually went further than the first application before throwing my resume in the garbage). Obviously it's a bad idea to move somewhere else without a job lined up, but pretty much everywhere is only hiring locally? There's also the problem where more recently it seems like all the entry level stuff has completely dried up, I only find one thing every few days at this point (everything else seems to want people who are 3+ years of experience in everything for something that says \"entry level\") (Even when I look for random low level help desk and other things they want people with a ton of experience always, and also they want \"excellent communicators\" which is something I am not)My [resume](https://imgur.com/a/xnfQFTn) is pretty bad but there's nothing significant I can change about it. The internships I got in college weren't really very computer science oriented (a lot of hardware stuff) which is just a big red flag on my resume I can't do anything with (sidenote: company A is like 1 guy so I probably can't go back there for a job, it's also not very programming based so I don't want to do it forever either). (sidenote 2: Yes I tried to get other internships, but my resume was even worse back then and the market wasn't exactly much better back then versus now). It probably looks bad that I had internships in the summer only but company A is a local place so I can't exactly stay there while going to college. I don't have metrics for everything which makes it look bad (are interns really supposed to be doing corporate espionage to look at company records to see the exact dollar value of everything they did?) (And I can't really lie and make up stuff since that would just look like obvious lies, some of the metrics I already have are already like that)I had a 3.93 GPA for my bachelors but that isn't actually very good (one of the people that interviewed me actually grilled me for not having a perfect 4.0, probably a reason I got rejected). Project wise I just have some projects on there, but those projects aren't \"real\" projects since 2 of them were class projects and the other one is something that didn't make money so companies probably just see it as just a random toy project. I'm also not an expert in all the 10 random technologies that get put in every job posting as well, which probably leads me to getting tossed out (even if I was, companies probably ignore everything that wasn't something I did in internships which cuts me out of 99% of positions)(My parents want me to apply to every random X years of experience position out there, which just seems pointless since in what world would I be put above the people who actually have X years of experience?)**Other things*** Networking * Networking is a complete non starter as I don't have the social skills to ever convince someone that I'm the best person for the job. My personality is pretty unlikeable (very introverted, don't like talking, not really capable of showing enthusiasm) and I have very little in common with other people * The people I've encountered in my classes aren't really going to help me either (presumably most of them are now entry level people as well and so they have 0 influence on the hiring process of any company) * There's basically 0 chance I become the hiring managers best friend and become someone they push ahead of other people* Internships * Not in college anymore, internships only take current students* Projects * Making a \"good project\" isn't something I can just do. To make the kind of project that actually impresses employers I would have to make a significant amount of money, and those kind of ideas are very hard to come by. Plus, that kind of thing would take 1 year or several years to actually produce which I can't exactly spend that amount of time unemployed (or in some menial dead end job) without leaving me stuck in that job because they think I can't do anything better* Do more leetcode * 99% of the time I don't even get to a point where they even give me any kind of technical evaluation, so it doesn't really help me to practice that more. It's not something I can put in a job application to get further* Move somewhere with more jobs * Terrible idea, I don't have a ton of money to waste moving out somewhere (especially considering how badly my job search is going, moving somewhere else isn't going to magically be 100x better)* Lie on resume * Also a complete non starter. I don't have the charisma to back up lies on my resume. Stretching experience numbers is something I'm already doing, but I can't just make up years of experience out of nowhere without making it look like obvious lies * If I say I have experience at X place then that would get seen in a background check and then I get thrown out immediately",

Having a difficult time finding a new job -- I think part of it is that only 2.5 years puts me at an uncomfortable position where I'm not a new grad but also not exactly an experienced dev, but the other problem is that I just feel like I... can't *do* anything. At my company I spent the majority of the time on our bug-fixing team. Idk if this is how things usually are at big companies but our codebase was largely undocumented and no one ever explained to me how anything really worked -- everything I learned I learned because I asked about it directly. Most of the bugs I fixed were either very clear-cut, where I could just look at the code and identify the problem, or for more abstract ones I did it with a lot of guidance from a senior dev. I spent a bit of time on other teams \"helping\" implement new features but I was largely in over my head and being held by the hand by my seniors while just trying to absorb whatever I could. So I know how to code I guess. I can pick up new languages and I can look at simple things and sort of understand what they're doing and I understand principles like data structures, algorithms, encapsulation, inheritance, etc, all stuff you would find in a college course. I've also done 100+ puzzles on AdventOfCode, which I usually find to be not super difficult but have also learned about stuff I wasn't super knowledgeable about like dynamic programming and sorting algos while doing them. I feel like I'm a good employee. I'm not afraid to ask questions and I'm well-spoken and I'm proactive about my work rather than sitting in silence when I get stuck. I love to learn new stuff and always take opportunities that are presented to me. But I don't feel like any of my knowledge transfers to an actual workplace environment. I can't build apps or deploy microservices or optimize software or develop new features. I subscribe to /r/programming and read stuff there but I usually understand like 5% of it. I thought I would learn once I got my first job but I spent most of that time fixing bugs and trying to understand how our product even worked. I was discussing moving to a different team to start gaining more skills with my supervisor but then I was laid off. I know lots of programmers build stuff in their free time but I have no idea what to even make. I don't even know if I *can* make anything. So what do I do? How do I learn? Hope I get a better job? Do a boot camp? Grad school?Would be very greatful to hear how any of you transitioned from being a booksmart college level programmer to an actual developer",

I have come to a brick wall, and I feel stuck. I am stuck working on maintenance of legacy software with developers who are not interested in learning new technology and are good with being where they are. That is completely understandable for me, but I know I can provide more and I know I can do more. Tried getting transfered into a team which actually does Software Development but I cannot get transfered because they allocated me on maintenance projects until further notice. I work for a minimal wage, asked for a raise but am getting ghosted, and was declined for a job after passing 4 rounds of interview. Basically I want to hear your opinion and any tips for where I should go with my career. I feel really stuck...",

        "content": "this pop up on my Linkedin feed. A guy posted that he's applied to over 1,500 jobs, landed 3 interviews, and believes many job listings aren't active or were never meant to be filled. Companies might leave them up to collect resumes, appear like they're growing, or fulfill policy requirements.My previous manager, whom I liked, left around April this year. Since April, I've been applying for jobs that i like, close to 80 so far. I've noticed that many job listings on LinkedIn are weeks old and still show up in my job search alerts.This experience makes me wonder if ghost jobs are indeed real. What's your experience with job hunting? Have you encountered any ghost jobs?",

There's really nothing to learn nor am I content with my salary so it's time to leave.Just finished with my phone interview recently. 30 minutes of behavioral with camera on and 30 minutes of a Leetcode problem. Was asked to implement autocomplete (trie tree). Have very few more screening in coming days. Surprisingly, it takes maybe 1 month for some to reach out. I have seen some of my co-workers finding new gigs and posting them on LinkedIn. Job market sucks but I am going to keep my habit of rinse and repeat.",
