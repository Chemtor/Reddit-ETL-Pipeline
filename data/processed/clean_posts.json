Are they going to make real-time, sub-minute decision with all this CDC updates that you're spending so much money to extract? No?

I keep running into the same pain: just a pile of big text files. Files and object storage look simple, but in practice they slow me down. One task turns into many blobs across different places – messy. No clear schema. Even with databases, small join changes break things. The orchestrator can’t “see” the data, so batching is poor, retries are clumsy, and my GPUs sit idle.My friend helped me rethink the whole setup. What finally worked was treating everything as tables with transactions – one namespace, clear schema for samples, runs, evals, and lineage. I snapshot first, then measure, so numbers don’t drift. Queues are data-aware: group by token length or expected latency, retry per row. After this, fewer mystery bugs, better GPU use, cleaner comparisons.He wrote his view here: [https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra](https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra)Does anyone here run AI workloads on transactional, table-first storage instead of files?

        "content": "I’ve been following (and using) the Apache Iceberg ecosystem for a while now. Early on, I had the same mindset most teams do: files + a simple SQL engine + a cron is plenty. If you’re under \\~100 GB, have one writer, a few readers, and clear ownership, keep it simple and ship.But the thing that was important was ofcourse “scale.” and the metadata. Well i took a good look at a couple of blogs to come to a conclusion for this one and also there came a need of it.So iceberg treats metadata as the system of record. Once you see that, a bunch of features stop feeling advanced and just a reminder most of the points here are for when you will scale.* Well one thing it has is Pruning without reading data, column stats (min/max/null counts) per file let engines skip almost everything before touching storage.* bad load? this was one i came across.. you’re just moving a metadata pointer to a clean snapshot.* Concurrent safety on object stores wtih optimistic transactions against the metadata, so it’s all-or-nothing, even with multiple writers.* Well nonetheless a lot of other big names do this but just putting it here schema/partition evolution tracked by stable IDs, so renames/reorders don’t break history.So if you arae a startup be simple but be prepared and it's okay to start boring. But the moment you feel pain schema churn, slower queries, more writers, hand-rolled cleanups Iceberg’s metadata intelligence starts paying for itself.If you’re curious about how the layers fit together (snapshots, manifests, stats, etc.), I wrote up a deeper breakdown in the blog above Don’t invent distributed systems problems you don’t have but don’t ignore the metadata advantages that are already there when you do.",

I'm currently working on a personal project based on a Library system (I asked AI to generate the project criteria, and I'm focusing on building the data model myself).**The system represents a public library that:*** Manages a collection of over 20,000 books and magazines* Allows users to borrow and reserve books* Has employees responsible for system operations* Applies fines for late returns**My main question is:** When designing this kind of system, at what point should I prefer normalization (to avoid redundancy) and when should I consider denormalization (for performance or analytical purposes)? Should I keep everything normalized as in a typical OLTP design, or should I denormalize certain parts for faster reporting?**For example:** If I have the following tables `publisher` and `user` and they both have `city`, `street`, and `state` fields - should I create another table named `address`? Or leave it as is?Any guidance would be appreciated!\\----EDIT: Thank you so much guys, your answers really shed light on this topic for me>",

And for sure, lots of SQL queries. And in the near future, we are going to retire some of the flat files and migrate them to our data warehouse, and we are aiming to improve our current ML model as well. I really enjoy what I'm doing, and have no complaints about the work environment.

If you were me, will you aim for jobs with better pay and just settle in the same environment and see if I can get a promotion or find a better role internally?\\--------------------Edit--------------------I dm the comments asking about the Bootcamp, I will not post it here as it is not my intention.

It was a cool experience and I really learned a lot. I didn’t know much about data engineering before hand and I was wondering, how much time do DEs really spending on the “plumbing”? This was my first exposure to the medial data structure as well so idk if it’s different for other places that don’t use that but is that like a huge part of being a data engineer? It’s it mainly building out these cleanses tables? I know when new data sources are brought it that there is set up there, I was part of that too but I feel like the bulk of what was going on was building out silver and gold layers. How much time do you guys actually spend on that kind of work? And is it mundane as it can seem at time? Or did I just have easy work haha",

A couple of years ago I switched to a data architecture role at a tech company. Since day 1 I've felt behind my peers who I feel have much stronger skills in data modeling. With my consulting background and lack of formal CS learning, I feel like my knowledge of a traditional development lifecycle are missing and consequently feel like I deliver sub par work, along with other imposter syndrome type effects. Realistically I know the company wanted me for my experience and skills and maybe to be different to existing employees but I can't shake the feeling of unease. Any suggestions to improve here? Stick it out longer and hope things become clearer (they have over time but it's still hard to keep up), or return to the consulting world where I was more comfortable but now armed with a few more technical skills and less corporate bullshit.",

My role started off as a support data engineer but in the past few months, my manager has been giving the support team more development tasks since we all wanted to grow our technical skills. I have also been assigned some development tasks in the past few months, mostly fixing a bug or adding validation frameworks in different parts of a production job. Before I was the one asking for more challenging tasks and wanted to work on development tasks but now that I have been given the work, I feel like I have only disappointed my manager. In the past few months, I feel like pretty much every PR I merged ended up having some issue that either broke the job or didn’t capture the full intention of the assigned task. At first, I thought I should be testing better. Our testing environments are currently so rough to deal with that just setting them up to test a small piece of code can take a full day of work. Anyway, I did all that but even then I feel like I keep missing some random edge case or something that I failed to consider which ends up leading to a failure downstream. And I just constantly feel so dumb in front of my manager. He ends up having to invest so much time in fixing things I break and he doesn’t even berate me for it but I just feel so bad. I know people say that if your manager reviewed your code then its their responsibility too, but I feel like I should have tested more and that I should be more holistic in my considerations. I just feel so self-conscious and low on confidence. The annoying thing is that the recent validation thing I worked on, we introduced it to other teams too since it would affect their day-to-day tasks but turns out, my current validation framework technically works but it will also result in some false positives that I now need to work on. But other teams know that I am the one who set this up and that I failed to consider something so anytime, these false positives show up (until I fix it), it will be because of me. I just find it so embarrassing and I know it will happen again because no matter how much I test my code, there is always something that I will miss. It almost makes me want to never PR into production and just never write development code, keep doing my support work even though I find that tedious and boring but at least its relatively low stakes…I am just not feeling very good and doesn’t help that I feel like I am the only one making these kind of mistakes in my team and being a burden on my manager, and ultimately creating more work for him with my mistakes…Like I think even the new person on the team isn’t making as many mistakes as I am..",

What I don't know is if they are common because business analytical requirements dictate it, or if I, as DE, will benefit from it.Also, there's the issue of cost. Using Iceberg (what I would use) on S3 to achieve h.s. must increase costs: on what factor? what does the increase depend on?Edit 1h later: Thanks to all of you for taking the time to reply.Edit 1h later number 2: Conclusions drawn: The a) absence of a clear answer to the question and the presence of b) b.1) references to data modeling, business requirements and other analytical concepts, plus b.2) an unreasonable amount (>0) of avoidable unkind comments to the question, made me c) form this thin layer of new knowledge: There is no reason to think about historical snapshots of data in an environment where it's not required by downstream analytics or business requirements.

This retail company sets annual targets in dollars for purchases and sales, so these targets are yearly. The fact table als has a Year attribute. A solution might be to use a Date attribute?Ultimately, I need to create a table visualization in PowerBI that combines data from these two fact tables along with some additional measures.Sometimes, I need to filter by type, so TransactionType and TargetType must be linked.I feel like using a bridge table might be “cheating,” so I’m curious: what would be the correct approach according to Kimball principles?",

Would love input from people who’ve optimized ClickHouse for analytical workloads like this — maybe memory limits, parallelism, or query-level optimizations? Currently, some queries (like Q21, Q8, Q17) are 40–60x slower on the same hardware, while others (Q15, Q16) are roughly on par. Data volume is 10GB. Current Clickhouse config highlights:* `max_threads = 16`* `max_memory_usage = 45 GB`* `max_server_memory_usage = 106 GB`* `max_concurrent_queries = 8`* `max_bytes_before_external_sort = 73 GB`* `join_use_nulls = 1`* `allow_experimental_correlated_subqueries = 1`* `optimize_read_in_order = 1`The test environment used: AWS r5d.4xlarge (16 vCPUs, 124 GB RAM, RAID0 on two NVMe drives).

Science, finance, etc. There's lots of areas. AI is expected to help breakdown those barriers to increase the consumption of complicated subject matters.

Garbage data isn't going to work anymore, in any industry, as the years roll on.This isn't just true for those complicated areas, all industries will need better data. Anyone who wants to be a player in the future is going to have to upgrade and/or completely re-write their existing systems since the vast majority of data systems today produce garbage data. Partly due to businesses in-adequality budgeting for it. There is a good portion of companies that will have to completely restart their data operations, relegating their current data useless and/or obsolete. Operational, transactional, analytical, etc. This is just to get high integrity data. To implement data into products needing application/operational data feeds where AI is also expected to expand?

        "content": "Hello! Been a reader in this sub for quite some time. I have started a part time job where I am tasked to create a dashboard. No specific software is being required by the client, but I have chosen Looker Studio because the client is using Google as their work environment (sheets + drive). I would love to keep the cost low, or in this case totally free for the client but it's kinda hard working with Looker (I say PBI has better features imo). I am new in this so I don't wanna overcharge the client with my services, thankfully they don't demand much or give a very strict deadline.I have done all my transforms in my own personal work Gmail using Drive + Sheets + Google Apps Script because all of the raw data are just csv files. My dashboard is working and setup as intended, but it's quite hard to do the \"queries\" I need for each visualization -- I just do a single sheet for each \"query\" because star schema and joins does not work for Looker? I feel like I can do this better, but I am stuck.Here are my current concerns:1. If the client asks for more, like automation and additional dashboard features, would you have any suggestions as to how I can properly scale my workflow? I have read about GCP's storage and Bigquery, tried the free trial and I setup it wrong as my credits was depleted in a few days?? I think it's quite costly and overkill for a data that is less than 50k rows according to ChatGPT. 2. Per my title, how can I \"sell\" this project to the client? What I mean is if in case the client wants to end our contract, like if they are completely satisfied with my simple automation, how can I transfer the ownership to them if I am currently using my personal email?*PS. I am* ***not*** *a Data analyst by profession nor working in Tech. I am just a guy who likes to try stuff and thankfully I got the chance to work on a real project after doing random Youtube ETL and dashboard projects. Python is my main language, so doing the above work using GAS(Javascript via ChatGPT lol) is quite a new experience to me.*",

My proposed plan is to first pull that data, use a library like pandas to do some initial cleaning and organization, and then convert it into compressed Parquet files. We'd then place these files in a staging area and most likely our cloud blob storage but we're flexible and could use Snowflake's internal stage as well.My specific question is about what happens to the data size when we copy it from those Parquet files into the actual Snowflake tables. I assume that when Snowflake loads the data, it's stored according to its data type (varchar, number, etc.) and then Snowflake applies its own compression.So, would the final size of the data in the Snowflake table end up being more, less, or about the same as the size of the original Parquet file? Let’s say, if I start with a 1 GB Parquet file, will the data consume more or less than 1 GB of storage inside Snowflake tables?I'm really just looking for a sanity check to see if my understanding of this entire process is on the right track.Thanks!",

Now what dlthub does is that it automatically normalizes the data and loads the arrays into subtables. I like this very much, but now upon some reading I found out that the general advice is to stick as much as possible to the raw format of the data, so in this case loading the nested arrays in JSON format in the db, or even loading the whole response as one value to a raw table with one column.Wha do you think about that? What I’m losing by normalizing it at this step, except the fact that I have a shitton of tables and I guess it’s impossible to recreate something if I don’t like the normalize logic?

In this migration project I am working solo and carrying out planning, BA, business interaction, dev, BI, QA, and data gov & administration and the scope is only getting bigger.Last week there was an ongoing discussion between scrum master trying to highlight it’s already too much for me and that I shouldn’t be engaged as the main developer in other tasks and team lead who said that I am a crucial team member and they need me in other projects as well. I am connecting with both tmw but I wanna seek your advice on how to best manage these escalating situations and not let it affect my life and health over 0 mental or financial compensation.

I've bounced around between different roles frequently, which primes me well for a leadership position but I first have some gaps to fill. I started as a BI Developer but also did the data warehouse architecture and ETL loading. I designed a data warehouse from the ground up with my manager simply coaching but zero micro managing. Then I feel like my career took an unexpected turn, I took a job at a smaller firm. It ended up being more system administration with data engineering on the side but definitely more traditional data engineering than I did as a BI dev. I didn't have a manager so the skills I really learned was working with the owners/directly with leadership but it was a small firm and not as formal as I've seen at medium to large companies. No real formal quarterly planning but I was directly responsible for anything that happened or was needed. I really learned to solve whatever problem is thrown at me and I now have the confidence to attack any problem thrown at me. On the technical side I automated their manual workflow, mistakenly using SSIS, because I didn't know better. I later migrated them to the cloud with the support of a very very good consultant. He really liked my ability to learn and solve new problems and I'm still in contact with him today. After migration my job became more of a system administrator but also added new sources to the pipeline. No architecture or modeling responsibilities though. Next I found a job as an architect based in the cloud. Once again I had no technical people above me. I think this job was a a reach for me, I didn't know what I didn't know and oversold myself. Still I made it work and got my cloud pipelines built but mostly using the interface vs coding the way I expect most companies to work. We used S3, glue, RDS and lambda. This was short lived due to funding for the project and likely because I was over my head. Her I took a step back and just wanted to be a data engineer at a medium to large company. This was all good until we got offshored. I'm now working through the remaining months of that job while I look for a new one. Unfortunately it seems the traditional data flow knowledge isn't very wanted anymore and I spent the last 7 years learning more of the administration and leadership side vs technical skills. Am I simply screwed? Do I have to scramble to learn spark and get AWS engineering certified before I'll be valuable to a company again? I keep getting calls from Linkin recruiters who want me to lead a cloud engineering team but I'm looking for a job as one of those engineers, not their leader. The salary doesn't even seem to be the issue, the issue is no one is looking for general data skills to help train into cloud engineers. I knew u was goin to have to learn throughout my career but I didn't expect this drastic of a shift. I almost fell like front end web developers are in a better position than traditional data people.",

They have another team of backend engineers with a dozen employees. This allow the company to have backend engineers taking part of an on call in turns (with a financial compensation). However on my side it's impossible to have such thing in place as it would mean I'd be on call all the time (illegal & not desirable).The main pain point is that regularly (2-3 times/month) backend engineers break our data infrastructure on prod with some fix releases they made while on call. I also feel that sometimes they deploy new features as I receive DB schema updates with new tables on the weekend (I don't see many cases where fixing a backend error would imply to create a new table).Sometimes I fix those failures over the weekend on my personal time if I caught the alert notifications but sometimes I just don't check my phone or work laptop. Backend engineers are not responsible for the data infra like me, most of them don't know how it works and they don't have access to it for security reasons.In such situation what would be the best solution?Training the backend engineers on our data infra and give them access so they fix their mess when it happens ?Put myself on call time to time hoping I caught most of the outside working hours errors ?Insist to not deploy new features (schema changes) over the weekend ?For now I am considering asking for time compensation on case I had to work over the weekend to fix things, but not sure if this is viable on long term, especially as it's not on my contract.Thanks for your insight.",

Currently writing scripts to extract data from the pdf’s, but the way it gets exported by client is usually different, resulting in the scripts not working anymore. So we have to redo them. Combine this with 100’s of different clients with different extract forms, and you can see why this is a major headache.Any recommendations? (And no, we can not tell them how to send us the data)",

The tricky part: there’s no change tracking, so right now any update means a full re-ingestion.Stack-wise, we’re on AWS, using Qdrant for the vector store, Temporal for workflow orchestration, and Terraform for IaC. Down the line, we’ll also build a data lake, so I’m trying to keep the chatbot infra modular and future-proof.My current idea: API → S3 (raw) → chunk + embed → upsert into Qdrant. Temporal would handle orchestration.I’m debating whether I should spin up a separate metadata DB (like DynamoDB) to track ingestion state, chunk versions, and file progress or just rely on Qdrant payload metadata for now.If you’ve built RAG systems or large-scale vector pipelines:* How did you handle re-ingestion when delta updates weren’t available?* Is maintaining a metadata DB worth it early on?* Any lessons learned or “wish I’d done this differently” moments?Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.

Set value = orig\\_value, unless business updates the record. Something like:|value|orig\\_value||:-|:-||A|A|Then, after updating the record:|value|orig\\_value||:-|:-||B|A|Is there any reason NOT to do it this way? Business will make the updates to records by editing an upstream table via a file upload. I feel that this approach would simplify the SQL logic; a simple coalesce would do the job. Plus having only one column change as opposed to multiple feels cleaner, and the column names can communicate the intent of these fields better.",

        "content": "I currently work full time as an operational analyst in the energy industry. This is my first job out of college, and I make around mid 79K(base). I’m also in grad school for Data Science and AI, and my classes are in person. My job isn’t very technical right now. It’s more operational and repetitive, and my manager doesn’t really let me get involved in data or reporting work. My long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role.I recently got an offer from another company in a different industry. The pay is in the low 80s and the role is hybrid with about two to three days in the office. It’s a bit more technical than what I do now since it focuses on Power BI and reporting, but it’s still not super advanced or coding heavy. The new job offers more PTO and I’d have more autonomy to build models and learn skills on my own. The only catch is that raises aren’t guaranteed or significant.Here’s my situation. My current company is fully in person but it’s less than 10 miles from home and school. The new job is 30 to 40 miles each way, so the commute would be a lot longer even though it’s hybrid. At the beginning of next year, I’ll be eligible to apply for internal transfers into more data driven departments. However, I’m not sure how guaranteed that process really is since this is my first job in the industry. If I do move into a different role internally, the pay becomes much more competitive, but again it’s not something I can fully rely on. I’m also due for a raise of around 4 percent, a bonus, and about 3K in tuition reimbursement that I’d lose if I left now.Financially, the new offer doesn’t change much. Maybe a few hundred more a month after taxes, but it offers hybrid flexibility, slightly more technical work, and a bit more freedom.Would you stay until the beginning of next year to collect the raise and bonus and then try to move internally into a more data focused role? Or would you take the hybrid offer in a new domain for the Power BI experience and flexibility, even though the commute is longer and the pay difference is small?TL;DR: First job out of college making mid 70K offered a low 80s hybrid role that’s a little more technical (Power BI and reporting) but in a new industry with longer commute and no guaranteed raises. Current job is closer to home and school, and I’ll get a raise, bonus, and tuition reimbursement if I stay until the beginning of next year plus a chance to transfer internally, though I’m not sure how guaranteed that is. If I move internally, the pay would be much more competitive, but it’s still a risk. Long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role. Not sure if I should stay or take the new role.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'd like to share a project I've been working on called **Flint**:Flint transforms data engineering by shifting from custom code to declarative configuration for complete ETL pipeline workflows. The framework handles all execution details while you focus on what your data should do, not how to implement it. This configuration-driven approach standardizes pipeline patterns across teams, reduces complexity for ETL jobs, improves maintainability, and makes data workflows accessible to users with limited programming experience.The processing engine is abstracted away through configuration, making it easy to switch engines or run the same pipeline in different environments. The current version supports Apache Spark, with Polars support in development.It is not intended to replace all pipeline programming work but rather make straightforward ETL tasks easier so engineers can focus on more interesting and complex problems.See an example configuration at the bottom of the post. Check out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)## Why I Built ItTraditional ETL development has several pain points:- Engineers spend too much time writing boilerplate code for basic ETL tasks, taking away time from more interesting problems- Pipeline logic is buried in code, inaccessible to non-developers- Inconsistent patterns across teams and projects- Difficult to maintain as requirements change## Key Features- **Pure Configuration**: Define sources, transformations, and destinations in JSON or YAML- **Multi-Engine Support**: Run the same pipeline on Pandas, Polars, or other engines- **100% Test Coverage**: Both unit and e2e tests at 100%- **Well-Documented**: Complete class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and design principles- **Strongly Typed**: Full type safety throughout the codebase- **Comprehensive Alerts**: Email, webhooks, files based on configurable triggers- **Event Hooks**: Custom actions at key pipeline stages (onStart, onSuccess, etc.)## Looking for Contributors!The foundation is solid - 100% test coverage, strong typing, and comprehensive documentation - but I'm looking for contributors to help take this to the next level.

        "author": "jbirdart",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I graduated in 2023 with a business degree. Took a couple Python/SQL/Stats classes in university so when I started my post-grad internship I decided to focus on analytics. Since then I have about 1 year with Tableau, beginner/passable with Python & SQL. I've done a good job for my level (at least that has been my feedback), but now I'm really worried if I can do my new job correctly. Six months ago I landed a new role that I think I was a bit underqualified for, though I am trying my best. Very large company, and very disorganized data-wise. My role is a new role made specifically for a small team that handles a niche, high volume, sensitive, complicated process. No other analysts - just one systems admin that is good at Power BI and has a ton of domain knowledge. I'm not really allowed to interface much with the other data analysts/engineers across the company since my boss thinks they won't like that I exist outside of the data-specific teams and could cause issues, at least until I have some real projects finished. So its been hard to understand what tools I can use or what the company uses. For the first 5 months my boss steered me to Dataverse - so I learned (my pro license was approved right away) and created a solution and when we went to push to prod the IT directors told us that we shouldn't be using that. I have access to one database in SMSS, and have been learning Power BI.**Here is where I'm really not sure what to do.** I was basically hired to work with data from this one external source that I'm only just now getting access to since it was in development. There are hundreds of millions of lines of data across hundreds of tables - this program is huge and really complicated, and the quality is questionable. I'm only just starting to barely understand how it works, and they hired me because I had some existing industry knowledge. My only option is to do the entire ETL process in Power BI and save the data models in Power BI. They want me to do it all - query the data directly from the source, clean/transform, store somewhere, and create dashboards with useful analytics (they already have some KPIs picked out for me to put together). The company currently uses a data lake that does not currently include this source, with no plans to set it up anytime soon. They're apparently exploring using Azure Databricks and have a sandbox setup but I'm struggling to gain access to it. I don't know what other tools they may or may not have - everything I've heard is that there is not much of anything. My boss wants me to only use Power BI, because that is what he is familiar with. I don't want to use Power BI for the entire ETL process, that's not efficient right? I would much rather use Python, and what I see of Databricks that would be great for it, but my access to that is probably not going to be anytime soon. But I'm not an expert on how any of this works. So I'm hoping to ask you guys - what would you do in my position? I want to develop useful skills and use good tools, and to do things efficiently and correctly, but I'm not sure what I have to work with here. Thank you.",

Operating systems, protocols, programming languages, databases—much of it originated or matured during that era.What's crazy is that these developers had limited computing power, no Stack Overflow, no VSCode, no GitHub Copilot... and yet, they built Unix, TCP/IP, C, early Linux, compilers, text editors, early web browsers, and more. Even now, we study their work to understand how things actually function under the hood.So my questions are:What did they actually learn back then that made them capable of such deep work?Was it just \"computer science basics\" or something more?Did having fewer abstractions make them better engineers because they had to understand everything from the metal up?Is today's developer culture too reliant on tools and frameworks, while they built things from scratch?I'm genuinely curious—did the limitations of the time force them to think differently, or are we missing something in how we approach learning today?Would love to hear from people who were around back then or who study that era.

        "content": "I only lurk on Reddit, but I have to ask. Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C and low level programming? For reference, I am in college getting a degree in IT. My degree is generally more networking, infrastructure, and cybersecurity than computer science. The only computer science classes I have to take have been in python, a web development class, and an Intro to Computer Systems class in C. I did well in web development, and I absolutely LOVED the classes in python. C has been a different animal. I had to work SO hard to barely pass Intro to Computer Systems. The content was kind of interesting, but it was a ton of work. I made it though. I decided that low level just wasn't for me and moved on. Last year, I got to take a Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation class. It was all in C, but we didn't do any actual development in C. We only reverse engineered C code, then wrote exploits in assembly or hex. I loved this class as well. It was super hard, but I really enjoyed learning about how the exploits worked. The class was geared towards security researchers, which is not what I want to do, but I still loved it. My university's computer science program recently started an Operating Systems Development class, based on MIT's xv6 operating system (RISC-V). I decided to give low level development (specifically C) a second chance, but it has not been going well. The content is interesting, but I genuinely feel too stupid to learn it. The lectures feel impossible to follow, and the labs generally take me about twice as long to complete as other students. I mostly decided to take this class to learn more about a topic I probably wouldn't learn on my own, and I don't need this class to graduate. Regardless, I don't want to drop the class. I feel like I \"can\" do it, but its been so hard. It's kinda making me think that I might just not be smart enough to do low level programming, and that I should stick to the higher level stuff where I do better. Is it possible to not be smart enough? Or am I just making a big deal out of a skill issue? I enjoy learning about the content, but it takes me so long to get the labs done. Even after I complete them, I usually don't fully understand why my bug fixes work. I try to research them, but get lost in the sauce a little bit.",

My first problem is that I feel a bit too old to just be starting to get my degree (I am 25yo right now) and feel behind most of my peers. The other thing, and perhaps the most technical one, is that I don't feel adequate.I try not to compare myself to other since doing so only seems to make feel worse. Thus, I try to compare with my past self. When doing so, I can see some real improvement (to put an example last year I was not comfortable AT ALL programing 2D arrays during my structured programming course, today I can code some programs using 3D arrays using pointers), nevertheless every now and then I come across a problem that really test me while not being overly complicated and really begin doubting my own abilities (the most recent was writing a program to calculate, using pointers, an Adjugate matrix of an user-input 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 matrix).I do my best not to rely on AI, I always work my code as far as I can on my own using stackOverflow (or similar) to look things up that I don't remember, and, if I do end up using AI, I make sure to be 100% sure of what each part of the code I used its help for does and how it works in conjunction with the rest of the code, so the next time I need to do something similar, I can do it myself.I **think** I like programming, it can be frustrating, it can be confusing, but ultimately seeing my work **do** something makes me feel proud, unfortunately that doesn't necessarily translate in getting a decent job to be able to support myself. I hear about projects that other people work on and cant see myself doing such complex tasks. This in conjunction of being in a whole different age bracket that most classmates, makes me doubt if I even have a future in this field (I am calculating, based on my missing courses, to be finishing by the time I am between 27 and 29 yo). Of course, I am already trying to see what I need to get a job while studying.Basically, I sometimes feel like I am learning, and others feels like I learned nothing at all, and being older as other freshmen/sophomores put me down a little bitDoes anyone that currently working in the field felt, or feel, like this? How did you get over it? If anyone reading previously had another degree and went back to study CS, I would love to read their experience since that is the boat I am right now.",

        "content": "Title pretty much explains the basis of what I'm writing about here, i also couldn't really find anything relevant when i was searching though I'm sure someone has probably posted something similar before. I understand that everybody is different and learning styles differ from person to person, especially people on the spectrum like me. However i know there is lots of us in this field and im just absolutely curious partially for my own benefit and for others. For those ADHD students like me who are in the beginning stages of learning entry level programming for school, what was it that engaged you in learning to program? I've heard all kinds of like use 'x' platform, code a project, watch tutorials, or something similar. But I'm not really sure where is the proper starting point, where to go to learn properly, or what kind of project to even start with if that is even the right course of action. I do thrive on structured, self paced interactive learning, but i always feel like something like codecademy is just making me write code but not even really applying it to anything. Learning theory doesn't really work for me, and while i know codecademy isn't really theory it feels kinda similar, just write random little things and then go make a big thing then forget it all pretty much when you finish and when you go to actually make something the best i can do is print a math equation or text. I'm also in school for Comp Sci and even that feels kinda the same. I really do enjoy this but knowing where to go and learn and sticking to it and having it work for me has been a real struggle. I do see a lot of others who are like me that are thriving and building things and know the syntax like its written on the back of their hands. So to reiterate the question, what was it that worked for you guys and what made you stick with it?",

Basically, my headers were including each other:- Admin.h included Employee.h- Employee.h included Client.h- Client.h included Person.h- And somehow, it looped back to Admin.hThe compiler started giving me a bunch of errors about functions not found, incomplete types, and things I didn’t understand.I solved it by:1. Separating each class into a .h and a .cpp file.2. Using forward declarations in headers instead of including other headers whenever possible.3. Including the real headers only in the .cpp files where the functions are actually implemented.After doing this, all the circular include problems disappeared and everything compiled without errors.I know this might be obvious to experienced devs, but as a beginner, it was a big “aha” moment.If anyone has tips on structuring bigger C++ projects, I’d love to hear them.",

The source code of my project2. Create their own API key 3.

        "content": "Have you ever stopped to think about which projects to develop in order to stand out on your resume, LinkedIn, or to grow professionally over time? Honestly, I’m facing this right now. I have eight months of professional experience, but my GitHub and LinkedIn are practically empty. I don’t have any project I can say, “I built this using X technology,” with a README that thoroughly explains the development, system design, and API design.Currently, I’m unemployed and want to take on this new challenge in my career. The first question that comes to mind is: **what should I develop?** I’m thinking of starting with a simple project, like a CRUD, and then adding features like table relationships, authentication and authorization, caching, etc. On the other hand, I’m wondering if it would be better to split each topic into separate solutions:* **Project 1:** CRUD and relationships* **Project 2:** Authentication and authorization* **Project 3:** Combine everything + front-endI admit I’m not very creative yet and don’t have many ideas for solving real problems, but I’ve considered the following projects:1. **To-do List** – simple, easy, and generic, but many people already do this, which could be a downside.2. **Address API** – CRUD for addresses, integrating an external API for automatic address completion. But I wonder if it makes sense to use an API just to fill in addresses.3. **Identity API** – authentication and authorization system, including forms and two types of auth: JWT and OAuth, with email verification.At the moment, I’m focusing mainly on two projects: authentication and CRUD. I plan to build a full portfolio later, once I learn Angular and can integrate back-end and front-end.**Bonus question:** From what I wrote above, my insecurity probably shows, but is it worth creating creative projects for a junior developer position, or do companies mostly just want to see that you can use the technologies and figure things out?",

However, my current knowledge is pretty basic: I know HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, and I've tinkered a little with Astro.My question is: do you recommend I just jump in and start trying to build the things I want to make (which will require using frameworks like Next.js that I've never used), or should I first learn all the theory in a structured, step-by-step way?I have a specific project in mind: a gym tracker built with Next.js (I eventually want to make it a mobile app, maybe with React Native). I'm thinking of using Supabase for the backend, as it's something I and a few friends could actually use. The problem is, I don't know where to start.I also plan to use AI to help me, but I'm wary of delegating all the work to it. I'm afraid that since my knowledge is limited, I might make mistakes that I won't even notice.Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm a teacher and I'm also married (mid-twenties) but I feel like I lack the discipline to learn programming, which saddens me since it's something I'm very passionate about ~~and every day I procrastinate hits me like a rock~~.I'm learning by myself by reading books and writing everything I understood down and explaining to myself what I understood. What I don't understand I ask AI to explain to me in other words, or as if it were to a child *(works like a charm)*. These are very useful for myself since it's how I learn best, but I wanted to know how others learned this skill. So, how did you learn / are learning programming? What do you do to keep disciplined? How has your journey been ever since you started? >!*Non-Important Information: I'm learning C# and just recently got to Methods, Parameters, Return Values, etc. My goal is to understand the basics of programming to only then start actually making a game. I'm also aware of the other parts of Game Dev such as art and sound design, but that's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it.* !<",

The delete function was made in such a way that it got rid of all entries that matched its parameters but just the one you want to get rid of here's the code: d.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {let p = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"list\")) || \\[\\];/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////p = p.filter((t) => t !== current);//localStorage.setItem(\"list\", JSON.stringify(p));//console.log(\"localstorage when delete: \", localStorage);//list.removeChild(li);//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////i tried to fix the flaw but i was too tired to make it work. Fast forward the next day and i was in the bathroom contemplating when an algorithm came to me. i went to my computer wrote it down and it worked!. heres the code: p.forEach((t) => t == current);p.pop(current);localStorage.setItem(\"list\", JSON.stringify(p));console.log(\"localstorage when delete: \", localStorage);list.removeChild(li);",

I've researched as best I can, eaten up tutorials and free resources and even yr vids. I practice in vs code and use github for projects and spare codes. But I feel overwhelmed and a little lost.Im trying not to make it abou5 getting a job ( career change, currently unemployed and desperate) But it's difficult due to how inter3sted i am.Ill get these days that I hyperfocus and jsut go down the rabbit hole and what I end up with it.... a mess tbh.My question is - do any long term programmers/endgineers/web devs have legit, concrete advice that worked for them when learning?I don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>) But I honestly feel like I need a direction.Mi first goal is to build a personal website as a holding place for my tentative projects, amateur blog of my learning process and what has helped me, and maybe a few scattered real like things in there too. I also plan to add in a section for gaming suggestions such as custom content, add-ons, guides etcAs well as a resources of various thingsIt's all a long term goal. Im attempting to learn basic vanilla html,css, and javascript first before delving deep into any frameworks I like to have a basic understanding of beat practices and why's first. But again... ADHD messing with my brain. Overwhelmed. Jittery. Want to do ALL THE THINGS AT ONCE.So... does anyone have ANG suggestion of how to begin this hefty project and maybe break it down into easily digestible pieces???Id so appreciate it you have NO idea.EDIT - UPDATE:: Thank you everyone so much for the honesty and helpful advice. It feels great to have people with far far more experience reach out and give tips. I seriously appreciate it. Especially considering when I made this post, I did it during an adhd spiral. I get far too honest and far too chatty without even considering the ramifications later. So I very much appreciate everyone's reply. I will be taking notes and keeping them all in mind! It definitely helps me put things into perspective and helps me figure out how and where to start with my own projects.",

One of the first reasons against it that came to mind is that it would be more difficult to determine if text data is actually text data or not, because text digits are represented in memory as their numerical values.However, isn't most data in computers stored as binary anyway? And it's really just a matter of what format and data type \"lens\" you want to view the data as?Having the characters 0-9 be their digit counterparts would make it easier to convert from text to numbers (granted, it isn't really that much harder now, because you just have to subtract a fixed offset from the character).Another reason I think they didn't take this route is that they wanted the NULL character to be represented by 0, which would slightly ruin the \"0-9 chars as 0-9 digits\" format, but couldn't they still make it work for 1-9?It really does just feel kind of non-intuitive to me why they chose to have digit characters not represented by their digits. What am I missing?Anyway, I'm excited to read your answers, and thanks in advance!",

Today I had the idea of starting to code and man was it exhausting .. so many videos telling you this and that, I lost myself in this rabbit hole of never ending information and doubts that came along the way. I planned to pick a language but even that was kind of a hassle (at first). I don't even know which part of tech I want to get into, so is the language I will pick useful in most fields? Shouldn't I know what I want to do when it comes to working in a field before picking a language? Is it even viable to learn coding with the rise of A.I and the never-ending development? Does this path have a future? So much time wasted on contemplating on things that are so far away without even knowing anything beyond \"hello world\". I came to the conclusion that it's best to at least start ANYWHERE and that I am going to learn Python. And now that I've gotten a taste of tutorial hell, I'm hoping that I know what approaches to avoid tomorrow.

Are there any videos or classes anywhere that have more of a vocabulary-based guide perhaps? I tend to visualize the spelling of words when spoken to me, so I think it can work. For example I imagine the audio would say something like: if you want to start a new paragraph, then you would type “less than symbol, P, and then greater then symbol” So it would be extremely annoying to learn visually for those of us wanting to learn via typing alongside the teacher. But for those rare few of us who’d like to get the ball rolling during a mind-numbing, dead end job by listening, it could be quite useful.",

Yet the comment above this `if` is the opposite. 2) The last line doesn't make sense when walking through an example. Let's say the buffer is of size 8, with the write pointer at 2 and the read pointer at 5, so it looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/C3Q6hHIthis would mean write - read is -3, so that if statement would be false. The function would then return `size - write + read` which would be `8 - 2 + 5` ==> `11`. This does *not* seem right.

        "content": "Hi! I’m working on an algorithms assignment (range maximum on a static array) and I’m stuck on the exact method/indexing.**Task (as I understand it)*** We have an array `a[1..n]`.* Build a complete binary tree over `a` where each internal node stores the max of its two children.* The tree is stored in an array (1-indexed). `h` is the index of the **first leaf**, so leaves occupy `[h .. 2h-1]`. (Pad with sentinels if `n` isn’t a power of two.)* Implement `maxInInterval(a, left, right)` that returns the **index in `a`** of the maximum element on the inclusive interval `[left, right]`.**My understanding / attempt*** Map endpoints to leaves: `i = h + left - 1`, `j = h + right - 1`.* While `i <= j`, if `i` is a right child, consider node `i` and move `i++`; if `j` is a left child, consider node `j` and move `j--`; then climb: `i //= 2`, `j //= 2`. Track the best max and its original array index.* Expected time: `O(log n)`.**What I’m unsure about**1. Is the “sweep inwards + climb” approach above the correct way to query with leaves at `[h..2h-1]`?2. When returning the **index in `a`**, what’s the standard way to preserve it while climbing? Store `(maxValue, argmaxIndex)` in every node?3. Are `[left, right]` both inclusive? (The spec says “interval” but doesn’t spell it out.)4. Edge cases: `left == right`, `left=1`, `right=n`, and non-power-of-two `n` (padding strategy).5. Proof sketch: is there a clean invariant to argue we visit at most `O(log n)` disjoint nodes that exactly cover `[left, right]`?**Tiny example**Suppose `a = [3, 1, 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 0]`, so `n=8` and we can take `h=8`. Leaves are `t[8..15] = a[1..8]`. For `left=3, right=6` the answer should be index `5` (value `9`).If anyone can confirm/correct this approach (or share concise pseudocode that matches the “leaves start at `h`” convention), I’d really appreciate it. Also happy to hear about cleaner ways to carry the original index up the tree. Thanks!",

It gave me a clearer sense of how data flow, caching, and queue systems fit together.I’m curious! Does anyone here tried building small learning projects using managed data platforms (Aiven, Supabase, Neon, etc.) instead of setting up everything locally?

Backend, on the other hand, has always felt a bit boring to me; I write code, but I don’t see the result right away, the process feels tedious, and I lose motivation.Just doing frontend alone doesn’t feel fun enough. If nothing happens when I click a button, I can’t enjoy it and my motivation drops. Unless there’s some action involved a working system, data, and interaction frontend by itself isn’t enough for me.I’m now in my last year of high school, and I don’t know what to do for my career. I have a few project ideas in mind, but they’re either too big or don’t seem feasible. My backend knowledge isn’t sufficient either. That’s why sometimes I think about getting help from AI, but I also feel afraid. If I rely too much on AI, I won’t learn on my own, I won’t be able to fix errors, and I won’t be able to build a solid code structure.In short, I love frontend, but it’s not enough on its own. The projects I want to build are big and complex, so I need backend knowledge but attempting big projects without learning it is hard. Amid this uncertainty, I don’t know how to move forward.Also, I struggle when preparing projects; I can’t plan questions like “where should I start?” very well.",

Programming feels so foreign it feels diff than with math where there are formulas and if you follow the method you’ll get the answer. I feel like i just get confused how you have to be so precise abt writing the code a certain way to get a desired output but even so there are still different ways to write it. Also, the fact that there are just so many aspects like functions, classes, references, pointers and trying to understand it is hard let alone writing the code from scratch. Looking at example code and figuring out the output is hard already, i find it even harder to write from scratch it feels so tedious and then im struggling to remember what these other things mean. Also, my class expects some type of prior knowledge but i’ve finally understood functions and we’re moving onto pointers, references, and classes so fast.

        "author": "Ssingleaspringle",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I know that standard C types (long, unsigned long etc.) do not strictly define the size of memory allocated for a variable - the size may differ between platforms. For example x86_64 architecture on Linux uses 8 bytes for variables of type long and 32-bit ARM processors use 4 bytes for the same type (long). The solution for that problem would be to use fixed-width variable types like uint32_t. This part is quite self-explainatory: we can use fixed-width variable types for cross-platform portability.   But I don't quite understand how one should approach numeric literals in C. Let's say I assign a value like this: uint32_t x = 5; Many guides encourage and stress the use of type suffixes stating that I should write uint32_t x = 5LU to ensure the correct type of the assigned literal. LU stands for unsigned long. The part with unsigned kinda makes sense, but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place. A well-known case where this may cause problems is when performing binary operations on values like this.printf(\"%zu, sizeof(1L));printf(\"%ld, 1L << 31);The result (the same code compiled and run on x86_64 Linux and 32-bit ARM CPU) proves that this is a real problem and the usage of suffixes is not portable across platforms at all.ARM result: 4 -2147483648Linux result: 8 2147483648So my question is: how do you guys approach this problem? I've seen alternatives like using macros UINT32_C(5); or staight up casting (uint32_t) 5; but they also seem to have their own problems. The most common style I see is using suffixes. Programming teams also seem to not care that much (I get it - it's an additional 8 characters per variable declaration :face_with_tongue:) until it becomes a problem.",

I instantly loved it , it felt meaningful, impactful, and technically interesting. So I jumped in, did a good bit of research, and started thinking about how I could make it my own.At first, my plan was to:* Build a basic sign language recognition system using a webcam, Python, and OpenCV.* Expand the word library beyond the typical 10-20 signs.* Focus specifically on Irish Sign Language (ISL) to localize it more.But as I kept researching, I realized I might’ve been on the wrong side of the internet early on, because it turns out that projects like this have already been done a *lot*. My additions (more words, ISL focus) don’t really feel like enough to count as a real advancement or innovation, especially for a final year project.I then thought: what if I added a region detection feature? Something that could detect which sign language dialect is being used (e.g., ASL vs BSL vs ISL). But again, the more I dig, the more I see that similar ideas have been explored — and I'm starting to feel like I’m just re-inventing existing wheels without offering anything new.To be honest, I’m really stuck now, I’ve backed myself into a project that’s been done too many times already, and I’m not sure how to meaningfully innovate it.I would love some advice on this, what more can i add, and should i just give up. If you guys have any other ideas i could do instead, that would be amazing.Thank you",

I started learning, then I started reading that Python is much slower comparing to other languages (As I read, Python reads line by line, meanwhile Java reads everything at once or something like that, fix me if I’m wrong). The thing is, I was talking to my friend, who works in a place, where programming is needed and he said that I should add Java or C# to my portfolio after I’m done with python, because Python is not that effective anymore. Do you have any tips on how should I continue? I’m learning through SoloLearn, which has helped me lots and offers more languages. Appreciate any help!!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, could use some advice or help as I'm stuck in a crazy situation.Last week, I left my role as an Engineer at a big tech company and moved from my home country to San Francisco to join a small AI startup. I started work last week, and everything seemed to be going great, I was onboarding smoothly and was getting great vibes all around from the people and the team. In a huge turn of events, on my 2nd day, they suddenly told me they no longer needed me and ended my employment, no negotiations. It was completely unexpected and I am still in shock. I had barely settled in and was still getting used to the new environment. It felt like they were never serious about hiring me from the start considering I could just get let go randomly on my 2nd day, but it's also extremely unfair to me having quit my job at big tech and leaving my friends and family to move across the world to work for them. Has anyone had such an experience before before? Is this a common thing among AI startups right now where hiring-and-firing is just part of the culture?Anyhow, I am now stuck in San Francisco alone with a 60-day window to find a new job before my visa runs out. If anyone has any advice on how to get through this period, or could refer me to any opportunities in backend, AI, ML, or infrastructure engineering roles in the Bay Area, it would mean everything to me. I have experience as a backend engineer working on large-scale AI/ML infrastructure at big tech, and also full-stack development across smaller companies. I'm open to any types of companies at this point and will put in my best work wherever I end up next.P.S. Some people are accusing this post of not being real, or sounds fake. It absolutely happened. I understand why doubts are being casted, and I do agree we should not trust everything on the internet, but on the flip side, I do need some room for anonymity as well, considering this post has already been seen by 73k users. All I know is my life has been flipped upside down and I'm looking for advice/help with referrals on getting out of this situation. Any advice/help could be absolutely life-changing for me.",

        "content": "[https://imgur.com/a/K96VYOd](https://imgur.com/a/K96VYOd)FRED data shows that software development job postings increased post-pandemic (due to low federal funds rate and quantitative easing by the Fed) and reached at peak in early 2022. At this time, the Fed finally decided to reverse their take on inflation being only transitory, and began their first rate hike to begin cooling the economy in an attempt to suppress rising inflation. Corporations responded to this shift in monetary policy and began immediately reducing their hiring and thus job postings. Over the course of the year, SWE job postings fell rapidly.In November of 2022, ChatGPT was widely released. Following that, other models by other companies were widely released. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following ChatGPTs release. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following other model releases. In fact, the declining rate of job postings slowed as the Fed reduce their rate of interest rate hikes. The number of SWE job postings is not materially different now than it was the day that CoPilot and Gemini released.I am asserting that the CS job market today is almost entirely a product of the normal labor market effects during a Federal Funds Interest Rate hike cycle. The layoffs we see today are still a hold over from the massive hiring effort made post-pandemic compounded by corporations now being squeezed due to comparatively speaking high interest rates.Largely, not completely, any company that conducts layoffs citing AI are doing so as a PR play as it makes it sound as though they are able to the same work with less overhead and are expertly adopting this new technology, when in reality they are just responding to the squeeze. Any job seeker unable to find a job and citing reasons due to AI are doing so because it protects their ego or they are uninformed about the greater monetary policy and labor market effects at play.",

I've been working at a FAANG for a bit over eight years, and got promoted to Senior around three years ago.I recently went on a job search, and things went very well for me. I spent several months (April to July) preparing, did a bunch of mock interviews, solved hundreds of LeetCode questions, etc. That dedicated prep was absolutely vital. While my experience helped me get interviews, the prep work was what allowed me to pass interviews. If I had just started applying without putting the prep work in, I probably would have gotten around the same number of responses, but I would not have been nearly as successful once I got to the interviews themselves. I applied to most of these companies over the last week of July, and ultimately signed a deal with a household name tech company as a Staff Engineer in early October.I really feel for all the new grads out there - when I was applying, I quickly realized I didn't need to filter the job listings by experience, because basically every company had almost exclusively Senior and above roles - there were barely any new grad or even just early career listings that I could see. It definitely looks like it's a tough market for new engineers, but (in my experience, which isn't saying it'll be true for everyone) the market for Senior and Staff seems relatively robust.Happy to answer any questions. I also answered some questions about my experience in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1o38ecf/comment/nitin7d/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1o38ecf/comment/nitin7d/)",

I’m eager to switch to a better role eventually, but I can’t help but think this race is never going to end. 100k is above average, yet I feel like I’m penny pinching.

I have heavy quantitative and statistics exposure, and I’m eager to go fully into trading in order to make it. I just don’t see any other route to a comfortable life. All the big success stories you hear are mostly just luck, being in the right company at the right time and getting the right TC. You can’t rely on being an outlier to guarantee success.

I've actively been trying to recruit some old out-of-work coworkers to this role at a FAANG over the past few months and if they aren't just opposed to part-time RTO their response is almost a universal \"I'd be open to a developer role.\" I don't really understand this philosophy for the people who are acting like AI killed their career or are otherwise frantically job hunting. To me the writing is on the wall: these roles seem to be replacing \"full stack\" developer roles in a lot of companies. The scope of \"full stack\" has changed significantly over the last several years and the way that the hyperscalers and big business alike are operating if your skills don't cross over into cloud/infra management you're simply not going to be able to meet their needs for a high paying role anymore. The only exceptions to that of course seem to be ML engineers or the work that rides even closer to the hardware than the SRE role demands. I've said this many times before, AI isn't killing the CS industry, but it is definitely reshaping it.Edit: I'm not offering referrals to strangers. Modern AI chat bots can review your resume and offer solid advice on filling knowledge gaps for these roles.",

        "author": "Moneymoneymoney1122",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got laid off from my role at a financial services company back in March 2025, right when the market started falling apart. It's been 7 months now of sending out hundreds of applications, and honestly I'm starting to feel pretty lost about what I should even be doing at this point.I graduated with my CS degree in 2023 and spent about 2 years working as an Application Engineer at a major financial company. My day-to-day was mainly building AWS Lambda functions and Glue jobs in Python to handle data integrations - stuff like pulling Bloomberg PORT data into AWS Athena so fund managers could do risk analysis. I also developed SQL queries and workflows to migrate derivatives and fund data between our internal databases and external platforms like MSCI. I was maintaining and monitoring about 5 enterprise ETL processes that ran daily, handling gigabytes of financial data, and I spent a lot of time on production incident resolution.My tech stack was mainly Python, AWS, SQL with PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, Pandas, NumPy, and some Tableau. So I wasn't doing pure software development - it was more data engineering and integration focused work.Here's where I'm struggling. I do get some responses to applications - not many, but a few here and there. The problem is when I actually get to the interview stage, I'm struggling badly. I've gotten really rusty after 7 months out of the field, and interviewers dive way deeper into technical concepts than I expect. Things I used to know well - AWS integrations, ETL architecture, even some Python specifics - are getting fuzzy. I can talk about what I did at a high level, but when they start asking detailed technical questions or want me to architect something on the spot, I'm just not sharp anymore. It's like I know I used to understand this stuff, but I can't access it quickly enough in the moment.On top of that, I genuinely don't know what jobs I should even be targeting with my background. My title was \"Application Engineer\" but the work was really data engineering and integration heavy. Should I be going for Data Engineer roles? Backend Engineer? DevOps or Platform Engineer positions? Cloud Engineer roles? I honestly don't know anymore, and I think I might be applying to the wrong types of positions entirely, which is why the interviews feel so mismatched when I do get them.I'm also struggling with how to describe what I actually did. When I write \"data integration\" and \"ETL maintenance\" on my resume, it sounds way less impressive than the work actually was, but I don't know how to articulate the complexity without sounding like I'm overselling it. And the market being brutal right now isn't helping - I know 2025 has been terrible for everyone, but getting through interviews when I'm this rusty is becoming impossible.I'm at the point where I'm considering a few different paths but I'm not sure which makes sense. Maybe I should take some time to rebuild my skills systematically before continuing to interview, possibly through grad courses or something structured. Maybe I should pivot to a different type of role that's easier to break into right now. Or maybe I just need to figure out how to prep better for these deep technical interviews. Honestly, I don't know anymore.So I guess my questions for this community are: Based on the experience I described, what job titles and roles should I actually be targeting? I feel like I'm applying to positions that don't quite match my background and that's showing up in interviews. How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field? What's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews? Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?The problem is I'm bombing them because I'm not technically sharp anymore. I need tactical guidance on whether I should pause and rebuild skills first, or if there's a way to prep more effectively for these deep technical conversations. Any honest feedback would be really appreciated because I'm genuinely lost here.",

Tell me what you wanna see, and I can make it happenBut I've been in senior roles for a while and it doesn't really feel like I *ever* use my technical abilities anymore. Often, I feel actively held back from doing so. Like I could easily fix a bug, but there's often tons of overhead and planning that make it not really worth doing. I spend most of my time fighting with people over things that really don't matter, trying to decode a bunch of corporate jargon, and trying to navigate navigate corporate politicsI feel like I've never doubted my ability to deliver on anything that anyone wants in my domain (frontend), it's usually just an oddly bureaucratic set of hoops to jump through to get even the most basic things done. 90% of time is just spent communicating to higher ups, and only a minuscule fraction of time is available for coding. I kind of understand now why people study for leetcode, at this level, it feels like there's nothing to actually code anymoreI was let go and decided to work a bit on a personal project cause I was bored. I was working on a component library before I was let go and had some ideas I wanted to try. So, I spun up my own and within literally 4 hours, I had most of the library done. At work, it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped. I also for once enjoyed making something and felt really proud of the result. Just seemed so different than workAnd FYI the last place I worked that was the *most* corporate was a small startup that seemed to fancy themselves a \"developer first\" company and tried to minimize on managementIs this a common experience?

MBA in IT Management - I’m interested in becoming an engineering manager eventually, but I don’t know how much a specialization like this actually matters for that.4. General MBA - The broadest option. If specialization doesn’t matter much, maybe this is better? Could also hedge for a career pivot (not planning one, but never hurts).5. None - Maybe all of these are just a waste of time, energy, and opportunity cost :'(Has anyone here gone through one of these paths or similar? Did it actually help your career or comp long-term? Would love some real-world perspective from people who’ve been there. Thanks!",

        "content": "I got an offer for a mid level developer role (same as my current role) via the only way you can find a new job in this market, aka a referral. Passed their tech interview and I got an offer, but the main hangup is the salary. They will likely not offer me any more than I'm already making. So I'm weighing between my current 2 choices, with their own pros and cons. Company A (Current company)- Currently making $115k. They've been decent about raises so far, so I'd expect to reach 120-125 within a year. - Java + spring backend, angular frontend. We're a big company, so we have a lot of structure and systems setup. Docker + kubernetes, deployment pipelines, etc. I prefer this stack since it seems like most companies in my area use java + spring. - I like my current team and manager. No conflicts, we get along well, and my manager is a tech guy so he understands what I do and how to support me. - Benefits are pretty great, huge 401k match and a lot of PTO. - The main downside is it's 5 days in office. Yeah, it sucks. It's a 30 min commute so it's not as bad as some others, but it's not great when we used to be 2 days in office before. This is the reason I'm looking elsewhere. Company B (Who sent the offer)- .NET/C# backend, React frontend, and a lot of SQL (we don't use SQL at company A). Mostly Microsoft based tech stack. - Would probably offer me 115k, but unlikely to see raises afterwards. - 4 days remote, 1 day in office, and the office is 5 minutes away. This is by far the biggest benefit. - The team seems good, but they're super small. They're down to 2 devs, the tech lead and another mid level developer. No indication on if they'll hire more. - They're not a startup, but they're midsized. Not as structured as company A, but also nowhere near the same amount of red tape. What would you do in my position?",

        "content": "This summer, I landed an internship at a company I’d always dreamed about. At the start, everything felt perfect the team was friendly, people would talk and engage. But as the weeks went by, I started seeing the reality. My mentor never seemed interested in genuinely solving my problems. Whenever I’d share updates or ask for help, she’d just avoid it or brush things off with random things. Major issues in my project were ignored by her, even though the entire team, including the manager, knew about these blockers. Because of this, I lost 3–4 weeks struggling with blockers while no one actually helped.Honestly, my communication wasn’t the best since this was my first job. I thought putting in hard work would be enough, but I soon realised it’s more about networking and “being seen.” Even so, I completed my project completely from start to finish, pushing thousands of lines of code in the last five days before my internship ended.After all that effort, I didn’t get a return offer. The HR gave me random feedback which wasn’t even related to my actual work. It was clear my mentor and manager had already made up their minds. She never gave me any feedback during the entire internship. Even after it ended, I reached out to her, but she just ignored my message. She’s only skilled at looking good in front of upper management.This whole experience has taken a major mental toll on me. Even now, months after rejection, I feel like a failure. Every time I open LeetCode or even see job openings from that company on LinkedIn, it messes with my mind. Most interns got converted to full-time, even those who barely worked meanwhile, I did everything right and still got left behind. I’d be labelled as a failure in front of other interns, the team, and even networks within the company man.Although I did get another offer, working at that company was my dream. That dream was completely destroyed because of these people. Whenever I try to talk about it, people just give me sympathy and say, “You’ll get better opportunities.” But they don’t realise life doesn’t throw big opportunities every day. It hurts even more because of how things turned out there. Sometimes I wish I had never interned at that place.",

They're not looking to become a psychologist, but something in Human Resources and an Administrative Assistant.Their resume consists of just small jobs done throughout community college and university. It's valuable experience for sure, but definitely not as competitive as a traditional SWE internship. The jobs she's applying to are here in California around LA and the Bay Area so HCOL and VHCOL so they're going to pay higher than average, but she's actively hearing back from jobs that pay 80k, 90k, some around 110k for ENTRY level roles that require or recommend 1-2 years of experience. Some part-time positions that pay $32/hr which is actually a lot more than my helpdesk job. Oh, and they don't need to study for 5 rounds of interviews.I'm so happy for them, but I feel like I'm going crazy.

        "content": "I just can't do another toxic company honestly. I've had three in a row. I've started self-reflecting and trying to figure out how I keep ending up in them and how to avoid them in the future. Here's a few key things I thought of:1. if a company has a non disparagement clause in their *employment* contract, they are probably not a good place to bother with. It means that you won't be able to find \"real\" data online so it's just a shot in the dark2. Ask companies about their reviews, especially negative ones. At the worst company I worked at, I brought up a negative review. The CTO basically went \"oh, just a bunch of dumb disgruntled employees, I don't know what their problem was\". Suffice it to say, I now certainly know what their problem was, and I think they were quite justified in their opinion3. Companies under 100 employees are deeply unstable and promoting a single person can make everyone's life a fucking nightmare4. Use ChatGPT deep research for company sentiment. I would also recommend you ask it to break it down by year, saying how the company culture has evolved. I just did it for one company I worked at that I said I disliked, and it was literally 100% correct5. Do what you can to check for cult-like behavior. For example, if you're going to an AI company and they're ranting about how AGI is coming next year just trust me bro, run as fast as you canJust wondering if you guys have any other tips?",

Thousands of applications and only a small handful of interviews / calls have gone nowhere so they have amounted to a total waste of time. I'm applying all over the place, for pretty much anything remotely CS related I have most of the experience for so it's not like I only look for remote stuff or $100k+ stuff (in fact I don't even apply to positions that pay that much anymore because I know their standards are too high for me to meet). I have more personal projects that aren't on my resume but they are not really something that I can put on my resume as they don't generate money, aren't complete projects and have no users and aren't particularly impressive in any way, so in effect I am not doing anything at all every day.[worse resume link](https://imgur.com/a/eUrbC84)Here's a version of my resume where I removed the non programming stuff, the imperfect GPA, the irrelevant degree, the skills not related to positions on the resume as well as the video game projects as they probably don't count as real projects. To me it just looks even worse in every way and there is zero chance I can get hired with it? Does this mean I am unhireable? It looks like I didn't get anything for the past few years and thus I am a terrible employee that nobody should ever hire. There's also way too much white space because there is nothing more to say about each position that isn't just restating the same things over and over or saying extremely basic stuff (like they don't need to know the exact random libraries I used and it probably would look bad on me for talking about those? I also heard that me talking about something as basic as ajax requests is also bad?)[more complete resume link](https://imgur.com/a/iaYDKYg)Even with the more complete resume it still feels very terrible in terms of me competing with other people (I feel like maybe the bar for entry level is having several years of highly relevant non internship experience which I'm never going to get if I don't get a job). Adding in the skills for each position also breaks it when I put it into Workday so I have to get rid of them? It doesn't matter if it looks better to a human recruiter if the system parses it so badly I get trashed immediately so I should remove them?I just don't know at all what I should be doing to get a job? I haven't been working on \"real\" projects because I don't know how to make those (a project isn't real unless it's generating money and/or has a ton of users?). I know there is a definitive thing I should be doing but I don't know what it is? No amount of \"just do it\" is going to help me find that correct answer, I can't \"just make a game\" like my parents want because that is something that requires years of (non programming) work to make something profitable, and even then companies don't even see video game projects as real projects so all that effort would not help me even slightly?",

I graduated in May and have been fortunate enough to get a software engineering job at a small start up and have been learning a lot the last three months. I didn't use AI for coding at all in college, which seems to be uncommon since it came out a couple months into my freshman year, but I cared too much about learning things for myself and the satisfaction of coding to bother with it much. When I started my job, our lead/senior dev encouraged using AI to speed up processes and handle some tedious tasks. I've been using ChatGPT for writing unit tests, doing more difficult research and bug finding, etc. which are things that I was asked to do to speed things up. I am cool with using it as a tool to augment my programming and I'm sure it does speed things up. Recently, they've had me install Cursor, which again, I admit is cool and it works, but what the hell is the point of being a software engineer with this? I'm told I still need to know what I am doing, still need to do research into what libraries and patterns to use, review the generated code, etc. but I'm starting feeling like I entered this field too late to actually be a programmer if this is the new expectation. I don't want to push back on using Cursor, but I want to be writing my own code. I don't want to fall behind in efficiency when the other two engineers are heavily using Cursor, but I don't want to lose the skill of coding and problem solving for myself. Is there some balance that I can strike, or do I just need to cope with AI taking the joy and satisfaction out of this job? I would seriously appreciate any advice or insight, or even to hear other people are also struggling with this sort of thing.",

        "content": "For context, I attend a T50 school in the US in my locality, in a major East Coast metro area, and am double-majoring in CS and DS. Some roles I've been applying to include the usual Software Engineer / Developer roles of all stacks, Data Scientist, Data Analyst and the few database-specific roles that pop up, and even QA, Business Analyst, and various IT roles (that I'm probably woefully unqualified for anyways since I have 0 IT experience).Let's say the absolute worst happens, and no company hires me for any role between now and my graduation this coming May. In that case, I'd be forced to either become a NEET (and maybe even officially register for some form of unemployment), or (slightly less undesirably) end up in some retail or service job - something that doesn't require a CS degree - just to have *some* work.**What's the likelihood I'd end up in this situation? And if I do, what's the likelihood I'd ever be able to escape?**Now obviously, that's a pretty terrible fate to end up in long-term. So I think I'd need some form of \"game plan\". I've already worked some of these before as a student, and some of my older coworkers there have been \"failed\" students in non-CS STEM fields.And since I wouldn't want to work there forever, I'd likely still be applying to \"real\" jobs on the side, and maybe even landing a few interviews if I'm fortunate, but things might not improve, and could even worsen. This current \"employer's market\" might last for a while (I heard for civil engineering it took nearly an entire decade), and unfortunately, it's possible my skills and degree could risk atrophying in the meantime. And this could kill my motivation to do LeetCode / side projects, etc.And what the hell are you even supposed to tell the hiring team if you do get an interview for a tech position? \"I couldn't find work out of college so I had to work at the local grocery store / restaurant\"? How are you going to convince the hiring managers to consider you over some other cracked junior who has *not* needed to resort to menial labor in order to make ends meet or prevent a career gap?At what point should I simply admit defeat? At what point do I seriously consider reskilling into non-tech roles? (I'm already having trouble with even \"adjacent\" roles like DA and BA.) Which non-tech roles, even? I don't think I'd be able to break into law, medicine, nursing, or most trades, and even if I could, I don't think I'd have the requisite interest.For the sake of discussion, my definition of \"winning\" would be to have enough money to move out of my parents' house in the suburbs and rent an apartment somewhere major enough for me to have a satisfactory social and romantic life. Doesn't have to be 6 figs, FAANG, or even a SWE role at all. Don't even have to actually do it, just have to *make enough money to do it*, and if the job is really local I could just spend ~1-2 extra years at home and save the earnings to be frugal.You cannot do this by stocking shelves or flipping burgers for $15/hour. And if I'm forced to care for ailing parents on that salary while their home - the home I grew up in - goes to rot, then oh boy, things are *not* going to be pretty.",

Counting internships, I have about 1.5 years of total experience (without internships, I only have 3 months). I graduated with a masters degree in December 2023 (only coursework, no thesis) and then spent some time unemployed before finding my first role.Since entry level is only going to get more competitive, I'm thinking of doing another masters degree if I cannot find anything by the end of this year. Is this the ideal way to proceed? Right now, I'm pursuing personal projects, maintaining my Medium blog and building projects in public. Money is not an obstacle for me (in-state tuition is cheaper).While doing this will definitely buy me more time and save me from having a huge career gap, I would be making a gamble that this period will allow me to network more and get one internship that would hopefully convert to a full time offer. Also, I would need to figure out how to get updated recommendation letters, which is not going to be easy with this time gap...Has anyone gone through this similar situation and ended up going back to school?

Things are especially bad because all the entry level positions get flooded by people with experience who are obviously better than me in every way? There's also no more spring 2025 positions pretty much, like all those new grad positions don't even have an option to say I've graduated in spring 2025 outside of the \"other\" option which means my application would probably get thrown out instantly.Experience wise I am in a bad spot, I don't have very much \"real\" internship experience, the past 4 summers in college I was at a small 1 guy + random interns place where I did random hardware ish projects with PLCs. Some years I had projects where I made a mini server and made some pages with PHP and Javascript, another year I made a small app for Zoom meetings on a headset, but none of that really counts as real stuff because I don't have any real metrics for them (because I don't have any relationship with the companies my boss was making stuff for, I can't just ask them to give me months of random data for me to see exactly how much money the thing I did made?). My parents put my old resume in ChatGPT and got something that just looks so much worse to me? It ended up making those 4 summers into one thing which to me just looks like a complete lie. Background check would immediately see that I only did like 12 months instead of 4 consecutive years or even without a background check they would think I am completely lying because I can't work a full time in person internship in one city and go to college full time in person 100 miles away, that is not believable. Should I just put that lie there anyway???But that's all in the past now, I have to do something to make myself more hireable now before my qualifications drop to zero, but I just don't know what. I can't really do networking because there's basically nothing in the way of local software openings. Befriending some random in some company isn't really going to help me unless they are someone really high up, but I just don't have that kind of charisma to make myself the best friend of some hiring person to the point that I will get in instead of all the much higher qualified people out there.Project wise I am in a bad spot too. Some college classes gave me some stuff to put on there, one class had a group project where our group made a web app with React and Firebase but that doesn't really mean much as it wasn't a \"real\" project with big profit numbers and impressive metrics of any kind. I also spent a year in high school making a old game mod with assembly but that doesn't really count because assembly code is not something anyone is hiring at entry level. It has a playerbase that I estimated to be roughly 5000+ but that doesn't really count for anything because it's not a dollar value.I just can't think of a good project to do that has anything \"impressive\" or would lead to massively impressive metrics? The only real metrics they care about are dollar values? Because anything other than those aren't really \"impressive\" (it doesn't matter if you've written X lines of code or worked with a database of X size or had X users or used X different programming languages or technologies because they don't really care about that). I don't know how to turn a profit as a guy who isn't an entrepreneur, marketer or good artist. Everything out there bangs on about those stupid metrics and it just frustrates me to no end. Because I don't know how to make anything impressive at all. I can't really think of something that distinguishes \"stupid toy project\" vs \"something hiring people are impressed by\" outside of something profitable or something made specifically for that company (which is just infeasible for me to do, I can't spend months on a massive project just to apply to a single company and have those hiring people not even bother looking).I also don't really have good answers to all the STAR questions they ask? Because I never have a result that's better than \"it got done\" or something similar. Like I keep repeating in this post I don't have metrics and I don't know how to make a project that makes those metrics happen. I also don't have good answers for their other kind of questions like \"explain a time where you had a conflict with a coworker\" because I don't have experience like that (the worst that happened to the groups I was in was more like \"minor disagreement that gets resolved in 1 minute\", I just don't have a compelling story about how all the group members were arguing for hours and then I stopped it in 1 second.). I also never have a good answer for \"why do you want to work for this company\" because I don't really care about random company #1000 I've applied to, I just can't give them the answer \"I have always strived to work for this specific company and I have never applied to anything else and I will die for this company that I've only heard of when I saw the job posting\"",

I'm currently at a point where I want to leave and take some time off after working for 10+ years without any sort of extended time off. I plan to take 3-6 months to do some career reflection, ski, spend time with family/friends, and travel.I want to get some thoughts here provided the following information: 1. Financially I have roughly \\~100k in cash and another 100k in the stock market. Monthly rent is 2.5k 2. I'm initially planning to put my two weeks in mid January prior to my planned Japan Ski trip in February Timing is key here as I do need to stay for the rest of the year to qualify for bonus + 401k contribution for the fiscal year. Question to you guys is would you go with the initial plan of putting in the two weeks in mid January or continue to quiet quit until ski season is over? Financially speaking I do think I should be fine sticking to my original plan which is to put in the two weeks in January. But coming from a family where my parents were immigrants and struggling to feed two kids, I do have some PTDSD with money and it makes me a little worried. I know some individuals will point out that it's not ideal to do this in this economy, but I also know that I'm in a point of my career where if I don't take some time off now, I will never have the opportunity to do so as I currently don't have any kids. For context, I am an EM right now and will be looking for EM roles after taking time off. Let me know what you guys think. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated!",

I've always had an interest in front end development, but I also dont want to pursue a field with limited jobs. So my question is would my best move be to pursue full-stack development instead?

I was in their pipeline before, but the project was cut due to funding. Now they’re offering:* **3 months training** @ $15/hr* **Full-time role afterwards** @ $27/hr* **Relocation** to San Antonio/Dallas* **Start date** in \\~20 days* **$10k breach clause** if I leave before contract ends* They said some trainees might get cut before placement* Contract lasts 2 yearsWhat I'm basically concerned about is that this job was canceled before because of funding, and I'm scared it's going to happen again. They told me it's different this time because the contract was more stable since it's not a federal contract but it's still a massive risk to quit my current job for $27/hr. There's also the $10K breach clause which I think is a red flag. Last time, when I was in their pipeline before, they explained to me that the $10K breach clause was set because of how expensive the security clearance process was. That's fine with me, but now they're telling me that there's no need for a security clearance for this role and the breach clause is still set at $10K. I'm just curious, is there anybody that currently works with SkillStorm that can vouch for them? Is there anybody in the same boat as I am?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm in the fortunate position to have 2 job offers right now. One of which is full remote (permanently), and the other is in person 4 days a week, with a 1 day WFH policy. The remote gig would be a pretty good salary bump from my current role and has comparable benefits to my current position, which is also remote (but less time off). The in office gig would be significantly better benefits when it comes to PTO, retirement contributions, and while the base salary is the same as the other role, there is an annual discretionary bonus that I have been told averages 35-65% of your base salary (but of course... discretionary) which would make it SIGNIFICANTLY more financially desirable. I had a really great impression of the culture at both companies in my interviews, however a friend of my mentor warned her that the in office place has toxic tendencies, not from personal experience but via the grapevine from others in the same industry. This really surprised me as I felt like everyone I met was SO friendly and nice and that I would really enjoy working with them, but I don't want to fully discount his take as my mentor trusts him. That said, based on glassdoor reviews I am getting a picture that a certain side of the company is pretty toxic, however the team I'm joining has no overlap with that group. But it's hard to know where the spillover is of course. I have heard good things about the remote company's culture, but my friend who works there has told me he has some issues with upper leadership's direction (but has said he thinks those issues would exist at most companies). The remote one is more of a career advancing step into a leadership position, whereas the in office one is somewhere I would get to grow my skills and work closely with mentors to improve technically. I would definitely be locking in in either role to perform well, but with slightly different dynamics. I have about 5 years of experience, so while I think I could tackle the remote leadership opportunity, I don't feel as secure in my skillset as I might want to be in order to perform really well in such a high impact role -- so I think that role would involve a high degree of personal time spent learning off the job to make sure I could keep up. The remote role has much more flexible hours so I could continue to step out for an occasional 2pm pilates class if I felt like it, but there is an on call component where I would need to do unpaid overtime occasionally outside of core hours. On the contrary, obviously I'm not doing a workout class in the middle of the day if I take the in office role, but there is no on-call component and the interviewers I spoke with all told me they have never done any overtime and that when they close their laptops at the end of the day, that's really it, which also appeals to me as the remote boundary blurring has been a big issue in my current role as well.Both have tech stacks I see as very transferrable skills, although my mentor pointed out the remote one would have much better name recognition when it came time to job hunt next. (Another positive about the in office role is that everyone I spoke with has been there 5+ years, which seemed like a really positive sign about retention). I am honestly very tempted by the in office role, but multiple friends have told me I'm nuts for not taking the remote role and the phrase \"blinded by money\" has been used. Curious to get some more takes from people who are also working in tech on what's the right move as I do need to come to a decision this weekend.",

        "content": "I’m looking for advice on how to improve my resume and job search strategy. I recently graduated and did an internship during my program at a non-tech company. My manager verbally promised a full-time offer after graduation, so I made the mistake assuming things will work out without preparing properly. I stopped applying and didn’t polish my resume, thinking the offer was guaranteed. But after I graduated, my manager told me the company wasn’t doing well and couldn’t hire me. He asked me to wait until next year to see if things change.I started applying in August and I know it was late. I asked my college advisor to help me revise my resume, and I’ve since applied to around 300 applications. So far, I’ve only received 2 interviews and 3 OA. I’ve been grinding LeetCode and working on side projects to make my resume stronger. But I’m not sure what else I should be doing.If anyone is willing to take a look at my resume or share advice on how to improve my chances, I’d really appreciate it.Resume: [https://imgur.com/a/B0e82h7](https://imgur.com/a/B0e82h7)",

Today I handed my notice in.My line manager told me he would double my salary to get me to stay. Then immediately after asked me what number I would need to stay. I told him I would need to think about it and we agreed to talk tomorrow.I make pretty good money already so, obviously even double is a lot of money. However, I'm not a fan of the owners and feel there is little job security there. But, short term I would gain a lot of money quickly. Without lifestyle changes I could easily save/invest an extra £2000 a month.On the other side is the defence company and the stability that brings. I get to work on cool stuff and have a solid engineering company on my cv. It's much more of a long term investment, however, my salary remains the same (with some great benefits) but my rent essentially doubles and cost of living also increases because I have to relocate for it.So, boil it down to big money at a start up that's pretty much run on vibes and feelings or less money at a big corp but a much more solid career track?",

        "author": "LiveMathematician892",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I keep getting an excellent feedback about my technical ability, yet, I get shit about my soft skills. The thing is, they won't tell what's the actual problem. All I hear are \"oh, you don't like small talk much\" or \"You're rude and not diplomatic enough\".How I would describe myself:1) I indeed don't like small talk, I know more or less how it works, I just find it annoying and sort of pointless. I know that's how you can create a relationship and such... But I see those guys, at best, 2 times within a year when the team gets of remote, why would anyone care about that? I'm, like all of them, there for the money and thats that... It will read \"machiavelistic\", assholish or something like that but for the last decade give or take the only relationships I built, or tried to build, was with people where I saw something that I could gain from. It was either people who were smarter than me, people with connections or information that I wanted (although sometimes I think there was misjudgement and I was thinking about getting laid, or at best it was connection of both). This kind of worked and let me get my foot in the door, despite many shortcoming on my end at the time. The issue is, these people are out of the picture, atm way too often I do feel like I'm the smartest person in the room, or, at the very least, knowing the smarter person won't get me anywhere, feel like it's just a matter of a workplace. It ain't Google, Microsoft or anything of the kind, its just some run of the mill company pushing out overengineered, slow, unmaintainable code. Wasnt it for the bad market and my decent pay (Ill have hard time finding a job where Ill get a payrise significant enough to risk a job change in this market. These people won't get me anywhere other than up the ladder in the company, but even so, I rarely get to interact with people other than a lead of my project whos a bit of a pushover. I mean, I don't see any other solution to the issue than reprogamming myself (how???) to attempt building relationships with anyone, not just someone I want to bang or where I feel like there is a clear benefit to gain from them. Only person that I feel like I really somewhat connected at the firm is a tester designated to my project who hates and trashtalks it about as much as I do, that made us have something in common...2) I'm the kind of guy that leaves a lot of comments under PRs. I get a cred for it, at the very least from upper management. It's not about the extra spaces or formatting, although at extreme cases I'll point that out, I just hate mess or the \"iterative development\" where lack of code review lets very obvious bugs get to the repo, hinder development and generate more work (more PRs). Most people at my company don't do the review, but were getting back to 1) here - most people at my firm are just bad/very average devs (or at the very least lack ambition or are burned out).3) I tend to be \"judgemental\" or \"rude\". This is coming from me sometimes pointing out someone did a poor job (overengineer a feature, create a poorly worded ticket etc.) without beating around the bush. The thing is, I'm not completely f-ed in the head, I don't do that from day one, the frustation really needs to reach the boiling point where the same thing happens a number of times. But you know what sucks about it, that I give a shit about being \"rude\" or \"judgemental\"? When I tried being nice, giving \"constructive criticism\" at retros, vaguely pointing out things that could be improved... Nothing f happened. You know the routine, theres action point, theres fake action to handle it, then maybe there is a call on what to do, and then somewhat checks the issue as resolved and we move on. Only by expressing my frustation over a longer period, so it was finally escalated to a person that gives a damn, my points that I gave several figureheads finally started to be taken seriously, I made an impact. At the end of the day, the person that matters, sees it as a double edged sword (or something like that) - this dude cares about this project and this company, but hes a douchebag/cant get his point across via diplomatic means.TLDR: I dont know how to force myself to small talk / building relationships that I find \"pointless\" i.e. without easy to spot value and don't know how to communicate issues/suggest improvements (it feels like at my current firm I need to break the chain of command and go the highest person immediately)",

My question is, can I do that outside of my actual work? In other words is it possible to get (hire-able) working knowledge & skills of these technologies through independent side projects, self-study & certifications supplemented with only SRE work experience (mainly dealing with observability, load testing, launch readiness testing, DR, etc).On one hand I know I had these exact concerns when I first pivoted, but I feel like having junior level expectations was very different.",
