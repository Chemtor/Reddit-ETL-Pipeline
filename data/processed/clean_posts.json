        "author": "soosmagmangos",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi guys! :) I hope it's the right place for this question.So I have a databases and webtechnolgies exam on thursday and it's freaking me out. This is the first and probably last time I'm in touch with databases since it has absolutely nothing to do with my degree but I have to take this exam anyway. So you're taking to a noob :/I've been having my issues with normalization. I get the concept, I also kind of get what I'm supposed to do and somehow I manage to do it correctly. But I just don't understand and it freaks me out that I can normalize but don't know what I'm doing at the same time. So the first normal form (english is not my mother tongue so ig thats what you'd call it in english) is to check every attribute of a table for atomicity. So I make another columns and so on. I get this one, it's easy. I think I have to do it so I avoid that there aren't many values? That's where it begins, I don't even know what one, I just do it and it's correct. Then I go on and check for the second normal form. It has something to do with dependencies and keys. At this point I check the table and something in me says \"yeah girl, looks logical, do it\" and I make a second or third table so attributes that work together are in one table. Same problem, I don't know why I do it. And this is also where the struggle begins. I don't even know what I'm doing, I'm just doing it right, but I'm never doing it because I know. But it gets horrible with the third normal form. Transitive dependencies??? I don't even know what that exactly means. At this point I feel like I have to make my tables smaller and smaller and look for the minimal amount of attributes that need to be together to make sense. And I kind of get these right too ¡-¡ But I have make the most mistakes in the third form. But the worst is this one way of spelling my professor uses sometimes. Something like A -> B, B -> CD or whatever. It describes my tables and also dependencies? But I really don't get this one. We also have exercises where this spelling is the only thing given and I have to normalize only with that. I need my tables to manage this. Maybe you understand what I don't understand? I don't know why I exactly do it and I don't know what I actually have to look for. It freaks me out. I've been watching videos, asking ChatGPT, asking friends in my course and I just don't understand. At least I'm doing it right at some point. Do you think you can explain it to me? :(Edit: Thanks to everyone who explained it to me!!! I finally understand and I'm so happy that I understand now! Makes everything so much easier, I never thought I'd ever get it, but I do! Thank you <3",

        "content": "My career has definitely taken a weird set of turns over the last few years to get me to end up where I have today. Initially, I started off building Tableau dashboards with datasets handed to me and things were good. After a while, I picked up Alteryx to better develop datasets meant specifically for Tableau reports. All good, no problems there. Eventually, I got hired at by a company to keep doing those two things, building reports and the workflows to support them.Now this company has had a lot of vendors in the past which means its data architecture and pipelines have spaghettied out of control even before I arrived. The company isn't a tech company, and there are a lot of boomers in it who can barely work Excel. It still makes a lot of money though, since it's primarily in the retail/sales space of luxury items. Once I took over, I've tried to do my best to keep things organized but it's a real mess. I should note that it's just me that manages these pipelines and databases, no one else really touches them. If there's ever a data question, they just ask me to figure it out.Fast forward to earlier this year, and my bosses tell me that they want to me explore Azure, the cloud, and see if we can move our analytics ahead. I have spent hours researching and trying to learn as much as I can. I created a Databricks instance and started writing notebooks to recreate some of the ETL processes that exist on our on-prem servers. I've definitely gotten more comfortable with writing code, databricks in general, and slowly understanding that world more, but the more I read online the more I feel like a total hack and fraud.I don't do anything with Git, I vaguely know that it's meant for version control but nothing past that. CI/CD is foreign to me. Unit tests, what are those? There are so many terms that I see in this subreddit that feel like complete jibberish to me, and I'm totally disheartened. How can I possibly bridge this gap? I feel like they gave me keys to a Ferrari and I've just been driving a Vespa up to this point. I do understand the concepts of data modeling, dim and fact tables, prod and dev, but I've never learned any formal testing. I constantly run into issues of a table updating incorrectly, or the numbers not matching between two reports, etc and I just fly by the seat of my pants. We don't have one source of truth or anything like that, the requirements constantly shift, the stakeholders constantly jump from one project to the other, it's all a big whirlwind.Can anyone else sympathize? What should I do? Hiring a vendor to come and teach me isn't an option, and I can't just quit to find something else, the market is terrible and I have another baby on the way. Like honestly, what the fuck do I do?",

Documentation is limited and inconsistent, with some scripts containing comments while others are over a thousand lines without any context. Communication is also spread across multiple messaging platforms, which makes it difficult to identify a single source of truth or establish consistent channels of collaboration.In addition, I have not yet had the opportunity to shadow a full migration, which has limited my ability to see how the process comes together end to end. Team responsiveness has been inconsistent, and despite several requests to connect, I have had minimal interaction with my manager. Altogether, these factors have made onboarding less structured than anticipated and have slowed my ability to contribute at the level I would like.I’ve started applying again, but my question to anyone reading is whether this experience seems like an outlier or if it is more typical of the field, in which case I may need to adjust my expectations.",

I'm a nerd that likes to be deep in the weeds. I don't like to create work or mentor, I like to be heads down doing development. I'd rather just be assigned work and do it, not try to come up with new work. Not everyone is meant to be a leader. And I hate this whole leadership theme. Is there a way I can describe this dilemma to my boss without him thinking I'm incapable of advancing?",

        "content": "After a week of fiddling with Great Expectations and getting annoyed at how poor and outdated the docs were, but also how much you need to set up to get it running in the first place I find myself wondering if there is a framework or tool that is actually better for testing (and more importantly monitoring) the quality of my data. For example if a table contains x values for daterange today but x-10% tomorrow I want to know asap.But I also wonder if I actually need a framework for testing the quality of my data, these queries are pretty easy to write. A tool just seemed fun because of all the free stuff you should be getting such as easy dashboarding. But actually storing the results of my queries and publishing them into a powerBI dashboard might actually be just as easy. The issue I have with most tools anyway is that a lot of my data is in NoSQL and many don't support that outside of a pandas dataframe.As I'm writing this post I am realizing it's probably best to just write these tests myself. However, still interested to know what everyone here uses. Collibra is probably the gold standard, but in no affordable enough for us.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I’m considering taking a break from book learning and instead contributing to a full-scale open-source project to deepen my practical skills.My goals are:- Gaining a deeper understanding of tools commonly used by data engineers- Improving my grasp of real-world software engineering practices- Learning more about database internals and algorithms (a particular area of interest)- Becoming a stronger contributor at work- Supporting my long-term career growthWhat I’m considering:- I’d like to learn a compiled language like C++ or Rust, but as a first open-source project, that might be biting off too much. I know Python well, so working in Python for my initial contribution would probably let me focus on understanding the codebase itself rather than struggling with language syntax.- I’m attracted to many projects, but my main worry is picking one that’s not regularly used at work—I'm concerned I’ll need to invest a lot more time outside of work to really get up to speed, both with the tool and the ecosystem around it.Project choices I’m evaluating:- dbt-core: My first choice, since we rely on it for all data transformations at work. It’s Python-based, which fits my skills, and would likely help me get a better grip on both the tool and large-scale engineering practices. The downside: it may soon see fewer new features or even eventual deprecation in favor of dbt-fusion (Rust). While I’m open to learning Rust, that feels like a steep learning curve for a first contribution, and I’m concerned I’d struggle to ramp up.- Airflow: My second choice. Also Python, core to our workflows, likely to have strong long-term support, but not directly database-related.- Clickhouse / Polars / DuckDB: We use Clickhouse at work, but its internals (and those of Polars and DuckDB) look intimidating—with the added challenge of needing to learn a new (compiled) language. I suspect the learning curve here would be pretty steep.- Scikit-learn: Python-based, and interesting to me thanks to my data science background. Could greatly help reinforce algorithmic skills, which seem like a required step to understand what happens inside a database. However, I don’t use it at work, so I worry the experience wouldn’t translate or stick as well, and it would require a massive investment of time outside of workI would love any advice on how to choose the right open-source project, how to balance learning new tech versus maximizing work relevance, and any tips for first-time contributors.",

At the startup, I got the opportunity to handle a Snowflake migration project, which made me really happy as Snowflake was booming at that time. I worked there for 1.3 years.With the money and experience I gained, I achieved my dream of coming to the USA. I resigned, but since the project had a lot of dependencies, they requested me to continue for 3 more months, which I was happy to do.And by the god grace i was also worked as GA for 2 semester while doing my masters.Now, I have completed my master’s degree and am looking for a job, but it feels like nobody cares about my 3 years of experience in India. Most of my applications are directly rejected. It’s been 9 months, and I feel like I’m losing hope and even some of my knowledge and skills, as I keep applying for hundreds of jobs daily.At this point, I want to restart, but I’m missing my consistency. I’m not sure whether I should completely focus on Azure, Python, Snowflake, or something else. Maybe I’m doing something wrong.",

In data vaults also similar things they are doing for hubs satellite and link tables. I don't quite understand why do additional processing by converting an existing primary key into a hash key? Instead, can't they use a continuous sequence as a primary key? What are the practical benefits of using a hashed value as a primary key?

I was never that fascinated by writing sql transformations but rather tooling, optimizations and infra and moved more and more to building platforms for data engineers.I now have 2 offers at hand (both pay equal). The first one is as a data engineer. I would be the only data guy in a department of 30 people and there is a large initiative to automate some financial reporting. The tasks are building dbt models with Trino. Also building some dashboards which I have never done. I would be responsible which is cool, but the tasks don’t seem to deep. Sure I could probably come up with e.g a testing pipeline for dbt models and implement that on my own to have some technical challenges but that is it. There is a department taking care of all services and development of the platform. I am a bit afraid that I will be stuck in writing pipelines when I take that job and will not be invited to tooling / infra heavy roles.The other one is as a platform engineer where I would work in a platform team to build multi cloud K8s microservices and handle monitoring and logging etc. That seems to be more challenging from a technical perspective but I would not be in the data sphere anymore. Do you think a switch back to data / data platform engineering is possible from there. Especially if I continue with open source?",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I just wanted to share a project that I had to postpone working on a month or two ago because of work responsibilities. I kind of envisioned it as a combination of n8n and tableau. Basically you use nodes to connect to data sources, transform data, and connect to ML models and graphs.It has 4 main components: A visual workflow builder, the backend for the workflows, a widget-based dashboard builder, and a backend for the dashboards. Each can be hosted separately via Docker.Essentially, you can build an ETL pipeline via nodes with the visual workflow builder, connect it to graph/model widgets in the dashboard builder, and deploy the backends. You can even easily embed your widgets/dashboards into any other website by generating a token in the dashboard builder.My favorite node is the web source node which aims to (albeit not perfectly as of yet) scrape structured or unstructured data by visually clicking elements from a website loaded in an iframe.I just wanted to share this with the broader community because I think it could be really cool, especially if people contributed nodes/widgets/features based on their own interests or needs. Anyways, the repository is [https://github.com/markm39/dxsh](https://github.com/markm39/dxsh), and the landing site is [https://dxsh.io](https://dxsh.io) Any feedback, contributions, or thoughts are greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Hi, maybe some of you have been in a similar situation.I am working with a team coming from a university background. They have never worked with databases, and I was hired as a data engineer to support them. My approach was to design and build a database for their project.The project goal is to run a model more than 3,000 times with different setups. I designed an architecture to store each setup, so results can be validated later and shared across departments. The company itself is only at the very early stages of building a data warehouse—there is not yet much awareness or culture around data-driven processes.The challenge: every meeting feels like a struggle. From their perspective, they are unsure whether a database is necessary and would prefer to save each run in a separate file instead. But I cannot imagine handling 3,000 separate files—and if reruns are required, this could easily grow to 30,000 files, which would be impossible to manage effectively.On top of that, they want to execute all runs over 30 days straight, without using any workflow orchestration tools like Airflow. To me, this feels unmanageable and unsustainable. Right now, my only thought is to let them experience it themselves before they see the need for a proper solution. What are your thoughts? How would you deal with it?",

I started as an ETL Developer back in 2018, worked my way into data engineering, and even spent a couple of years in prod support. For the most part, I’ve avoided senior/lead roles because I honestly enjoy just being handed specs and building pipelines or resolving incidents.But now, I’ve joined a medium-sized company as their only DE. The whole reason they hired me is to rebuild their messy data warehouse and move pipelines away from just cron jobs. I like the challenge and they see potential in me, but this is my first time setting things up from scratch: choosing tools, strategies, and making architectural decisions as “the data expert.”Here’s what I’ve got so far:- Existing DW is in Redshift, so we’re sticking with that for now.- We’ve got ~50 source systems, but I’m focusing on one first as a POC before scaling.- Approved a 3-layer schema approach per source (inspired by medallion architecture): raw → processing → final.- Ingestion: using dlt (tested successfully, a few tables already loaded into raw).- Transformations: using dbt to clean/transform data across layers.- Orchestration: Airflow (self-hosted).So far, I’ve tested the flow for a few tables and it looks good, at least from source → raw → processing.Where I’m struggling is in the modeling part:- The source backend DB is very flattened (e.g. one table with 300+ fields).- In the processing layer, my plan is to “normalize” these by splitting into smaller relational tables. This usually means starting to shape data into something resembling facts (events/transactions) and dimensions (entities like customers, products, orgs).- In the final/consumption layer, I plan to build more denormalized, business-centric marts for different teams/divisions, so the analytics side sees star/snowflake schemas instead of raw normalized tables.Right now, I’ve picked one existing report as a test case, and I’m mapping source fields into it to guide my modeling approach. The leads want to see results by Monday to validate if my setup will actually deliver value.My ask:Am I on the right track with this layering approach (normalize in processing → facts/dims → marts in consumption)? Is there something obvious I’m missing? Any resources or strategies you’d recommend to bridge this “flattened source → fact/dim → mart” gap?Thanks in advance! Any advice from those who’ve been in my shoes would mean a lot!",

        "content": "We're moving our ETL pipeline from Lambda and Step Functions to AWS Glue, however I'm having trouble figuring out how to handle file sequencing. We employ three Lambda functions to extract, transform, and load data in our current configuration. Step Functions manages all of this. The state machine takes all the S3 file paths that come from each Lambda and sends them to the load Lambda as a list. Each Transform Lambda can make one or more output files. The load Lambda understands exactly how to process the files since we control the order in that list and utilize environment variables to assist it understand the file roles. All of the files end up in the same S3 folder. The problem I'm having right now is that our new Glue task will produce a lot of files, and those files will need to be processed in a certain order. For instance, file1 has to be processed before file2. Right now, I'm using S3 event triggers to start the load Lambda, but S3 only fires one event per file, which messes up the order logic. To make things even worse, I can't change the load Lambda, and I want to maintain the system completely serverless and separate, which means that the Glue task shouldn't call any Lambdas directly. I'm searching for suggestions on how to handle processing files in order in this kind of setup. When Glue sends many files to the same S3 folder, is there a clean, serverless technique to make sure they are in the right order?",

        "author": "IntelligentNet9593",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I recently joined a small research organization (like 2-8 people) that uses several Access databases for all their administrative record keeping, mainly to store demographic info for study participants. They built a GUI in Python that interacts with these databases via SQL, and allows for new records to be made by filling out fields in a form. I have some computer science background, but I really do not know much at all about database management or SQL. I recently implemented a search engine in this GUI that displays data from our Access databases. Previously, people were sharing the same Access database files on a network drive and opening them concurrently to look up study participants and occasionally make updates. I've been reading and apparently this is very much not good practice and invites the risk for data corruption, the database files are almost always locked during the workday and the Access databases are not split into a front end and back end. This has been their workflow for about 5 years though, with thousands of records, and they haven't had any major issues. However, recently, we've been having an issue of new records being sporadically deleted/disappearing from one of the databases. It only happens in one particular database, the one connected to the GUI New Record form, and it seemingly happens randomly. If I were to make 10 new records using the form on the GUI, probably about 3 of those records might disappear despite the fact that they do immediately appear in the database right after I submit the form. I originally implemented the GUI search engine to prevent people from having the same file opened constantly, but I actually think the issue of multiple users is worse now because everyone is using the search engine and accessing data from the same file(s) more quickly and frequently than they otherwise were before. I'm sorry for the lengthy post, and if I seem unfamiliar with database fundamentals (I am). My question is, how can I best optimize their data management and workflow given these conditions? I don't think they'd be willing to migrate away from Access, and we are currently at a road block of splitting the Access files into front end and back end since it's on a network drive of a larger organization that blocks Macros, and apparently, the splitter wizard necessitates Macros. This can probably be circumvented. The GUI search engine works so well and has made things much easier for everyone. I just want to make sure our data doesn't keep getting lost and that this is sustainable.",

[https://www.starburst.io/blog/hive-vs-iceberg/](https://www.starburst.io/blog/hive-vs-iceberg/) [https://olake.io/iceberg/hive-partitioning-vs-iceberg-partitioning](https://olake.io/iceberg/hive-partitioning-vs-iceberg-partitioning) Sharing it here in case others are in the same boat.Curious to hear your experiences are you still making Hive work, or already making the shift to Iceberg?",

I've already got an OpenSSH / sFTP server on my laptop on which I've deployed some files for Airbyte to ingest into a local database. Airbyte v0.30.1 is installed, Docker Desktop is running and my local instance of Airbyte appears to be working fine.I've created the connections to the sFTP server and the local database, and these tested fine in the local Airbyte web UI. In the logs and Event Viewer, I can also see the Airbyte account logging into the sFTP server without any problems.I get now stuck in creating the Airbyte Connection in the local web UI - after picking source and target, and sync mode, it's not showing any schema whatsoever. Even when I change the Airbyte file source to point to one specific file, it just isn't seeing showing a schema. I've checked the user account that logs into the sFTP server and it has all the privs it needs. When I use the same account in WinSCP, I can connect just fine - and I can view, download, rename, delete, move, etc. any file on the sFTP server itself, so I'm not sure if there's an issue with the sFTP user account privs?Any idea on why Airbyte cannot read the schema? I've been trying to look at logs in the Docker image but haven't found anything useful yet. Is there a way to more accurately debug this process somehow?",

She has used this huge, slow, unvalidated query that I wrote for her to create reports with AI. She always wants stuff added to it so it keeps growing. She manually downloads data from customers into csv. AI wrote python to make html reports from csv.She’s made good reports for customers but it all lives entirely outside of our app. Shes having issues making it work for all clients, so they want me to get involved.My thinking is to let her do her thing, and then once designed, build the reports into our app. With the goal being:1) Using simple, validated functions/queries (that we spent a lot of time making test cases to validate) and not this big ass query2) Each report component is modularized and easily reusable in other reports3) Generating a report is all obviously automated. Now, they messaged me today about providing estimates on delivering something similar to the app’s reporting structure for her to use offline, just generating the html from csv, using the monster query. With the goal that:1) She can continue to craft reports with AI having all data points readily available 2) The reports can easily be plugged into the app’s reporting infrastructure Another idea that they thought of that I didn’t think much of at first was to just copy her AI generated html into the app so it has a place to live for clients.My biggest concerns are the AI not understanding our schema, what is available to use as far as validated functions, etc. Having to manage stuff offline vs in the app. Using this unnecessary big ass query. Having to work with what the AI produces.Should I push going full AI route and not dealing with the app at all? Or try to keep the AI just for design and lean heavier on the app side?Am I overreacting? Please help.",

I believe this sheet is redundant as it is the same information being entered in twice and manually, so there is room for errors. I will mentioned that there are drop down menus within the sheet in excel, which sometimes needs to be changed to a different value depending on the information of the order. However, there are probably only a max of 6 combinations. So really I could have 6 separate sheets that the information would need to go into for each combination if needed.I am hoping there is a way to extract specific data from salesforce and input it directly into these sheets? Typically there can be anywhere from 1 to 50 sheets that get made each day. And each sheet contains different information for each specific order. However, the information is always in the same spot within salesforce I am hoping there is a way to this automatically where I would go through each order in sales force and push a couple of buttons to extract that data into these sheets. Or a completely automated wayI think I have fully explained what it is I am trying to do. But if its not clear let me know. If I am able to achieve this, it will save me so much time and energy!

I'm concerned that when looping through the list, some companies might update their prices more than once, and I could miss some data.

From what I have read, in Iceberg there's a functionality called time travel that let you use the exact same query with \"AS OF your_timestamp\" to get the results of the past. It seems to me that it can be useful in generating historical trends over time.However, I also read that in the long term, for example when you have data that spans over years, using time travel to generate historical trends is actually a very bad idea in terms of performance and is an anti-pattern. I also tried asking AIs, which some of them told me it's fine and some of them tell me to look at Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions when building the tables.I am a bit lost here and some help and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",

        "content": "Hi,it's my first post here. I come from a DevOps background but am getting more and more Data Engineering tasks recently.I am trying to setup database replication to a data lakehouse.First of all, here are some specifications about my current situation :* The source database is configured on relevant tables with a CDC system.* The IT Team managing this database is against direct connection so they are redirecting the CDC to another database to act as a buffer/audit step. Before an ETL pipeline will load the relevant data and send files to S3 compatible Buckets.* The source data is very well defined, with global standards applied to all tables and columns in the database.* The data lakehouse is using Apache Iceberg, with Spark and Trino for transformation and exploration. We are running everything in Kubernetes (except the buckets).We want to be able to replicate relevant tables to our data lakehouse in an automated way. The resfresh rate could be every hour, half-hour, 5 minutes, etc ... No need for streaming right now.I found some important points to look for :* how do we represent the transformation in the exchanged files (SQL transactions, before/after data) ?* how do we represent table schema ?* how do we make the correct type conversion from source format to Iceberg format ?* how do we detect and adapt to schema evolution ?I am lost thinking about all possible solutions and all of them seem to *reinvent the wheel*:* use the strong standards applied to the source database. modification timestamp columns are present in every table and could allow us to not need CDC tools. A simple ETL pipeline could query the inserted/updated/deleted data since the last batch. This would lead us to Ad Hoc solutions : simple but limited with evolution.* use Kafka (or Postgresql FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED trick) with a custom Json like file format to represent the CDC aggregated output. Once the file format defined, we would use Spark to ingest the data into Iceberg.I am sure there as to be existing solutions and patterns to this problem.Thanks a lot for any advice !PS : I rewrote the post to remove the unecessary on premise/cloud specification. Still the source database is an on premise IBM AS400 database if anyone is interested. PPS : also why can't I use any bold characters ?? Reddit keep telling me my text is AI content if I set any character to bold PPPS : sorry dear admin, keep up the good work",

        "author": "RockaBabyDarling",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.If you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.I've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.If you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**Take as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as \"you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,\" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, \"Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,\" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself \"what was I thinking here?\" then you're not growing.**Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.Lastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking \"okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,\" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.So if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.Edit: fixed several small grammatical and spelling errors due to voice to text",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've been seeing this question pop up almost every day for a year and a half, and it's always the same old story… 'I'm 17, 19 years old' + 'I feel like college is a waste of money' + 'All I want is to work' + 'How do I become a developer without a degree?'Let me be honest with you: your chances are very slim. Sure, you can teach yourself everything you need in 3 to 5 years, maybe two if you push hard, and build a good portfolio. But what's your plan to find that dev job? You think you'll ace the technical interviews? Great. But how will you even get those interviews? Your CV, no matter how much you polish and fix it, will look very weak next to someone from a coding bootcamp, not to mention a CS graduate applying for the same entry-level job.Look, I get you. College is very expensive, and they won't teach you specific job-related things like Vue or Svelte. Many people, myself included, entered this field without a CS degree. But my path wasn't easy. I managed to get dev experience at a company I was already with, and that gave me the two years of experience (2 YOE) required for them to even look at my resume for my current job. And I got that first job because I had a bachelor's and master's degree in a completely different field they happened to need. Even with all that, I sent out about 250 applications, got 3 interviews, and in the end, only one offer. And that single offer came through a referral by pure luck.The irony is that you can indeed learn all the required skills for a fraction of the cost and in less than 5 years, thanks to all the amazing online resources available. But if you're about to finish high school and haven't entered college yet, I'm honestly very surprised that some people think skipping college is the 'easy path.' You're not taking a shortcut; on the contrary, you're choosing the hardest path. You're like a salmon trying to swim upstream – a few might make it, but the vast majority won't.If you want to gamble with your professional future, that's your decision. You can always try to go to college after you've likely struggled a lot to find your first job. The only thing you'll lose is time, and you can never get that back. I just don't understand why someone would intentionally make it harder for themselves from the start. This field is very difficult to get into.Just to be clear, this is directed at young people of typical college age who don't have major life responsibilities like children or debt. If you're older – say 26, 31, 36 – and thinking of a career change, this isn't for you. I myself am 38 and just entered this field a few years ago. For us, the calculation is different. But for the young folks, I'm telling you as a self-taught dev: this path is a meat grinder, and I absolutely do not recommend it.Some people might misunderstand me. I'm not saying you're a lesser person for not having a degree. I'm saying that HR and recruiters will likely filter out your CV and not look at it because there are stronger ones. It's all a numbers game. Imagine a single entry-level job gets 700 applications. Let's say 350 have CS degrees, 250 have bootcamp certificates, and 100 are self-taught. The hiring manager needs to pick 25 or 35 people to interview. Why would they even start with the self-taught pile? From their perspective, it's easier and safer to pull the best CVs from the people with CS degrees. It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality.Am I the only one who thinks the 'follow your passion' advice is a scam? This is the title of an [article ](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1nihjhc/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_follow_your/)I came across recently. My opinion is that passion is important, but your education is extremely important. Don't give up your education, which will most likely qualify you for a job, for an uncertain path.",

        "content": "For context, I dived into programming as a side hobby in high school in the early 2000s. My little fun projects were text-based adventure games in C and Pascal, or drawing an analog clock with arrows on the screen, or visualising sine and cosine waves on a 3D surface.None of that was anything remotely practical or beautiful in terms of the code. It, however, won me “nerd status” among my schoolmates and peers. According to them, I was the one that truly knew how to program. These little projects were enough to land my first programming jobs.Things seem to be quite different now. My son will soon approach the teenage period, and with the current state of the industry, I’m hesitant whether it’s worth involving him in this field.Apparently, none of the average HR folks today would get impressed by a similar portfolio. You are supposed to develop an “app” just like “X”, that “solves something”, using the cloud infrastructure of a big corporation and the latest front-end framework, pushed by another corporation. This comes with a significant investment in a particular toolset, and requires heavy scaffolding, possibly assisted with LLMs. On the job market, you are not a “programmer” anymore. You are someone who is familiar with a very narrow set of tools, and need to market yourself accordingly.",

However, this will result in circular dependency since Buff class knows about unit, and Unit class need to know about Buff.I could use a interface or abstract class to only expose a certain part of the implementation detail, it still feels messy because the fact that usage is circular doesnt change. I thought of having a external class that owns unit and buffs, so theres no circular dependency, but it doesn't feel satisfying, because logically, unit should own buff because that buff applies to it and itself only.",

I even worked through the free [GDQuest GDScript course](https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/), but I still can’t figure out how to make a basic character controller on my own. Like seriously, im just staring at a screen without an inkling of where to begin or what functions to all for it!Part of me feels like my anxiety and inner critic are making this worse, but I can’t help wondering: am I just not talented enough or maybe good/smart enough to code?How long does it realistically take to learn programming/cs? Do most people struggle this much at the start?I am currently trying to work on a character controller and dont understand the functions, and various tech required to make it work. Do people just intuitively know this stuff, or is this something that everyone copies from tutorials online/learn once and keep reusing? - this is my dilemma, and question to fellow programmers. - hence asking if im cut out for this at all. Also, would it make more sense to take a structured course like CS50, or should I just keep practicing by building small things directly in Godot?Any advice or encouragement would be really appreciated.I really just want to make cool things online. Stress free.Thanks.\\- RedRadical",

        "content": "I currently work in IT, a lot of hands on with actual equipment, switches, servers, etc, EU support yada yada. Kinda looking to see what’s out there to get away from the on-call lifestyle and EU support.I’ve started to take an interest in Databases/Data Analytics (really anything working with data), particularly MySQL to start. I took some simple database courses years back in college and thought they were fun, and from just browsing, the work hours seem pretty concrete and work/life balance is pretty nice (from what I read).I would say i’m about ~15 - 20 hours in following a Udemy course that i’m nearing finishing. I just started doing some online “practice” like AnalystBuilder and I can confidently say I feel like maybe 1/2 of what I learned through udemy courses stuck lol. I’m not discouraged, but I am curious what to expect if I keep going down the rabbit hole.First off, i’m curious to what actual Data Engineers/Analysts think about starting to learn SQL now that AI had changed the game imo. I could imagine if AI scales like it has been in the last few years, in less than 10 years part of data analysis will be fully automated (like everything else probably). Whats the panic level in the industry if any? I know some engineering jobs are more resilient.More relevant to me and my learning process:How long would you say it takes to really grasp and understanding of syntax? To me it all seems very overwhelming, I have a feeling a lot of you will say you’ve been working with it for a decade and still reference the docs every day for simple stuff lol, but I mean for it to “click” when reading a question, instead of having to revisit material to jog your memory.What was the best way you learned? Videos? Real world problems (websites for practice), actual real world data? I’m open to suggestions, but i don’t want to waste my time with doing things like AnalystBuilder if there are better ways to get a real glimpse into the day in the life if that makes sense and will prepare me for an actual job.I am a college grad in Computer science (CIS), so i’m willing to bet just like all other CS jobs, its a brutal job market, are certs absolutely needed? Or should i focus on building projects? Wondering what sets people apart from the hiring process according to those in the industry.If theres anything else i’m neglecting to see with all of this, feel free to give advice or words of motivation as well!",

It felt like the right choice since it’s practical, has lots of learning resources, and can give me a good foundation before I move on to advanced topics.Now I’m a bit over halfway through, but I’ve started to lose some motivation. I notice that with AI can do many tasks if you know and understand how things work . Besides AI can do many other task easily outside of programming.As I think ahead 5–6 years, I wonder how much more advanced AI will become, and it makes me question whether my efforts are meaningful, and is it right career pathOn top of that, I work full-time. After work I’m usually tired, but I push myself to learn because I enjoy coding and want to do something on my own way which keeps me motivated. Recently though, I’ve been feeling burnt out and a little depressed, because I fear that after investing all this time, If I can not do something, I will feel lost. As I had decided to pursue this path as a long term career, so this doubt is weighing heavily on me.I’m not learning this for a job and job is optional (I know the market is saturated ).• What should I do? • Should I consider changing career path or should I stick with it ?Please help me to figure it out because I could not make any decision.I would really appreciate your honest opinions and advice.P.S.

I've created a SQL Server database, scrapers, BI reports and scripts (in a VM) that automate many of the company processes (currently looking to get into SAP SDK). The thing is, I feel I could do so much better. Since I don't have any seniors to teach me, I feel I've been doing all of these without following good programming and security practices. For example, in the VM, I run all my daily automation scripts with Task Scheduler and .bats (last week I learned I should encapsulate these scripts). I don't know if my projects follow the best structure or if they are modular enough, etc. Although everything works and there's no complaints by the company, I know what I'm doing is not good enough and could learn so much more (and do things the \"correct\" way). What do you guys would recommend me I should focus on learning? Any books, courses or even bootcamps you recommend? What can I do differently? Although I don't feel like a junior anymore, I definetely feel there's so much I should learn before even considering calling myself a senior. Thanks for the help in advance!",

Because they are fundamental, they stay the same across all programming languages.What I’m seeking is a comprehensive resource that explains all these constructs step by step, in thorough detail and depth.

Only until I can recite every fact mentioned to me in the slide and more am I ready for the exam, or even my homework.At the very least, trying to memorize all the given axioms(definitions, rules, properties, relationships)gives you a vernacular to communicate confusion with a practice problem more clearly than “I don’t know where to start. I don’t get this.”the problem is when I also don’t know what exactly to memorize, such as in programming which can be more laissez faire in teaching, you are told to just start coding in order to learn.  When I tried to look into whether I should take ‘intermediate’ and ‘advanced’ intro to x programming language courses online at the very least to develop more vocabulary to google implementation and debug effectively, I saw comments such as these:[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem\\_student\\_here\\_should\\_i\\_master\\_one\\_programming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem_student_here_should_i_master_one_programming/)Don't focus on languages. Think of something fun (database, web app, data science project, whatever), research what languages fit the use case and just build it. Nothing beats the skills you gather from solving your own problems and they will mostly be transferrable to other technologies later on.THAT BEING SAID, if you really want to get deep into understanding programming languages from the ground up, get yourself a copy of \"C - A modern approach\" (K. N. King, available on the internet archive for free). It will teach you the most fundamental of all programming languages, C, but almost more importantly: You will understand every other language afterwards more easily, especially a lot of design decisions in C++, Java, Rust and many more.It has little exercises and some larger programming projects in it to directly apply the stuff you read about. The book might seem intimidating at 800 pages, but it's actually a rather swift read, there are just a lot of examples and additional explanations. [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how\\_to\\_learn\\_advanced\\_python/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how_to_learn_advanced_python/)OP, everyone so far except the duck saxophone guy is giving you shitty advice.You already know decorators exist. You've never used them. Do you think reading about other things that also exist will help you learn how to use them?Don't read a thing. **If you want to learn advanced programming, start working on an advanced project**. Aim too high.When you can't figure out how to do something or think that there must be an easier way to do this or that, then go look that up, read that, and implement it. Then go on programming.Reading advanced literature without programming yourself is useless. I tried to follow this advice to just make projects even when I felt I was just incoherently babbling when searching for implementation approaches  and googling errors & bugs. I mainly just got yelled at on stack overflow for asking trite questions I could have googled and posting overly specific  project case scenarios,  but I lacked the vocabulary to dissect  and google my problems in a  better way.I might as well just try going through dozens of “master python books” because at least it’s something different, I am like a baby pointing at food it wants without any better way to communicate and getting yelled at for it.  sometimes I don’t even fully understand the ‘food’(implementation) I want because I cannot describe ‘tastes’ or ‘ingredients’(don’t understand how to design the pseudocode/blueprints properly or  account for every needed feature)I just know: “it needs to be sour”  But similarly to  a person learning a second language you must also commit the axioms to memory to then be able to question and deduce.  It is just hard memorizing so many things at once.  How do I allocate time between rereading over and over, trying to ask a question to actively engage then going on a wikipedia rabbit hole of concepts I don’t understand or questions I lack the field terminology to phrase coherently, and I ultimately feel it is ridiculous even though I try to remind myself it is necessary.recall back to grammar classes. compared to learning vernacular which is just involuntary exposure to people speaking 24/7, grammar has to be established by rote practice- but also by reading books for exposure to information. I  just keep forgetting, especially in programming, but I don’t reread books, I usually rewatch intro to x programming language video and then start trying to google reference to implement a feature for a project.I don’t know how trying to design a project then awkwardly googling with no real certainty of what you are looking for is any different than tutorial hell.",

        "content": "For context, I'm a final year CS student and although throughout my course I've learnt basics on Java, SQL, C++, I honestly do not remember them nor do I really care for them much. I'm a little more familiar with Python since I specialize in AI and had some focus on data science courses. I'm ok with Data Science technologies like R and Python but I'm not really as interested in analysing data as I am with AI. So I know where I want to go from here. I've found some things I need to focus on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but let me be honest I really am overwhelmed and lost where to go from here. There's just too many resources, frameworks, technologies and I don't know how to start from scratch.I feel like I wasted my past few years in Uni even though my GPA is decent because I usually forgot most things I learned after the course is over and never really applied it to projects. To add on, I'm just learning how to upload projects on github. I like solving problems and experimenting with AI especially back in one module I learnt on Computer Visions and Natural Language so I know I'm interested in that. So before I graduate, I really want to focus on building up skills and making projects.But here's the problem I hate reading theory and going back over basic foundations because I already understand the basics and it's boring to do pointless tutorials on websites like FreeCodeCamp or the likes. I'm currently just starting with smaller projects like [practisepython.org](http://practisepython.org) and learning CLI projects on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but even those are not going to help me learn AI models and technologies. I'm aware I can't just jump to that without practising coding on smaller projects like what I'm doing but I would also prefer to learn while doing some challenging projects that are not too hard but at the same time forces me to learn new things along the way. For example, I just started trying to build a chatbot using langchain documentation but even setting up the dependencies are a pain in the ass.I really want to learn and develop my AI skills before I graduate in a very time-efficient manner so I would appreciate on any advice, tips, resources that are not theory heavy/focused or boring tutorials.

You will learn much more by finishing any course than trying to constantly jump to a better one.# Lecture BasedThese are classes offered by universities (Harvard, MIT, Helsinki, etc). The structure is a weekly lecture given a professor, an assigned reading, and a problem set.They are generally self-paced. Some will grade your submissions, and some will even give you a certificate of completion, it's not worth much, but it can be motivating.**Harvard CS50** and friends (CS50P, CS50 AI, etc) — These serve as general introductions. They have been taken by thousand and are high quality. CS50 teaches you the basics of *C* (Week 1-5), *Python* (week 6), *SQL* (week 7), and finally some *HTML* with *Flask*. CS50P (Python) is similar but focuses on Python only, you cover the basics (conditionals, loops, exception, libraries, testing, I/O, and some OOP). If you sign up through EdX you can track your progress.# Text BasedThese courses are mostly text based, you read through a module then go practice an assignment.Popular courses include: The Odin Project, FullStack Open, FreeCodeCamp, and Code Academy.**The Odin Project** teaches you the basics of Web Development. The first part focuses on HTML, CSS, and JS. Then splits into either FullStack JS (React, Node, Express) or Fullstack Rails (React, Ruby). The final module offers tips on getting hired. They have a big discord community.**Fullstack Open** is another high quality resource focused on Web Development. It starts with the the basics of HTML & CSS, before quickly jumping into React. The next modules show you to work with NodeJS and express to build a backend.# BooksI'm a big fan books, anything from **O'Reilly**, **Manning**, or **Starch Press** is usually solid.Books like *Automate the Boring stuff with Python* are often recommended, you can download it for free.I learned C, C++, and Rust from books, ex: *Effective C*, *C++ Crash Course*, *The Rust Book*# Interactive**Scrimba** & **Bootdev** are websites that have interactive exercises, they follow a freemium model where some content is free, but you have to pay to unlock everything. I tired Scrimba and I was pretty impressed.# Others**100Devs** is another popular community with a large discord channel. The course is a series of videos by Leon Noel, there are weekly streams and weekly hours.**Udemy** — ex: **100 days of Code by Angela Yu**. This is a very popular course that focuses on building 1 python project per day, you start off with a Blackjack app, then Snake Game, parsing CSV data, building UI with Python, using a SQL db, using Flask, Git, etc. *This one is not free, you have to pay.***PluralSight** *—* Pretty good quality, has courses on most technologies. It's how I learned Docker, React, Angular, and a few others.No links due to Reddit Filters",

The main thing I'm worried about is getting hit with those obscure \"random trivia\" questions (the kind of ones you see on LinkedIn that always seem to be trick questions) during an interview.* I am most familiar with Python (using it for 3 years), but I haven't been that successful with projects for it. A lot of the time I burn out on projects and they go unfinished. Still, I think I have a relatively deep understanding of the language, features, and ecosystem.* Over the past year and a half I've been using TypeScript and React for projects. I think it's been way more successful than the Python so far. I followed a course for it and I have some projects I'm really proud of. React is very complicated, though, and it seems I'm expected to know more about how it works under the hood (virtual DOM, rendering, lifecycle, performance, etc.).Based on what I said about both these things, can I even put either of them on my resume? Do I need to have more languages than this? Any advice?",

We are implementing a new portability layer that contains interfaces for various thread control objects, such as semaphores, mutexes and so on. I have been replacing OS-specific semaphores with calls into the new portability layer version, and have been mystified by how the semaphores were being used.Without going into specifics, the question I have is this: Is there an upper limit on the number of resources a semaphore initialized to control N resources can actually control? In the new implementation, it seems to me that even if the semaphore is controlling a single resource, if I call Post() 100 times, I can then call Wait() 100 times and the calling thread will never be blocked and we'll have 100 threads simultaneously using the protected resource.I would have expected that if I create a semaphore to control a single resource and then call Post() twice, the second call would fail because there isn't a second resource to release.Colleagues are telling me that it is normal for a semaphore to be able to be released an unlimited number of times. Is that really true?",

Because for me, even if you type it line by line and know what is the purpose of each line, it still feels like copy-pasting, and it doesn’t really enhance your problem-solving skills. In the end, you’re still just copying the AI’s code and not creating your own code structure. but I can't make own code structure without AI cause i don't know what should i put in this line or in that line and so on.",

        "author": "Sea-Client1355",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Right now, U.S. companies spend over $161 billion every year on offshore tech services from India alone. The HIRE Act 2025 proposes a 25% tax on offshore spending, which would generate about $40 billion annually. That figure comes just from U.S. spending in India, before even considering other countries. Instead of disappearing overseas, that money would be reinvested here at home, funding apprenticeships, reskilling programs, and workforce training. In practice, that means more Americans getting the chance to learn in-demand tech skills, land better jobs, and actually compete for the roles that are currently being offshored.With the new $100K H-1B fees, companies will likely push even more jobs offshore. That’s why the HIRE Act matters, it’s the only effort on the table to regulate offshoring and redirect that money into building up our own workforce.Money-hungry U.S. companies keep chasing lower costs overseas instead of putting resources into developing Americans and strengthening the US economy.[HIRE Act 2025 (PDF)](https://www.moreno.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-HIRE-Act.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

        "content": "I am SWE with 8 YOE. Nothing too niche, full stack developer that knows a few web dev tech stacks with most recent titles of senior and tech lead. No AI or ML. I was laid off in June. Prepared hard, polished my resume with AI many times, applied to between 200-300 jobs in the span of 2 months. Got about 15 interviews, 4 offers. I think I could get more offers tbh but after I found the company I really liked I accepted an offer and stopped the interview process with the rest. I interviewed with Capital One, Visa, UKG, Amazon, Circle, Apollo, Citadel, FICO, GM and some no names or startups. That’s all to say that after reading reddit I was anxious to even apply but I think I got a decent amount of interviews and negotiated my offers to be either at the higher end of the salary range for the role or even above advertised. I do recognize it’s much harder for junior engineers these days but is there really a shortage for experienced engineers? I haven’t felt that. I’m not even a native English speaker although I do speak English fluently. I’m in the US. I also didnt lie on resume or cheated during coding rounds. Some of them I solved 100%, some not. For example for C1 I got 450/600 points on CodeSignal and still got a callback and an offer after clearing their power day. Ask me anything I guess. Happy to help someone if I can. No referrals though, sorry. I’ve just started a few weeks ago, too early to refer especially someone I don’t personally know. Here are a few things that I believe gave me an edge or worked in my favor:- referrals from my network- local jobs that required hybrid schedule- tailored resumes- soft skills- activity on LinkedIn (mostly commenting)I also tried to outsource the filling out job applications part so I can focus on preparing and interviewing but I didn’t have much success with freelancers from Fiverr. I was also approached by a “do it for you” company but they charge % of your first year salary + a fixed fee and I decided to just do it myself.",

I had been at my current position for almost 2 years (started as a contractor in November 2023, then was hired directly in November 2024). Today I was suddenly laid off, and although I've been laid off before, this took me by surprise. There was no warning, and from what I'd heard, it sounded like my team was actually doing pretty well - My team was contributing to things that were being delivered and sold; also, just last week, our manager had said people like what my team was able to get done, and people were actually considering sending another project to our team. I went in to work this morning as usual, and then my manager took me aside into a conference room and let me know I was being laid off. He said it's just due to the economic situation and has nothing to do with my performance. And I had to turn in my stuff and leave immediately. My manager said if there are more openings (maybe in January), he'd hire me back.As I had been there only a short time, I was still learning things about the company's software & products, but I was getting things done. I'd heard things about the industry as a whole, but it sounded like we were doing well, so this feels like it came out of nowhere, as I was not given any advance notice. My wife and I have been planning a vacation (finally) too; we bought tickets & everything to leave not even 2 weeks from now.I'm getting a bit frustrated with the industry's trend of repeated layoffs. And naturally, companies end up seeing a need to hire more people again eventually.. I like software development, but sometimes I wonder if I should have chosen a different industry.",

Tbh, I never really put that much importance into what version we used at work, (I work at big tech company), but then the recruiter said I don't match the job requirements because I don't have the Java 17 experience. Im genuinely confused as this my first interview in a minute with a startup, is picking up java 17 just like reading documentation to keep up with updates? Or is this market just that picky. I genuinely don't understand why that's a rejection point? Or can more experienced Java devs or backends devs explained if the rejection for that reason was justified?",

I feel like since the start of this year especially every company is making their devs work 50+ hours while also doing mass layoffs.I've been interviewing with different companies and there have been multiple instances where they expect the candidate to work 50-60 hours a week, come into the office 5x a week, or work 6 days out of the week. This shit sucks.Big tech has gotten intense and stressful so its hard to chill there. Startups have insane competition and are tight on money so the expectations are you working super hard to make this thing survive.I understand this isn't true for 100% of companies but it feels like at least 70% of companies kind of suck to work at as a SWE. And by suck I mostly mean super stressful despite the pay and perks still being pretty good.In conclusion, if every company kind of sucks I might as well take the highest paid role I can since they're all going to have intense expectations.TLDR; does every company kind of suck to work at so take the job with most money?",

I get tickets out the door and complete tasks. I think I generally do a good job, but I feel like my coding skills are still weak. At my job there is no real mentoring, company structure, training, or development. I feel mediocre because I can't contribute at the same level as a senior dev and I've been doing this for 5 years. I also feel like the actual coding part does not play to my natural skillset (I never coded as a kid, I didn't do well at math) and so I find I'm not picking up naturally (things light architecture and system design). This week my company said that everyone must be on track to be a senior developer, and must become a senior developer in an allotted amount of time (specifics of this haven't been provided yet). I know you might suggest that I do a bunch of side projects and weekend work, but I've got young kids and honestly no time for learning outside of work. I like my job, it pays the bills, but when I compare myself to the seniors I work with, I know I will never be as good of a developer.",

I’ve never caused carry over or an immediate defect since joining the team so I had no problem, and I send every question I ask since my tech lead keeps telling him I’m not technically independent.After two sprints, my manager was like “yeah I don’t have anything to say about this, I’ll look into what you can do to get to exceeding expectations. Make sure you’re more vocal about your accomplishments from here on out.”So just like that, I went from being underperforming and on the verge of being let go for 7 months straight to doing fine. I guess my tech lead was overwhelming him with so much negative feedback that he thought “man, this guy must be having people straight up coding for him every sprint.” Absolutely not. My work is my own work. I never caused carry over. I do not have people code for me. I ask for help by saying what I tried first. But this whole experience has really made me feel stressed and unstable in this position. I’m doing the work load of a senior developer with one year of experience currently, and my tech lead wants me to do that while approving pr’s (no problem) while fixing random problems with the application( problem) , while volunteering for extra work (beyond what I can do). And if I say a “bad question” this guy goes straight to my manager. What is a bad question? Whatever pisses him off after his boss gets done yelling at him apparently. Edit: oh yea, and I do technically have autofilled, easy placeholder goals. New manager didn’t know and i didn’t know, but I have performance goals like “say how you upheld company values”And what I get another manager? What if he isn’t a good one and just believes whatever my tech lead says? What if, while doing my senior developer workload, I end up carrying over ONE user story(now my tech lead actually has an excuse to get me fired, my manager will be the first person he messages.) And yes, I am going to apply for more jobs, but I’m also not vested(employer contributions to my 401k aren’t settled) until I hit the two year mark. That’s a little bit away. But this has all left me with so many questions.Is this normal? What just happened? Should I go all in on applying for other jobs? Should I wait to vest? Do you think I’ll get fired before I vest? Is software engineering stable long term because this feels pretty unstable for me and I want to get married and have a stable income.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm a CS and data sci double major at an average state school with an average CS dept, in my senior year. I have some internship experience, but from joke roles where I barely do anything (and barely get paid anything). The people there (and my friends) say I do good, but I don't think so. My resume has been reviewed and I'm told it looks excellent, but I feel like I blow up a lot of it and that the whole thing is this shitty cardboard Potemkin village set that'll just collapse with one nudge. Some of my resume stuff is literally just stupid ChatGPT stuff. I feel like I'm likely to fail any technical interview or OA I'm given, and while I'm actively trying to correct this, I think it's genuinely too little too late. I can barely remember a lot of the stuff I've learned a few years ago (including pre-GPT). I believe if I were where I currently am but 1 year ago, I'd actually be really cracked and have better success with internships, but now it's too late to apply to most of those.I'm realistic about my goals and don't expect to ever break into FAANG or anything of that tier in my lifetime. I knew I wasn't FAANG material since high school. But all I want is to be able to live on my own away from my shitty Asian parents. I've applied to tech roles at non-tech companies, SWE-adjacent roles rather than pure SWE, etc. On average I'm speaking with one real human per month, but as I move into full-time recruitment rather than intern recruitment, I notice signs of this slowing.I feel average no matter what I do. And in this job market, you cannot be average. I feel gravely ashamed of myself for being so average when I was smart in elementary school. (Long story but I got kicked out of middle school, which could explain my inability to succeed or be \"at the top of the pack\"). In many ways I honestly regret even majoring in CS, but I concede many other fields, e.g. the hard sciences, might've been even worse choices for me, and had I chosen those I wouldn't likely even have semi-stellar grades to brag about. And since I'm so far ahead in the game, it's literally too late to even do so. Plus my parents refuse to pay beyond 4 years of tuition and think delaying graduation is stupid (and to be honest they're probably right). When I suggested pivoting to nursing or the trades, they just laughed in my face over how poorly I'd do in those jobs (and again, they're right, I genuinely am physically weak and would struggle in those roles).If things don't get better by next summer after I graduate, I honestly wonder if I should just spend all of my money on bus tickets to some random city in the Midwest and live on the street there. Maybe blow the rest on lottery tickets since at this point there's almost no difference. Sure beats having to shuttle to and from my crummy parents' house. I sometimes wish I could turn back time and obey my parents more so I wouldn't be in this situation, but then I realize even that wouldn't have helped.I know that ideally, this year I should be going crazy with everything, but at this point I'm saddled with so many course and other responsibilities (including some dismaying parental conflicts) that I think there's a genuine possibility that my grades could even plummet below 3.6 GPA. Also, my parents are also begging me to consider a Master's, but I really don't even know if I should do so - what if even with a Master's I fail?For further context I'm Chinese American, have an autism dx, and grew up under a Protestant Christian background. So what should I do, and how hopeless do I seem?",

And it will make you feel that everything is hopeless.It's important for your mental health that you moderate this. Yes, the job market is bad, but the posts in this subreddit make it seem far worse than it is.Now for a **real talk** about some people...I've been going around helping people with their resumes and portfolios to fix potential issues, and one thing I have noticed is that there is a decent amount of people (not all) who could do a lot more to boost their chances but feel demotivated from the job market and have just given up too early.I'm talking people who have applied for tons of software jobs but don't have a single original complete project on their github, or who have just got their degree and have nothing else to back it up.Yes the job market is bad. Yes it is harder than it was a few years ago. No it is not impossible. While for a lot of people their resume and portfolio are strong, there is a decent amount who actually need some honesty and realize that part of the problem is them.The most recent one I saw was a guy saying the job market was cooked, the comments offering a lot of sympathy. But the guy had a mess of projects on his github in obscure niche areas of programming with no comments or READMEs or anything to help organize it or explain what it was. And then had one of the least concise resumes I'd seen, I had to read over half of it just to try and even figure out what tech skills he had. Yet had been complaining he hadn't been able to get a tech job despite trying for over a year. I was honest but kind about it and gave advice and told him to ask for honest advice from people rather than just getting sympathy.Before I get **downvoted into oblivion**, I am not saying this is true of everyone. It's just common enough from the posts I've seen in the last few weeks when I've looked at people's resumes and githubs/portfolios.* Have personal projects that are original. (Keep code copied from tutorials for learning, not for showing publicly)* Have tech skills that are relevant to jobs in your area.* Organize them neatly and with clear information for people to read.* Get your resume checked by different people. Do small projects with other people to show you can collaborate.* Help with open source projects to show you can meaningfully contribute to work that isn't yours.I am not denying at all that it's way harder than it use to be to land a tech job but it's not impossible either.",

I just feel like if I apply to big tech now, others who have already worked for big name tech companies will get through and I will be thrown to the bottom of the pile.I just feel it sucks as I know if I grinded leetcode and actually applied more before graduating/and also got an internship, then got a job in big tech. I could probably get interviews in different countries right now and have so much lifestyle freedom too.Does anyone have any advice? Or is it really just a case now of spam applying to big companies and hopefully one day get a callback...",

I am absolutely heartbroken considering how big of an opportunity this was and with the combined rejections it is so dam difficult to keep going.Idk I think this is more of a rant but when I had previous rejections I attributed it to an underwhelming round somewhere but now I have absolutely no idea what to do and figure out where I am lacking.How do you guys deal with big rejections?

        "content": "I'm a web dev with over 10 years experience in a number of different languages, when jobs changed so did tech stack; I can give a little context to each one. C/C++: my weakest of the languages used it professionally for 8 months on a legacy backend system with many layers of contractor crap. It was my first job out of college, and it was hard I was over my head and lost in the sauce. I would say I know this language 1/10 Java: I've worked with this on and off for a number of years, ironically always with spring framework, know it decently well in terms of usage, would need to brush up on multithreading/concurrency, have used SpringThreadExecutor in the past for big batch jobs. I would say I know this language 8/10Golang: I've used this on and off too but not as much or as deeply as Java usually in a microservice context and didn't do any concurrent programming with it but does look a lot nice to work with in that context than the others. It's been sometime since I used this. I would say I know this language 5/10PHP: I used this for a couple of years as old job had a monolith, I actually didn't mind this language and was really easy to pick up, no concurrency or like just a straight crud app with a LAMP stack. I would say I know this language 5/10Python: Used for some scripts, Advent of Code and leetcode job interview questions fun way to use and nice that its closest to pseudo code yeah spacing can be annoying but overall, I liked it. I would say I know this language 5 maybe 6/10JavaScript: Used it for a couple of years from what i remember it was promise chain hell, have done some stuff with it recently on a full stack node.js app but it has so much crap on top I am not a fan, I tend to almost write Java like code in Javascript. I would say I know this language 3/10 I really want to get a deeper knowledge of one of these languages and make it my main one, I feel almost a tie between C/Python/Golang. C for just sheer simplicity I'm sure it will be segfaults out the ass in the beginning but would be fun to get that low level and just be me talking to the computer's memory, then again it may break me. Could open opportunities for hardware or os programming.Python I feel fast and free with this language, just having to remember at times when func params are copied etc. Fast to work with but many others have called it slow, also nice that it's the default language of AI so very versatile. Golang easier use of pointers and mem management, simplified concurrency programming, I haven't done much beyond crud so hard to know just how efficient this language could be if I go a little deeper. Also seems that lots of jobs openings.Sorry if this post is a little rambley I'm just out of work and wanting to enjoy programming again for fun, so just thinking aloud. If you made it this far thank you would love to hear your opinions/takes and even fun projects within each language?",

I've been offered a role at a startup that wants me to be UK-based but they don't have their sponsorship license and aren't rushing to get it. They think the process will take 2-3 months.So, they want me to start as a US-based contractor. Problem is, they're only offering me $8,333/month. That barely covers my costs, let alone they expect me to pay for the visa (almost $7k) and they expect me to pay my own travel back and forth for their monthly in-person in London (they said they'd pay my flights in the interview).I pushed back and they offered $10k/mo, but this is still so low. I had been excited to work there, the UK salary they're offering is decent, but this is just demoralizing. I'll basically have to dip into my savings to work for them, they don't seem to understand the costs that a contractor incurs. The CEO gave some chat about bootstrapping it with limited cashflow, but it's a spinoff from an existing company that's been around for 70 years, so unless he has mismanaged that company they should be able to offer decent comp.Also, they were aware from when I started interviewing in July that I would not be based fulltime in London due to my caring responsibilities in California. I don't even have a flat in London at the minute. They said they'd cover flights and I'd cover accommodation. The market is bad so okay. But I have my mom's dog to care for in California and I live an 8 hour drive from a big airport, so I need parking or an uber from a relative's house or something -- essentially getting to/from airports will cost as much as an economy flight. The UK salary offered is 80k, which will seem low here but trust me, it's not bad. I don't have a ton of experience.That's the other weird thing, I don't have a ton of experience, but they think I'll be fine in essentially a CTO role for this startup. I'm the sole SWE. So on the one hand 80k GBP is not horrible in the UK for my experience level; on the other hand given the amount of responsibility it is low.But anyways, the main issue is what to do about the lowball contractor rate for California. I can't afford to live on that and fly to London and pay the visa. They could get the visa sponsorship in 10 days, but they're not willing to rush, so I'm essentially eating that cost while they dilly dally.But the market is so crap and I don't have much experience so I feel I have to take it. Any advice would be super welcome. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place.",

Like Next.js, Tailwind, Zustard, React Query etc. I've ended up learning a lot more than I intended to try and make sure I can make some portfolio pieces that more closely resemble what a real app might actually be using.My problem is that these frameworks make things easier and I am unsure if that means I am effectively missing some fundamentals because its making it easier for me, and that I should try to use them less. Or do you think it doesn't really matter?It's kind of like the AI argument where if AI makes it all then it means I haven't really made it myself, just to a lesser extent. But it also seems silly to make it harder for myself if that's not how it would really be in an actual job.The job listings in my area don't specifically mention what framworks/libraries they use but I wouldn't really expect them to either. And at the same time I'd be surprised if they didn't use them as well but there are also so many different frameworks and options that I feel there is a decent chance that whatever I use, wherever I eventually get a job might use completely different ones.So my question is, should I try to keep to just kind of 'pure' React, Node, etc or do you think it doesn't really matter to be using these frameworks/libraries?",

        "author": "pailhead011",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’ve been working for 10 years as a software engineer and I feel stuck. I have a degree in architecture (but never worked as an architect) and I did 3d art professionally for almost 15 years prior to making the switch.I was basically aiming to become a technical artist by adding some coding skills, but overshot it, first becoming a “creative technologist” and then landing a software engineering role. Since then, I worked exclusively for startups, most of which folded. By the time I realized I should have been applying for big companies, the layoffs started happening. Most of my roles revolved around WebGL which feels like a really weird niche. I don’t really consider myself a graphics engineer, but I do work a lot with shaders, GPGPU stuff, can read some whitepapers and such. I have some vague understanding of how GPUs work, but not enough to understand cache coherence, never worked with geometry shaders etc. WebGL felt like a path of least resistance - there’s no need to understand compute shaders when they don’t exist. Also, what these “cloud viewers” need, usually isn’t that advanced, one can get a lot of mileage by just knowing how to write shaders and understanding what draw calls are. So instead of growing in that direction and trying to become a bonafide graphics engineer, I thought that it would be easier and better to become a front end engineer that has some graphics chops.I’m not entirely sure if I succeed at this. I’ve had a job where I was mentoring people on react and typescript in addition to doing graphics, was making architecture decisions and such. I’ve had one where I made a Final Cut Pro clone with react. But ive also had some where I’d get laid off once the graphics need was gone, and there were other dedicated FE engineers. I think because 3D meshes may feel alien to a backend/full stack engineer, i ended up doing some computational geometry as well. But again like WebGL, what I did felt amateurish - it did the job, but was typescript, not c++ or rust. Sometimes it would run in the browser, sometimes in node, but far from using something like open cascade. As in, I wasn’t able to combine mature systems in a serious language. But I was able to implement my own half edges, quadtree and such, surgically, to solve a problem. I’d grind leetcode and do well in interviews, which is how I landed my best jobs, but this seems like it’s over now. I did poorly at an AI interview earlier this year. Obviously this is all IC type of stuff, which I do like, but I’ve been exposed to different management styles. Some times it was a free for all, no code reviews, anyone can nuke the master branch, no standup, no retro, just me and my CEO sitting side by side, while our CTO is missing in action. Other times it was really anal agile for the sake of being agile. My favorite situation was when a place that lacked structure got a very good technical program manager. She introduced processes gradually, each time outlining what we were struggling with and then offering a solution. This got me interested in management in general, but I wasn’t able to really pick up much. I worked with some engineers who transitioned to managers, and they were just way more on top of these things. Worked with some that remained ICs but were still super organized. I am lucky to be employed atm and I actually really like my job. If all goes well I may just get unstuck on my own. But having been through the grinder, and since this is another startup, I may be back to where I started. So, what can I do to be employable in the next ten years, even better, to thrive?If I were to leverage my architectural background, how could I do that? By far the two shittiest jobs that I had were in two construction tech startups. I’m still not sure what happened there, I thought I’d bring some domain knowledge to the table, in addition to useful coding skills, it didn’t happen. Is there anything that the 3d art is good for? I feel like the ship for this has sailed 10 years ago. I had a massive imposter syndrome after my first creative technologist job. I did not reach out to my bosses friend who worked at META, and instead bent over backwards to land a job as a FE engineer. I recently saw a talk by this lady who was a UX designer there, where she says how she has no idea how she got hired there in the first place as a graphics designer. 10 years ago I met a person at a hackathon in SF, same profile - a 3d artist looking to break into tech. I don’t think they ever became a software engineer, but maybe even better - a VR evangelist for Mozilla.How could I utilize this if at all? Go “by the way, I have an eye for color and composition”? “I can speak the same language as both your 3d artists and your engineers”? Who am I even trying to convince here, a 20yo CEO probably doesn’t care about some 3d renderings from 20 years ago no matter how good they were for the time?Maybe just pick up figma and say “look I do UX/UI too”?If I were to put all my money on the IC path, what should I focus on? More graphics? More web (full stack)? Try to become an expert on rust?What about going back to school, what field would even make sense?Sorry about the stream of consciousness.",

So, assuming that I have 2+ years of experience and tailor my resume to match the posting (i.e. the resume part of the equation is solved), what, in your opinion, should be my biggest priority to solve the approach side? 1. Apply to hundreds of postings with a tailored resume? 2. Leveraging my network of devs for referrals (does it matter if there is an open position or not)? 3. Leveraging my network of recruiters/hiring managers to try to set up an interview (does it matter if there is an open position or not)?4. Try to cold call you to sell myself on an interview?5. Other?

        "content": "I think I first start to get into programing was when I was 10? Using some Pascal IDE on my old Windows XP (I'm not that old at all, just grew up poor), that I hacked together from parts of all the other broken computers I had.I always loved to fix things, break things, then fix them again. Computers and programming is actually what got me into fixing other things. Electronics, then cars, then I even started building stuff (like carpentry). I guess it sort of inspired me to be a \"life long learner\".For work as a teen, I went towards anything where you could fix stuff, or solve a problem people had. So I worked as a trades assistant in a variety of differrnt trades, and a machine operator until I had the money to go university to study CS, with the idea that this was going to be it for me as this as what I'd *always* done.What I noticed along the way with study is my urge to code in my own time wained as I studied. As well as this, I guess particularly in the last 10 years, I've developed a general disinterest in tech advancements and new software. To be honest, I resent a lot of it, because most of the stuff I inevitably have to use feels convoluted, old reddit > new reddit, type thing. Now that I do have some work experience I've realized one important thing I never considered:**Problem solving in the realm of software development is nothing like problem solving for yourself, or small clients** If I fix a thing for a client (as a tradesman), it's immediately rewarding. You're helping someone with something they can't provide themselves, and it's usually something they need. It's immediately rewarding (for me).The process of building software for a company, who's problem is they want/need more money, does not provide me with that same sense of reward and satisfaction.Even the whole idea of \"continuous improvement\" irritates me. Constantly changing stuff for the sake of... I'm not really sure? And often in the process, just making the product worse. I guess this is coming off as more a rant, but particularly I wanted to ask has anyone felt the same way, and what did you pivot to?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "As someone with a decent background in UI/UX design and frontend development, I have always wondered why is it so difficult to find open vacancies for these type of hybrid-skill roles, and how well-accepted are they within the industry now with the AI hype that is changing the way developers test and ship new digital products. For the past few years I have had good jobs both as a designer and as a frontend developer, and things seemed to go well for me on both ends (financially and career wise). This year, however –with the surge of AI–, I no longer have a stable job and find myself lost in such a competitive market. I am trying to find ways to stay relevant in this aggressive, quick-changing industry, which has led me to explore new opportunities in other not-so-competitive areas and job positions. So my question for all of you is, why do you think these two roles haven't gained as much visibility yet, and what advice would you give to someone like me who stands right in the middle between design and development, with no formal CS-related education?Thank you for reading.edit: typos",

I have a non-technical bachelors and have been slowly pivoting my career into a data-related role, recently deciding to go back to uni.The CS masters is more general and has modules that are very ai focused, as well as an applied stats module and a machine learning module. The Stats and DS course is exactly what it says on the tin, and is more specialist. I am open to the idea of going for technical jobs like data scientist or more human facing roles like a data consultant. My biggest concern is which would look better to an employer. I know that DS isn't as highly regarded as CS generally speaking, and that DS is very hard to break into with just a masters. So please let me know if DS would be worth my time? And if not, if I was to go down a more human facing route, which would be better? Thank you anyone for your time!",

My former coworker / manager still works there, and I was curious if there was anything wrong with asking them for a reference or just anything that could have improve my chances. I already asked them if they’d be okay with giving me a reference earlier this summer and they agreed, I just didn’t know if it would be weirder if it was for the same company. And if it’s completely fine, how should go about asking them ? Thanks!",

Although I’m still looking for my first job, I am not going to forgo the projects I’m working on just to apply for more jobs in a day since I don’t see how it will help me. Making projects, earning certifications, and building my network gives me a sense of fulfillment that I have never gotten with just putting out more applications. I’m not giving up, and I think not burning myself out trying to put out thousands of applications is helping me stay in there. My best wish is that I can be patient and leverage these real experiences as it all comes together, especially when things eventually get better.",

Then we talked about the details, how much I would get, how the work would be done, what is the stack, etc. We would work remotely but we could work in person if I want. This was a few weeks ago. I asked what is up with this and he told me last week that he would meet with the head of the company that was giving the project to go over the details, like when we could start, etc. He said he would reach out to me when there was an update, but nothing so far. He said there are some delays on the company's side.What do you think, should I wait for this because it seems a good opportunity, or does it seem like a lost cause, or am I just being impatient?

Working on something I had the concept for a couple months ago. I cannot stop fantasizing about the project. Listed as remote and pay is significantly higher. I'm tempering my hopes, but I was wondering what the etiquette is on cold-calling a smaller company. Do you DM the founder, just submit a resume, email the company (if they have it), or something else?I have 3 years at a FAANG. Little over 5 years at the company (one of those started in the mailroom stories . Got lucky because the pandemic boom.)",

I've yet to see anyone face any repercussions for being late on any task - generally everyone does tasks in their own time, as long as they dont block other peoples progress, or push the deadline. if need be, usually your superior will ask hows the work on the project you're working on doing, and will give you a date by which a certain part of it needs to be done.they also asked me when i am done with a task in the middle of the work day, do I report it to my superior, and do I then get assigned a task, and of what weight.so my question is, would you consider this question(or the second one) a red flag? ive also been asked this question about a year ago at a web gambling game company, and it also gave me the ick.",
