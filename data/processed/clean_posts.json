Stuff like SELECT \\* or SELECT TOP 7,000,000 \\* with a list of 50 different tables and thousands of fields at once (like 10,000), all joined on non-clustered indexes. And not just one query like this, but tons coming through.Started to look at query plans and calculate algorithmic complexity. Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style. The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.That being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query. This is the same management by the way that signed a deal with a cloud provider and agreed to pay $2million dollars for 2TB of cold log storage lol The rise of Citizen Developers is causing issues where I am, with potentially high future costs.",

        "content": "Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.As an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.Takes from my first project:1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.Example of my worst experience:I tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI. Link to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\\_batch\\_data\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\\*Note\\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)Hope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",

Which is why I'm now targeting more Data Engineer positions. Thing is, when I'm reading job descriptions, I feel discouraged by what's asked as skills.What I know/have/done:* Certified SnowProCore* Certified Alteryx Advanced* Experienced Tableau Analyst * Used extensively PostgreSQL * I know Python, having used it back in the days (and some time to time) but I lost some of it. Mostly used pandas to prepare datasets. I'll need a refresher on this though.* Built a whole backend for a Flutter-based app (also the frontend) using Supabase: designed the schemas, the tables, RLS, Edge Functions, cron jobs (related to the startup I mentionned earlier)* Experience with Git* Have a really low understanding of container with Docker* Currently reading the holy bible that is The fundamentals of Data EngineeringWhat I don't have:* Experience on AWS/Azure/GCP* Spark/Hadoop* Kafka* Airflow* DBT/Databricks* Didn't do a lot of data pipelines* Didn't do a lot of CI/CDand probably more I'm forgetting. I'm a quick learner and love to experiment, but as I want to make sure to be as prepared as possible for job interviews, I'd like to focus on the most important skill that I currently lack.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.But 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. I ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. I’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. I don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it.",

If its relevant, its minute level financial data, each file is for a separate stock/ticker. If I were to put it in a structured SQL database, I'd probably need to filter by ticker and date at some points in time. Can anyone point me in the right direction, it'd be appreciated.",

But I’m starting to worry that this setup might be over-engineered for the current scope. Since there’s only one DAG and the workload is pretty light, I’m concerned this could waste resources and time on configuration that might not be necessary.Has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you think it's worth going through the full Airflow + ECS setup for such a simple pipeline? Or would it make more sense to use a lighter solution for now and scale later if needed?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.When I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).But, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.My hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.Anyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too. TLDR: I'm getting paid 72k with, working 40 hours a week, good benefits, not a ton of stress, 1 year of full time DE experience, should I be looking for more?",

There is no other person working on this besides me and we have only had one meeting so far where the project was described briefly by my manager . Now I'm feeling kind of burnt out as I have no mentor or other engineer helping me through this(infact no mentor at all during this internship). What are the best ways to approach this? Are there any good resources I can use for MS Fabric? The entire platform just feels like its in beta with so many issues and bugs all around.",

I'm thinking about going with the setup suggested in the title - using DLTHub for ingestion pipelines, DBT or SQLMesh for transforming data in the database and Airflow to schedule this. Is this generally speaking a good direction?For some more context: \\- for now the volume of the data is quite low and the frequency of the ingestion is daily at most; \\- I need a strong focus on security and privacy due to the nature of the data; \\- I'm sitting on Azure.And lastly a specific technical question, as I started to implement this solution locally - does anyone have experience with running dlt on Airflow? What's the optimal way to structure the credentials for connections there? For now I specified them in Airflow connections, but then in each Airflow task I need to pull the credentials from the connections and pass them to dlt source and destination, which doesn't make much sense. What's the better option?Thanks!",

I'm pretty sure the lay-off was because they realised if they don't have the product or the data or the money to pay me so why need a DE at all (honestly why keep the company at all).

        "content": "Hello Data Engineers :waving_hand:I've been scouting on the internet for the best and easiest way to setup **dbt Core 1.9.0 with Airflow 3.0** orchestration. I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.I'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. **Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.So let's get started. ## Prerequisites- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)## Video Tutorial{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}## Setup1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. 2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.## Running Airflow Locally1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.## Running dbt Core LocallyCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core```shpython3 -m venv dbt_venvsource dbt_venv/bin/activate```Optional, to create an alias```shalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'```Install dbt Core```shpython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres```Verify Installation```shdbt --version```Create a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users//.dbt` directory and add the following content. ```yamldefault: target: dev outputs: dev: type: postgres host: localhost port: 5432 user: your-postgres-username-here password: your-postgres-password-here dbname: public schema: public```You can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.```shcd dbt/hello_worlddbt compile```## CleanupRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.## FAQs### Generating fernet key```shpython3 -c \"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"```I hope this tutorial was useful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments section. Happy Coding!",

So the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not possible. We have now explored other methods to do \"data exploration\":* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType \"decimal\" (wtf?)* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and configuration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and requires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.For you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit surprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature and widely adopted. Any tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic format? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?A little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the data as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, while using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow are big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability. I know that the Arrow Java Implementation, can , supposedly, deserialize Avro directly into Arrow. But not the C/Python Implementation.",

I don't know if I am doing things the right way. But my use case is to generate vector embeddings for one of the `string` columns (say `a`) in my DataFrame. I also have another vector embedding for a `blacklist`.Now, I when I am generating vector embeddings for `a` I first filter out nulls and certain useless records and generate the embeddings for the remaining of them (say `b`). Then I do a cosine similarity between the embeddings in `b` and `blacklist`. Then I only keep the records with the max similarity.

While using Spark for EDA isn’t a big issue, it becomes more complex when training models with PyTorch, since combining Spark, Iceberg, and PyTorch introduces additional complexity due to the JVM and Python interoperability.In general, when ML/DS teams want to train models (mostly written in Python) using data stored in Iceberg tables, what are the common ways to load that data from Iceberg into their Python(Pytorch, ML) workflows?",

Our past approach to data analytics was extremely primitive, as we pretty much just queried our production OLTP database in SQL Server for all BI purposes (terrible, I know). We are presently modernizing our architecture and have PowerBi Premium licenses for reporting. To get rolling fast, I just replicated our production database to another database on different server and use it for all BI purposes. Unfortunately, because it’s all highly normalized transactional data, we use views with many joins to load fact and dimension tables into PowerBi. We have decided to use Synpase Analytics for data warehousing in order to persist fact and dimension tables and load them faster into PowerBi. I understand Microsoft is moving resources to Fabric, which is still half-baked. Unfortunately, tools like Snowflake or Databricks are not options for our agency, as we are fully committed to a Microsoft stack. Has anyone else faced this scenario? Are there any resources you might recommend for maintaining fact and dimension tables in a dedicated Synapse pool and updating them based on changes to an OLTP database? Thanks much!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.This team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.# The Core Problem:The team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.I’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \\~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.I had some questions1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?This is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",

Now I'm realizing that I'm slowly rotting away at my managerial position since I barely touch code at all. I feel like a glorified babysitter. I want to start relearning Data Engineering, bridge my gaps, and learn how to DE at an advanced level, i.e. proper data modeling design and technique, advanced SQL, etc.Any courses or resources you would recommend?",

We use airflow version 2.10.2.I tried to do my research both in web and with the AI support, and the suggestion was to go with \"Custom Email Backend in Airflow\", meaning to replace the`airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp`with my own function that handles OAuth2.I have created this post because I am looking for advice and some sort of validation whether it is really the best approach, considering the scenario that we would need to still use the Microsoft Office account (and not e.g. gmail). I would really like to make sure that the transition/changes we will be implementing are not in fact introducing some anti-patterns... Is there any better/more clean way of tackling it? Thanks!",

Seems straightforward enough, except that our Qualtrics account has data from other clients and this doesn't need to all be loaded into the lake, only data for the specific surveys for this one client.What would be the recommended approach here?* I see that Fivetran offers DBT, but it uses ELT and all of the source data gets replicated over before the DBT transformations run. So this won't work.* Row filtering is a feature in Fivetran, but only for database sources, not for Qualtrics.I'm thinking we'd need to dump all of the data into our own destination first and then sync across the filtered data to their lake...I suppose this will work, but I'm just looking for ideas in case I can avoid the multi step process.",

Airbyte OSS (self-hosted on EC2)2. Use DLTHub for the 2 pipelines (we already have Airflow set up on an ec2 )3. Use AWS DMS to do MySQL → S3 → Snowflake via Snowpipe.Any thoughts or other ideas? More info: \\*Ideally we would want to use something cloud-based like Airbyte cloud, but we need SSO to meet our security constraints. \\*Our data engineering team is just two people who are both pretty competent with python. \\*Our platform engineering team is 4 people and they would be the ones setting up the ec2 instance and maintaining it (which they already do for airflow).",

What I'm seeing is [continue.dev](http://continue.dev), set up with openAI embeddings provider, and VoyageAI re-ranking, with settings set to retrieve 25 results and re-rank down to 5, often gives me fewer than 5 context items when I search the codebase in this manner, and usually the majority of context items chunks it comes back with as relevant are just totally not. Like the license agreement in the repo or something silly like that, which have nothing to do with the \"semantic meaning\" of my question.Maybe I just need to set up a comparison and see if it's something about my [continue.dev](http://continue.dev) setup, or not. But I can see both the embeddings API and re-ranker are getting called when I use the tool, so it seems to be \"working\" at the most basic level.But man, it's next to useless.Is this what you all tend to see with these \"do retrieval on your codebase\" tools? And I realize it's only good for certain things, and a bad prompt will mean bad result, and sometimes cntl-f is what you really want, but it just seem so bad even when my question/prompt is pretty specific about things I know are verbatim in the codebase mutiple places.",

        "content": "Hi. This is purely a pedantic question, with no practical impact on what is being developed. But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.We have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. Now, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually \"loading\" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. So, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline). Is it neither of them, or some other Jargon I don't know about?",

Stretching on the is good?Hi everyone,My wife and I live in the SF Bay Area. She grew up in Middle East and moved here after our marriage. Back there, she worked for one of the top employers, but here she’s struggling to get calls from tier 1 (FAANG) or tier 2 (just below FAANG) companies — or sometimes even tier 3.She has a BS in Computer Science and currently a senior data analyst. She’s genuinely smart and extremely good at what she does — honestly, she’s smarter than me in most ways!She wants to move from data analytics into data engineering, but as you all know, the required skill sets are different — pipelines, cloud, distributed systems, ETL frameworks, etc.Here’s where we differ: I came to the US for my master’s and I’m more of a hustler. I stretch my skills a lot to match the job description — for example, I highlight skills I may not be an expert in but know enough to talk about, just to get calls and clear interviews. Then I prep like crazy to bridge any gaps. She, on the other hand, doesn’t want to do that — she feels it’s dishonest and wants to break in purely on what she’s actually done.So my question is: what’s the best honest path for her to break into a tier 1 or tier 2 company as a data engineer? Can anyone tell her it’s good to stretch the skill setsIf anyone here has made this switch (without a US degree), we’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, resources, or realistic tips to help her get her foot in the door in tier1 or tier2 companies with or without lying on her would mean a lot.Thanks so much in advance!",

From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.We’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve This way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.We’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another \"imagined problem\".Would love to hear your thoughts:* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?Any perspectives would be appreciated!",

Our main upstream is RDS (planning to use DMS for CDC) and some APIs/files, and the main downstream is analytics and external reportingHere’s what we’re planning to do:Using Spark-based processing with Iceberg as staging.DMS captures CDC data from RDS to S3.A custom Glue Spark + Lambda ingestion framework loads data from S3 to Iceberg.We then apply transformations in Glue and load curated data to Redshift.The reason for this approach was individual scalability and familiarity with Spark.However, I recently came across Zero ETL in Redshift, which seems to simplify things:CDC data directly stages into Redshift.We can then use DBT for transformations and create curated models within Redshift itself.Given that:We currently have GBs of data but expect it to grow significantly.Our team is comfortable with Spark/Glue.Which approach would be better for long-term scalability and manageability?Would Zero ETL with DBT simplify infra and reduce cost/complexity, or does the Spark + Iceberg route give more flexibility for future multi-destination use cases?Any insights from your team’s experience with similar setups would be very helpful.Thanks in advance!",

The goal is to ingest the data into snowflake from various sources. For this first pipeline here is a simplified process: 1. File is uploaded in SharePoint Folder to be ingested 2. File is picked up and split into csv's based on sheet names (Using Python presumably)3. Those CSVs are then uploaded into Snowflake Tables4. Once in Snowflake I will trigger tasks that transform and get the data where we want it (This I've already mostly figured out). We have been leaning towards Azure Data Factory for our data pipelines as the basics are already set up but I seem to be having issues figuring out a reliable source for running python in ADF. I have seen stuff from Azure Functions and Batch Processing (which I have little experience configuring and setting up). Another solution would be to just migrate to a full python approach with Apache Airflow but that would be another system to configure... I would love assistance on how people use ADF and Python or if I should be thinking in a different way for these pipelines. Any assistance or thoughts is greatly appreciated!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am considering database CI/CD frameworks for a long term project to handle database evolution eloquently. At my place of work, it's pretty common to just spin up at a database and have an admin make ad-hoc changes to create/modify users, permissions, schemas, tables, etc. (if you're lucky, they commit those changes to a repo). This generally doesn't pose any issues when we expect the life-cycle of the project to be a matter of months-- and it helps us move quick when we have a crunched deadline and a smallish team, reduces overhead/red tape, but scrappy. For reference, these are generally analytic databases, not hooked up to any downstream application, save for a dashboard here or there. Our products are generally processed data itself or research derived from that data. The downsides to this scrappy database approach is the one prod environment can become messy, the admin might not always remember to commit ddl changes to version control, and if a dev is creating stored procs or something, that is likely going to fly under the radar of source/version control. Ultimately it can become hard to maintain and hard to appropriately gatekeep and record what changes are made when. So I come with a question for those of you that use flyway, liquibase, atlas, dbmate or any similar tools: How has it made your life easier/harder? How do you get buy-in from your teams? Feel free to note anything else about using these tools that feels relevant.",

        "author": "cheyyne",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.The actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.The game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.And that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.A large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate \"Smart Supply\" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.Anyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*So I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.Anyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun! Happy coding!",

I personally love it and have legitimately found that it has changed my career trajectory for the better. So many advanced concepts felt clear only when I learned Haskell. Most notably concurrent programming. I also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? Yet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the \"pythonic\" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes \"how come you dont know OOP\" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. Ive also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.",

Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.I just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.I see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like \"which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,\" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of \"software engineering\" or development.I bet most of us were stuck in \"language hell\" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.Language is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type \"xyz language syntax/libraries,\" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.If language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.So you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on \"how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?\"When you list your languages in your CV like this:* C & C++* Java* Python* Haskell* Verilog* so onyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer \"Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?\" or \"Which boards did you work on?\" or \"Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?\" or \"Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?\"The other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.The more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the \"specialization.\" Let's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.So rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those. This approach will teach you the necessary language and engineering skills at the same time.",

But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?I think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.Personally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.Anyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was.

Honestly looking back, my stuff was pretty much cobbled together from Stack Overflow - but they worked at the time, and I genuinely enjoyed making them.Well, that lasted until a couple years ago when some shit hit the fan around high school grad age.

        "content": "tl;dr feel burnt out, and trouble focusing, self-studying at 30Hey all, im self-taught mostly over the past 4 years. I've learnt a lot mostly on random topics etc. At first i was just doing it as a side-thing in case i *enjoyed it*. And i quickly found i did, i loved to create and solve problems, research, debug and refactor, the whole lot. The issue was, i never planned to go to University/College. I didn't think the career path would be for me. Until recently (earlier this year) when i began to actively try and get a job (which is almost impossible for me). So i decided while i wait, i study core compsci topics that i missed out.I did a bit of random study all over the place (like with roadmap.sh and random lectures/tutorials). Until i heard of OSSU. It's great... but at the same time, my attention is just so lacking at my age, i feel like 10+ years ago i would have loved studying like this, but now? It feels so tiresome and tiring. It probably doesn't help that 1. I'm cramming as much as i can2. The topics so far are all things I've already learnt. But i just really want to be able to say \"Hey, i know i dont have a degree, but i did this online pathway!\"There are many reasons i initially didn't go for a degree (health and finances being the main two). But now I'm kinda glad i didnt? I don't know if i could have dredged on for 4 years like this, i very much just want the next 6-12months to fly by (my estimated finish time for OSSU). So that i can just focus on increasing my portfolio.But yeah, wondering if anyone has been in the same boat? Studying later in life.",

I don’t have a job, I’m not working in any company, and this project meant the world to me.Right now, I feel lost and defeated. I feel like I lost my motivation and passion completely.Please...

Along with this I am also studying nextjs for SEO which react lacks in. It feels like I have put so much effort into learning all this because I know a lot of people who don’t even code outside uni despite having a passion for cs. But at the same time there are students who I work with at uni who feel so much more ahead of me and much more prepared for this industry. Yes I know comparison is the theft of joy. But I feel like it’s just unavoidable. At the same time with all the LLMs going around and vibe coding, I see students who vibe code websites under a day which would take me at least a few days to create all while them not even having a grasp of what the code is about. So it really defeats the purpose of putting all that effort into studying all that. What would you do this in my situation?

I don't really understand how it works but the fact that you could make, apps, websites, or even programming a robot. It really blows my mind. I've decided I start on my own coding journey before I invest in some kind of course. Now finding this page and reading the beginners FAQ I understand the best way to start is with a problem I'm interested in solving. The problem is I don't even know what kind of problem I can solve using coding. I also don't want to jump into something super advanced with out knowing and end up discourage.My question is this, what are the problems that you guys solved with coding when you first started?

My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.I’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.I find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation? I’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(Every field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.I jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",

But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.****Warning: wall of text.**I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.I started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.Also, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.Over time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.With how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet. I'm still afraid to apply for senior roles.",

I always let ai generate me problems for every topic I learn but somehow im stuck at every for loop problems it gives me, and its even the basic ones.Any advice for me out there to learn for loops easier? Is this just a genuine beginner problem? For context: Im learning plain C.",

        "author": "franzz4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.After learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?** From what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:* Python* Java* C#* Go* RustI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "As the title states, I would call myself a C++ programmer because it’s the main language I use. Of course, there are others I use, like C, Java, TS, python, etc. but I have stuck to C++ for so long because after graduating (I’m in my final year of CS bachelors), I want to work in systems programming/high performance systems programming (particularly computer graphics). As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc. But, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases. Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong. Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it. No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.Of course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on. My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff. I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff. But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with itSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++? Or is there a good alternative to C++?",

It’s not a hardware problem — it’s a fresh, high-spec laptop.

I can make APIs and I understand HTTP to a good extent and all that stuff, I can make CRUD APIs if I wanted. But I also have this itch to make more complex projects, things that will teach me more than just language or library features. For example, I want to try to make a mini Express.js with the Node HTTP module, but when I try to think of how I would even start this project my mind just goes blank. I feel like I should know this, but I don't.I've been building APIs in raw Node.js, so I think I should at least be able to come up with some sort of abstraction around the HTTP module, kind of like what express does with app.get() and more. But for some reason, I can't. It's like I can understand HTTP, custom middleware, routing, and serving static files, but when I want to make something a step-up from basic CRUD APIs, I feel like I'm back to square one and I actually haven't learned anything. And it isn't just about this project, it's in general. For example, if I go to the \"Project based learning\" github repo and check out the Node section, it says things like \"Build a real-time Markdown editor in Node.js\", \"build a web framework\", \"build a real-time serverless GraphQL API with WebSockets on AWS\". I feel like I should maybe have SOME idea as to what things I would need to do, but I can't even think of one and if I do then I'll realize it's not a perfect solution and then I have to go back and think about it.

Is there ANY way to make this less ugly? Again, I'm more of a backend kind of person, so don't go too hard on me for how ugly this is. I'm only building a front-end so I can do more than just CLI. Any tips?",

They had okay answers to initial questions, but none could speak at any depth in follow up questions.So let’s say I’m interviewing you. I can see you reading your responses off a screen, and you know what… that’s fine. You maybe had some canned answers ready.I ask you follow up questions and you need a minute to think, that’s great. Take your time. I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.But if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question. If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice. If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.In short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion. But people who have actual skills and experiences can go from pleasant high-level summaries down several layers into explaining the details of what they understand. Solving a difficult bug leaves a mark on your soul you don’t forget the details. If I get a word salad of tech jargon as an answer, and every follow up question is a new word salad of jargon, i can’t hire you, because you give me nothing to work with.I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you want to interview successfully you need to be able to speak coherently like a human about your own choices.",

I am not new to this field and even with that I am just tired of this field.I felt it might get better, but I feel it has only gotten worse. Started in this field a little before COVID hit and heard that is when things started going downhill in this field (outside that window of massive hiring for 1.5 year) around then. My experience backs this.The expectations in this field are insane and none of my friends in other fields come close to putting up with this. The interview process is out of control and much of it has nothing to do with on the job stuff. So you have to learn on your own these things to do the interviews. The expectations while you have a job are insane. You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.Also, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create \"another language\" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.Nevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.Ultimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out. I just don't see a future in this field anymore.What are some realistic paths I can take to get out of this field given my CS degree and experience? I'm ok with going back to school or pay for some training if it means there is a realistic path to getting employment. As long as it won't take more than 2 years. Ideally 1 year. Open to any idea though. I'm ok taking a paycut too, anything in 80k-100k pay range is ok with me.I'm just over it. What are my options? Does anyone have any suggestions?",

Surely there's a point at which the sponge can not be wrung any further.What's their plan to make the \"big number go up\" with no growth and nowhere else to make people cuts?

(I quit for various reasons.) I considered myself a mid-level dev at this point. According to my superiors, I did an excellent job throughout. Upon re-entering the job market, I blew through my savings while adding 9 Google Certifications, with no success.

I genuinely thought I had job security because my company never had a mass layoff, well I was wrong. My entire team of 14 people were laid off. 2 of my ex teammate got a job within a month. 1 went back to their old company and another had a referral. No updates from the other 12..I cold apply for over 3 weeks and did not hear anything back until an ex coworker reached out to me randomly about an opening at her company. I went through 3 interviews and was ghosted but it gave me the idea to reach out to my old contacts. I reached out to a few old contacts and a manager, whom I met ONCE in a meeting. He ended up referring me to a consulting firm. I went through one 30 minutes interview and ended with an offer 30k above my old job. I am genuinely baffled because I feel like I didn't do well in the interview. For months, I spent countless hours tailoring my resume and cover letters for each application to end up with an offer that I didn't even need to formally apply to. I feel incredibly grateful but it just makes me sad that life is truly about who you know, and not how capable you are.

After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.Prior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.In conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say \"oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here.\" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. There are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).Regardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. I'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc? Are there companies that I should be looking at? Anyway, thanks for listening and for any feedback or advice you can offer. Best of luck out there on your interview loops!",

Based on convos with the teams, WLB at Google should be solid for the foreseeable future. WLB @ Meta should be comparable for the first year or so, but it sounds like on-call could get rough after that (specifically the on-call severity may worsen next year).Complicating things, I’ve already signed with Meta. Would need to back out if I take the Google offer, which I’m hesitant about due to potential reputational damage.Would appreciate any insight, especially from folks who’ve been in similar situations.",

I also did an unpaid internship after second year of college where I didn’t learn anything.

My current job is software support being crosstrained in development, so i’m not even truly into development yet but I still get stressed out regardless. The client end of things is a lot to deal with.For so many students and post I know, they are spending so much time on side projects and slowly giving themselves anxiety by spending all their time not studying or working by grinding, I tell them to go out and do things with people they like. For me, when I get a good reset, I get more productive. I am not someone who can just go on and on, although I know some who can. I’ve also seen people lose really good friends by losing themselves in the grind. Wouldn’t recommend it.",

The work is more niche (GPU driver, kernel debugging).* Option 2: Higher paid position at a different company where I'd be working on a modern C++ codebase (the company is smaller and isn't as well known but the staff is apparently quite elite). After one year they allow remote work + give a significant raise in salary.The key issue here is that the first role is almost exclusively focused on debugging driver/GPU issues and there is little to no implementation to be done. I imagine that I would become something of a linux kernel / GPU driver guru after some time of doing this kind of work.The other role pays better (especially after the one year re-negotiation) and allows for remote work but it's more of a regular C++ SWE engineering implementation job, after a year this would be \\~45k euro at google (net of tax) vs \\~75k euro (net of tax) at the other company.My two questions to people who have experience in the industry are:1. Would having google in my CV have a significant impact on my career compared to experience at some other company?2. Could doing no implementation and essentially only debugging be dertimental to my engineering skills or actually help me grow? I will add that I already know C++ pretty well so I don't believe I could grow all that much in terms of pure C++ skills.I would really appreciate some input.",

Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve. I'm stagnating, and have been for a while.The problem is that I need to make more money. And I don't know where to start. I'm looking for other roles but I'm getting no bites. I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews. But I did flop the ones I got, other than my current job, of course. Now, the question is this: if I want FAANG to look at my resume a year from now, what do I have to do? Hell, it doesn't even have to be FAANG. Any tech company would be enough. Or even any reputable company even. How can I save myself from being out of a job in a year and having to spend 6 months looking for another one?",

I would say nearly every single sprint, we have the wrong amount of work for the developers on our team. We never have enough work for the 10 work days of the sprint, and whenever any of the devs bring up pulling in new work, it's met with \"well, if we pull something in, odds are we won't get it completed by the time the sprint ends.\" from the Scrum Master and PO. So, the solution is to do research or some bullshit security training that's required every year until the sprint ends, essentially wasting 2-3 days a sprint.I have worked here since graduating college (<5 years), get paid (\\~85k / year, no bonus, no stock), and have good benefits (unlimited PTO, fully remote).That being said, I feel like my skills have been degrading year after year, and I'm really fed up with the red tape of this job. The work I complete has been basically the exact same for my entire time here, and having to spend 5-10 days a month \"doing my own research\" is not helping.

Maybe the fact most of my degree was getting stuck 30-60 minutes on each exercise and then seeing the solution; maybe I just don't have a passion for the field, and I thought I'd get to ignite it; maybe I'm a little bitch. If I may get a job, I probably won't enjoy it. Actually, I don't even know what field I want to get into.

Essential I’d receive 6 months of salary as severance. I’m a mid-level SWE with only 2 years of experience. I like my current team, but there is little to no room for growth here.What’s pushing me to seriously consider the offer is that there might very likely be an involuntary layoff coming later and the severance for those is roughly 2 months of salary.My main concern is: What if I can’t find a new job within 6 months? The market feels shaky, and I’m not sure how long the job search might take, especially given my relatively short experience.Has anyone been in a similar position? Would you take the package, or is it too risky right now? What factors should I weigh before making a decision?Edit: If I do take the package, my plan is to grind Leetcode full-time and look for a better role. I’ve already been preparing the last few months after realizing there’s really no path for promotion here and there was already 1 round of layoff happened earlier this year. That said, I’ve been inconsistent due to my full-time workload. Taking the package feels like a rare opportunity to fully focus on job hunting and leveling up, but I’m still nervous about the risk of not landing a new role within 6 months.",

The demos made it look like you’d just write a prompt and it would crank out production-ready code with perfect architecture. Even our CTO was pushing us to “experiment aggressively.”And sure sometimes it does help. Boilerplate, tests, refactors I’m too lazy to do at 11 PM. No complaints there.But for real design or new features? It’s like pair programming with an overeager intern who refuses to say “I don’t know.” It’ll confidently scaffold something that compiles but is subtly wrong in ways that bite you later. Error handling missing. Boundaries between services fuzzy. Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.It’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.I’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. Anyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc. I’m not anti-AI. It’s staying in my toolbox. But I’m starting to treat it more like Stack Overflow: amazing for hints, dangerous for blind copy-paste.Would love to hear how others are using it day-to-day, especially in non-trivial codebases.",

Probably as what many have experienced, the job search/market has been terrible and I haven't been able to get very much in terms of interviews with cold applications. I've read a lot that networking right now is probably the best way to get interviews but what's the best way to go about that. The current company I work for is pretty small so we don't have many connections outside the company. Would I just connect with random people on LinkedIn with hopes of landing something? Any tips? Thank you so much",

I called their office, cell, and their HR desk (they were about as helpful as they could be, I think). Never heard back.I'm a hard worker, I spend all of my free time coding, tinkering, and reading on CS/EE/math topics, I am very active on GitHub and even have some YouTube videos demonstrating my ability. I feel like I'm doing everything right and still have made no progress in my job search. Surely it's just bad luck? Or is the job market really just... that bad?",

        "content": "I'm 48 years old in the USA and wondering if it's too late for a career change. I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. The good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.The bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email. I am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how \"real\" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.I plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long. So I guess I'm in that phase where I feel too old and outdated to do anything else but still too young to retire... but doing nothing is becoming scarier by the day.",

But in the process, I feel like my career and education have taken such a massive hit. I was always a very type-A person: I planned things out, I learned methodically, I loved doing things properly and building deep understanding. But when your time and your body aren’t your own anymore — when you're constantly dealing with pain and medical stuff you never asked for — it just changes everything.I feel like I’m a much less qualified student and engineer than I know I’m capable of being. And that kills me. Because I can't imagine being anything other than someone who's good at what they do. And right now, I’m not. And it’s not because I don’t care or didn’t work hard — it’s just everything else that’s been in the way.Other than the constant worry about how I’ll get placed or find a job, the bigger fear is: how am I going to keep up? How am I going to keep learning and growing in this field when even just showing up is so damn hard sometimes?So, yeah — I just need to know: are there others like me? People who’ve had this kind of physical and mental burden and still built successful, competitive careers in CS or tech? I need to know it’s possible.",

For one out of every 4 weeks, I can’t go out to dinner, I can’t go to a concert, I can’t have a few drinks, and I can’t go do fun weekend activities, because I have to be within 15-30 minutes of a response time in the unlikely event that something goes wrong.Usually, everything is fine, and there are no issues.

Every framework or library we produce aims to reduce the amount of work we have to spend to achieve some result.The western world represents 15-20% of the population, and we can imagine the remaining 80% catching up will keep on producing more and more engineers as years go by, especially as long as IT is considered the holy grail of sure employment and high pay.With software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ?

I have about 1-2Y of \"work\" experience if I really had to average it out with internships+all the side projects etc. No degree either, only an associates. But I completely crashed out at the last job and burned lots of bridges to the point where I can't use them on my resume (and it was my biggest experience) so its effectively over + I now have a 2Y gap on the resume. I'm not THAT good of a coder either if I'm being honest but hey if I can get the ball rolling for someone else to build off of, that's good enough for me. Are there any veterinary charities that need better software? Social support groups? Im looking for causes that specifically will get zero support cause there's no money to be made but people to be helped like IDK autism kids management or logistical software for some specific condition that like 100 kids have or some shit.

What would be the best move or pivot for me? I know Power Bi, Power Apps, Power Automate, SQL, Sharepoint, Dataverse, and of course I know my coding languages too like Python, JavaScript, etc. I was thinking of getting BA knowledge on the side and pivoting to technical BA which has a lot of growth and good pay. I just need some guidance. Maybe it would be best to just take another entry level job and start fresh. Right now, it feels like I’m at a dead end and my client won’t let me go which sadly means most of my time is taken up by power platform development",

I have created Data Engineering projects where data is extracted, loaded and transformed. I chose data engineering because it was a topic that interested me, it was my introduction to programming in general and my workplace had data engineers. However, in order to bring life to my project and take it out of the database I have been teaching myself Flask in order to create a basic website. Right now I am kind of at a crossroads. I can either finish my basic webpage and focus my energy on deepening my data engineering skills and knowledge (e.g. learning Spark, NoSQL, Kafka, Snowflake, practicing SQL more etc.) or expand my frontend skills and knowledge (e.g. learning Javascript, Typescript, and frontend framework such as React).I ask because I am starting a graduate program (Msc Computer Science conversion) but I will still likely need to build these skills in my own time, but I'll definitely have limited time and won't be able to do both.I also ask because while I find DE very interesting and engaging, I understand that DE isn't something people do right after graduating as it is quite niche and it takes a few years experience either being an analyst or a SWE.My goal is to develop the skills to maximize my chances of employability.Help me help myself Thanks!",

During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a \"Hochschule\" that costs 19k€).The thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.From a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.I'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the \"proper\" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the \"academic proof\" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.Anyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out? Would love to hear thoughts from both hiring managers and developers who've taken either path.Thanks!",

Can you recommend something, either for just React for now, or for React + Node? I was thinking of anything I can complete within a few weeks, ideally not much more than that.So far I've been considering Meta's [React Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-react-specialization) on Coursera, or maybe IBM's [JavaScript Programming with React, Node & MongoDB Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/javascript-programming-with-react-node-mongodb?specialization=meta-front-end-developer), also on Coursera. Someone else on a different subreddit recommended the [Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, which looks comprehensive and touches many modern technologies I am not familiar with, but which could be overkill for someone who is already a developer, I guess.Please, I know it might be a boring question, but can you please offer some guidance? Again, what I want is:* Learning about React and Node (or, first one thing and then the other one) * A reputable certificate to add to my resume and Linkedin profile * Ideally, an endeavor that requires not more than a few weeks (a couple of months would be my absolute max)",

        "content": "hello, I am an incoming junior at a T30 looking to get into the SWE/DE space. I recently changed my major from chemistry to math, and i have spent this summer catching up on classes for my major. I have a 3.33 GPA right now, but that’s gonna go up ( hopefully). Right now i know basic python ( functions, for loops, numpy, matplotlib, dictionaries, etc). in other words, a beginner. So my question is as follows: given that i will have to teach myself the CS fundamentals, what’s the best path to take? What languages do I need to know, and what resources would you recommend to effectively learn them? As for projects, after my class is done, i will create a LA calculator and a mass-spring model( differential equations). This will integrate my math knowledge with coding, and will be good for me to put on GitHub. Beyond that, i know there’s Leetcode, which is good because i learn best by doing practice problems. My stretch goal is to get a summer 2026 internship in CS, no matter how small. I know that since i’m late to the party, i will have to start small. this is fine by me, i just need my foot in the door. Is this realistic? any advice from someone who was in my shoes? sorry for the stream of consciousness writing…",

        "content": "Hi all,I am weighing two very different paths and could use an outside perspective.# Option 1: Stay in Dubai, keep the data job, enroll in Penn’s online AI certificate (with a strong chance of rolling into the MSE AI)* **Role:** Data Science / Business Analyst at a big energy company* **Pay:** ≈ $50 k, untaxed, since I would live with my parents and have next to no expenses* **Work:** Mostly dashboards, data refreshes, and business reports; there is talk of automation and LLM projects but nothing concrete yet, and the team is not technical* **Perks:** Comfortable schedule, spare time for side projects, steady cash flow to fund courses or conferences* **Concern:** Little real coding means I might get boxed into BI work. Don't really like the job and my team isn't technical at all.# Option 2: Move to Canada for Waterloo’s in-person MEng (includes a co-op term)* **Cost:** Tuition plus rent and living costs in Waterloo, so I would burn savings (but I can afford it)* **Upside:** Waterloo’s name carries weight, and the co-op cycle should drop me into genuine dev roles and help me build a network in Canadian tech* **Downside:** Two years of full-time study at age 24, plus the chance I still end up fighting for the same entry-level SWE spots afterward. And the job market is not great so it's a risk.# About me* Canadian citizen, CS undergrad (was originally in DS and had my internships in that)* Part-time work with two early-stage US startups* Contributing to AI research in my spare hours to bulk up the résumé* Goal: Land a software engineering job in Canada or the US within the next couple of years# Anything else I should weigh before picking comfort now versus a riskier move that might unlock better opportunities later?**What would you do if you were in my shoes?**",

This week I was asked if I wanted to stay in my current division for the fall because the new division I applied for did not have openings. I was kind of rushed to answer, so I agreed. My question is if I find something at some point in the fall, early or later on, will I be burning bridges by ending this internship? I was told that I could apply for the other division in the spring…so is a bad idea to leave and try and come back?I don’t think anyone in particular will have strong feelings since it’s a government agency. But I do feel bad that someone could have gotten my spot if I had left earlier. I feel like it’s a common understanding that interns take any opportunities they can, so would it be that bad?Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!",

        "content": "This is pertaining to CS with a focus in Machine Learning/AI. After a technical undergrad degree, I've worked for 10+ years, and am looking to upskill and re-focus towards ML/AI, to help with a future career pivot. My understanding is that for undergrad, and probably any non-research Master's degree, the (at least perceived) school quality/ranking is very important. What about for a PhD though? Or a research-based Master's degree? My brief understanding is that here things get blurry because it's more about finding a specific research supervisor and field of research, rather than just trying to get into the highest ranking school you can. Of course we need a criterion, so I'd say something like 'future career prospect maximization'. My concern is that as a mature student with a likely weaker applicant profile, I would probably get into a lower ranking school than my undergrad school. So would that end up looking weak on my resume? What should I consider here? Happy to try and answer any clarifying questions, and hopefully this topic will be useful for others as well. Cheers!",

She'll get a drive from the security office and then I use that drive after she's done. In June, it took her a week because the file sizes of the patches were bigger and whatever internet connection she was using was quite slow. I took the drive from her the week after. I was a whole week late to finish up my part of the patches on the 2 networks I do it on. Not to mention, a few updates from these patches can be moved very easily without the drive and I usually move those first anyway and for some reason, I waited till I got the drive to do those too! I assumed the security office only had 1 drive but I JUST went and asked them and they have 3 apparently! I should have done this before.My boss wasn't very happy and there is a meeting with a few members on the team in 1-2 weeks to discuss patching. I feel like this will reflect really poorly on me. My boss also asked that I create an email chain so we all keep track of patching progress in July, so I've been working extra fast to get them all done this month! I hope they don't ask me what I was doing during that one week delay in June because that was 2 weeks ago and I have no idea why I wasn't more proactive. How badly do you think this can affect me?",

I have had a lot of fun, learned a lot, and generally had a positive experience. I enjoy the people I work with and don't mind coming into work on a Monday morning. I realize that these feelings are invaluable, and I am lucky to be in a position like this.That said, I want more. I don't want to look back in a couple of years and regret not having tried something new. I recently got married, and now that I don't have kids, it is the best time to make a change.I'm specifically asking this question to those of you who were in a similar position. A position where you enjoyed your current role, but it was no longer satisfying you. A position where you felt that you had more to do and a lot more to learn.I'm currently studying extensively to prepare myself for interviews and secure a remote role in the coming months. For those of you who transitioned and left an otherwise comfortable job, how do you feel now? Was it worth it? Are you growing a lot more?I recently heard a quote that went something like, \"regret comes from not having tried something, not failing at the thing you did try.\"",

I got an offer for 150k with a promotion but the company that made the offer has numerous mentions of frequent layoffs on their Glassdoor, and the team I would be joining is largely outsourced (20 out of 25 overseas) & I would not have a clearance after around 1 year. All my friends tell me I'm nuts for saying no to this offer, but on the other hand I like my team my WLB is generally very good, I really like and respect my team lead/po but am lukewarm to the tech stacks & products at both places (legacy C++ and java, and legacy C where I'd be going). I also think my company isn't in a great direction but I think it is more stable than where I'd be headed.Every offer I get I'm paranoid about leaving and being laid off, but I also worry about staying where I'm at and getting hit in a layoff. Would it be irresponsible to stay if I think something might happen & just wait and see? I've survived a few rounds here. I am also super burnt out these days and not in the best mental health after a major injury last year & multiple surgeries so idk which direction I want to go. My heart wants a break and I live with my parents so I'm debating just staying and letting faith decide what happens to me and dealing with the outcome if it happens? Or do I take action now and leave even if its uncomfortable now?",
