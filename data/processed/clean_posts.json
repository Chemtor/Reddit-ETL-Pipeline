Data engineers determining what the stakeholders truly need. * The context of \"what data could we possibly consume\" is a vast space that would require such a large context window that it's unfeasible * Deeply understanding the business * Retrieval augmented generation is getting better at understanding the business but connecting all the dots of where the most value can be generated still feels very far away * Logical / Physical data modeling * Connecting the conceptual with the business need allows for data engineers to anticipate the query patterns that data analysts might want to run.

Most confusing shit ever.I'm more than willing to accept it's an skill issue. But I feel like documentation is pretty much useless. It doesn't help that every single tool decides to make up its own language and concepts to describe things. It doesn't help that the documentation isn't opinionated, straightforward, easy to follow, not all over the place, doesn't show clear examples, how to set it up, what's the proper project structure, what to do if you have a previous project, etc.Again, I concede this may be a skill issue. But this is why so many are put off by the overwhelming amount of tools. They should be simple to use IMO but it seems its quite the opposite.With that said, if anyone has a good, updated, proper guide, preferrably from someone not trying to sell me something, on how to set up and use either of them, I would appreciate it a lot.",

The ironic part is that I basically function as a manager already - I don’t write code anymore, just review PRs occasionally and give architectural recommendations (though teams aren’t obligated to follow them if their actual manager disagrees).I know this sounds crazy, but I could probably sit in this role for another 10 years without anyone noticing or caring. It’s that kind of position where I’m not really adding much value, but I’m also not bothering anyone.After 4 months of grinding leetcode and modern system design to get my technical skills back up to candidate standards, I now have some options to consider.Scenario A (Current Job):- TC: ~$260K- Company: A non-tech company with an older tech stack and lower growth potential (Salesforce, Databricks, Mulesoft)- Role: Overseeing mostly outsourced engineering work- Perks: On-site child care, on-site gym, and a shorter commute- Drawbacks: Less exciting technical work, limited upward mobility in the near term, and no title bump (remains an individual contributor)Scenario B:- TC: ~$210K base not including the fun money equity. - Company: A tech startup with a modern tech stack and real technical challenges (Kafka, Dbt, Snowflake, Flink, Docker, Kubernetes) - Role: Title bump to manager, includes people management responsibilities and a pathway to future leadership roles- Perks: Startup equity and more stimulating work- Drawbacks: Longer commute, no on-site child care or gym, and significantly lower cash compensationWould love to hear what you’d pick and why.",

After taking some notes from my last project, the workflow with AI felt much smoother, and I felt more in control over my prompts and my expectations of what it can provide me.2. This project was much simpler (tech wise). Much less tools, most of the project is only in python, which makes it easier for the AI to follow on the existing setup and provide better solutions and fixes.3. Some tasks just feels frustrating with AI even when you expect it to be very simple. (for example, no matter what I did, it couldn't make a list of my CSV column names, it just couldn't manage it, very weird.)4. When not using UI tools (like in AWS console for example), the workflow feels more right. you are much less likely to get hallucinations (which happened A LOT on AWS console)5. For the data visualization enthusiasts amongst us, I believe making graph settings for matplotlib and alike using AI is the biggest game changer I felt since coding with it. it saves SO MUCH time remembering what settings exists for each graph and plot type, and how to set them correctly.Github repo: [https://github.com/roey132/streamlit\\_dashboard\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/streamlit_dashboard_demo)Streamlit demo link: [https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/](https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/) I believe this project was a lot easier to vibe code because its much smaller and less complex than the daily batch pipeline. that said, it does help me understand more about the potential and risks of vibe coding, and let's me understand better when to trust AI (in its current form) and when to doubt it's responses.to summarize: when working on a project that doesn't have a lot of different environments and tools (this time, 90% python), the value of vibe coding is much higher. also, learning to make your prompts better and more informative can improve the final product a lot, but, still, the AI takes a lot of assumptions when providing answers, and you can't always provide it with 100% of the information and edge cases, which makes it provide very wrong solutions. Understanding what the process should look like and knowing what to expect of your final product is key to make a useful and steady app.I will continue to share my process on my next project in hope it can help anyone! (Also, if you have any cool idea to try for my next project, please let me know! i'm open for ideas)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm currently working with a medallion architecture inside Fabric and would love to hear how others handle the **raw → bronze** process, especially when mixing **incremental and full loads**.Here’s a short overview of our layers:* **Raw**: Raw data from different source systems* **Bronze (technical layer)**: Raw data enriched with technical fields like `business_ts`, `primary_hash`, `payload_hash`, etc.* **Silver**: Structured and modeled data, aggregated based on our business model* **Gold**: Smaller, consumer-oriented aggregates for dashboards, specific departments, etc.In the **raw → bronze** step, a colleague taught me to create two hashes:* `primary_hash`: to uniquely identify a record (based on business keys)* `payload_hash`: to detect if a record has changedWe’re using Delta Tables in the bronze layer and the logic is:* **Insert** if the `primary_hash` does not exist* **Update** if the `primary_hash` exists but the `payload_hash` has changed* **Delete** if a `primary_hash` from a previous load is missing in the current extractionThis logic works well *if* we always had a full load.But here's the issue: our source systems deliver **a mix of full and incremental loads**, and in incremental mode, we might only get a tiny fraction of all records. With the current implementation, that results in **95% of the data being deleted**, even though it's still valid – it just wasn't part of the incremental pull.Now I'm wondering: One idea I had was to **add a boolean flag** (e.g. `is_current`) to mark if the record was seen in the latest load, along with a `last_loaded_ts` field. But then the question becomes: **How can I determine if a record is still “active” when I only get partial (incremental) data and no full snapshot to compare against?**Another aspect I’m unsure about is **data retention and storage costs**. The idea was to **keep the full history of records** permanently, so we could go back and see what the data looked like at a certain point in time (e.g., *\"What was the state on 2025-01-01?\"*). But I’m concerned this could lead to **massive storage costs over time**, especially with large datasets.How do you handle this in practice?* Do you keep historical records in Bronze or move history handling to Silver/Gold?* Do you archive older data somewhere else?* How do you balance auditability and cost?Thanks in advance for any input! I'd really appreciate hearing how others are approaching this kind of problem or i'm the only Person.Thanks a lot!",

        "content": "Hey guys. I recently completed an ETL project that I've been longing to complete and I finally have something presentable. It's an ETL pipeline and dashboard to pull, process and push the data into my dimensionally modeled Postgres database and I've used Streamlit to visualize the data. The steps: 1. Data Extraction: I used the Fotmob API to extract all the match ids and details in the English Premier League in nested json format using the ip-rotator library to bypass any API rate limits.2. Data Storage: I dumped all the json files from the API into a GCP bucket. (around 5k json files)3. Data Processing: I used DataProc to run the spark jobs (used 2 spark workers) of reading the data and inserting the data into the staging tables in postgres. (all staging tables are truncate and load)4. Data Modeling: This was the most fun part about the project as I understood each aspect of the data, what I have, what I do not and at what level of granularity I need to have to avoid duplicates in the future. Have dim tables (match, player, league, date) and fact tables (3 of them for different metric data for match and player, but contemplating if I need a lineup fact). Used generate\\_series for the date dimension. Added insert, update date columns and also added sequences to the targer dim/fact tables.5. Data Loading: After dumping all the data into the stg tables, I used a merge query to insert/update if the key id exists or not. I created SQL views on top of these tables to extract the relevant information I need for my visualizations. The database is Supabase PostgreSQL.6. Data Visualization: I used Streamlit to showcase the matplotlib, plotly and mplsoccer (soccer-specific visualization) plots. There are many more visualizations I can create using the data I have.I used Airflow for orchestrating the ETL pipelines (from extracting data, creating tables, sequences if they don't exist, submitting pyspark scripts to the gcp bucket to run on dataproc, and merging the data to the final tables), Terraform to manage the GCP services (terraform apply and destroy, plan and fmt are cool) and Docker for containerization. The Streamlit dashboard is [live here](https://pldashboard.streamlit.app/) and [Github ](https://github.com/karthikgarimella37/EPL_Fotmob)as well. I am open to any feedback, advice and tips on what I can improve in the pipeline and visualizations. My future work is to include more visualizations, add all the leagues available in the API and learn and use dbt for testing and sql work. Currently, I'm looking for any entry-level data engineering/data analytics roles as I'm a recent MS data science graduate and have 2 years of data engineering experience. If there's more I can do to showcase my abilities, I would love to learn and implement them. If you have any advice on how to navigate such a market, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you've reached this point. I appreciate it. https://preview.redd.it/b4mq029q72ef1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf3e8129c1a144e78b1decf32642278afc1e24fhttps://preview.redd.it/8m13gy8q72ef1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=526ebcad5616d0bfcb1c6e4a8357cd6833c06d97https://preview.redd.it/lj70pv8q72ef1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b2094bb13d30c8a6b33798905f128b5c88f162https://preview.redd.it/617odx8q72ef1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef3bb7184eb9d012de8c9979df5c0da15be80b8https://preview.redd.it/c42efw8q72ef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6660c876a1487b5c7a313afbd28b90776a7dd64https://preview.redd.it/5ynyb59q72ef1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0433856dacc83622fd06f4aa6be764e688d554ahttps://preview.redd.it/nvu3lw8q72ef1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=646dec3a6e11b8c268fc91a196eb8ad0d149ef59https://preview.redd.it/m7v98w8q72ef1.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=16180537c5ef391bea1f73619b68c75c4763f0c7",

Use 3 layers of spelling corrections using words from a bag of clean words with: word2vec, 2 layers of Levenshtein distance2. Create a master table of all degrees out there over 600 degrees3. Tokenize the free text input column, the degrees column from master table, crossjoin them and creacte a match score with the amount of matching words from the text column against the master data column4. To this point for each row it will have many cnadidates, so we're picking the degree name in which has the highest amount of matching words against the text column5. The output of this method tested with a portion of 500k records, and with 600 degrees in master table, we got over 75% matching score which means we found the equivalent degree name for 75% of the text records, it can be improved by adding more degree names, modify confidence %, and train the model with more dataThis method combines 2 ML models, and finds the best matching degree name against each lineThe output would be like this: id, degree 1, technician in public relations, degree in public relations 2, bachelor in business management, bachelors degree in business management 3, high school diploma, high school degree 4, php, degree in software development 5, dgree in finance, degree in finance 6, masters in cs, masters degree in computer science 7, mstr in logisticss, masters degree in logisticsI made it as a Python library based on PySpark which doesn't require any comercial LLM AI APIs ... fully open source, so that anyone that struggles with the same issue can use the library directly to save time and headachesYou can find the library on PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/](https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/)Or install it directly`pip install pynlpclassifier`I made an [article ](https://medium.com/@hamzahbdeveloper/introducing-pynlpclassifier-correct-the-spelling-and-categorize-large-free-text-input-data-using-da1a93408f30)explainning in depth the library, the functions, and an example of use caseI hope you found my research work helpfull and that can be useful to share with the community.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I have been hired at a startup where I claimed that I can revamp the whole architecture. The current architecture is that we replicate the production Postgres DB to another RDS instance which is considered our data warehouse. - I create views in Postgres - use Logstash to send that data from DW to Kibana- make basic visuals in KibanaWe also use Tray.io for bringing in Data from sources like Surveymonkey and Mixpanel (platform that captures user behavior)Now the thing is i haven't really worked on the mainstream tools like snowflake, redshift and haven't worked on any orchestration tool like airflow as well. The main business objectives are to track revenue, platform engagement, jobs in a dashboard. I have recently explored Tableau and the team likes it as well. 1. I want to ask how should I design the architecture?2. What tools do I use for data warehouse. 3. What tools do I use for visualization4. What tool do I use for orchestration5. How do I talk to data using natural language and what tool do I use for that Is there a guide I can follow. The main point of concerns for this revamp are cost & utilizing AI. The management wants to talk to data using natural language. P.S: I would love to connect with Data Engineers who created a data warehouse from scratch to discuss this further Edit: I think I have given off a very wrong vibe from this post. I have previously worked as a DE but I haven't used these popular tools. I know DE concepts. I want to make a medallion architecture. I am well versed with DE practices and standards, I just don't want to implement something that is costly and not beneficial for the company. I think what I was looking for is how to weigh my options between different tools. I already have an idea to use AWS Glue, Redshift and Quicksight",

A lot of times recursive CTEs hide data modeling issues underneath - using the RANK window function Skipping ranks is never needed and causes annoying problems. Use DENSE_RANK or ROW_NUMBER 100% of the time unless you work for data analytics for the Olympics- using INSERT INTO Writing data should be a single idempotent and atomic operation. This means you should be using MERGE or INSERT OVERWRITE 100% of the time. Some older databases don’t allow this, in which case you should TRUNCATE/DELETE first and then INSERT INTO.

        "content": "Snowflake provides very nice UIs for entering metadata on tables, views and columns (with the option of AI text generation). But in order to use these nifty metadata UIs, the Snowflake analysts must use a role that has been transferred OWNERSHIP of the objects. Unfortunately, having OWNERSHIP also allows these analysts to drop, create and alter objects which are inappropriate privileges for most of them. Also, transferring ownership of Snowflake objects to many new roles is complicated and can effectively break views for end users and change our \"future\" role assignments. I wish there was a METADATA privilege that was dedicated to allowing the creation and management of object metadata, but there isn't. Does anyone know of a work-around? We are not ready to purchase or adopt a third party data catalog platform.",

        "content": "I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.1. >Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change \"atomic\" within a single transaction.I understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as \"RUN\", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.What is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations? I do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK. Logically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?2. I am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers. That is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct? databaseChangeLog: - changeSet: id: periods-log-trigger author: XYZ runOnChange: true changes: - sqlFile: path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql - sqlFile: path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql rollback: - sql: sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()3. Back to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.Because createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is dropped?Thanks everyone!",

Its running basic filters over 1B rows in 50ms (single node, no indexing), it’s currently outperforming ClickHouse by 10x on the same machine. I’m curious if this is interesting to people?

        "title": "Inserting audit record with dbt / Snowflake",
        "author": "backend-dev",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "What is a good approach when you want to insert an audit record into a table using dbt & Snowflake? The audit record should be atomic with the actual data that was inserted, but because dbt does not support Snowflake transactions, this seems not possible. My thoughts are to insert the audit record in the post-hook, but if the audit record insert fails for some reason, my audit and actual data will be out of sync.What is the best approach to get around this limitation.I did try to add begin transaction as the first pre-hook and commit as the last post-hook, but although it works, it is hacky and then locks the table if there is a failure due to no rollback being executed.EDIT: Some more infoMy pipeline will run every 4 hours or thereabouts and the target table will grow fairly large (already >1B rows). I am trying strategies for saving on cost (minimising bytes scanned, etc).The source data has an updated_at field and in the dbt model I use: select from source where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) from target). The select max(updated_at) from target is computed from metadata, so is quite efficient (0 bytes scanned).I want to gather stats and audit info (financial data) for each of my runs. E.g. min(updated_at), max(updated_at), sum(some_value) & rowcount of each incremental load. Each incremental load does have a unique uid, so one could query from the target table after append, but that is likely going to scan a lot of data.To mitigate against having to scan the target table for run stats, my thoughts were to stage the increment using a separate dbt model ('staging'). This staging model will stage the increment as a new table, extract the audit info from the staged increment and write the audit log. Then another model ('append') will append the staged increment to the target table. There are a few issues with this as well, including re-staging a new increment before the previous increment was appended. But I have ways around that, but it relies on the fact that audit records for both the staging runs and append runs are correctly and reliably inserted. Hence the question.",

        "title": "Architecture Dilemma: DLT vs. Custom Framework for 300+ Real-Time Tables on Databricks",
        "author": "warleyco96",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'd love to get your opinion and feedback on a large-scale architecture challenge.**Scenario:** I'm designing a near-real-time data platform for over 300 tables, with the constraint of using **only the native Databricks ecosystem** (no external tools).**The Core Dilemma:** I'm trying to decide between using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and building a **Custom Framework**.My initial evaluation of DLT suggests it might struggle with some of our critical data manipulation requirements, such as:1. **More Options of Data Updating on Silver and Gold tables:** 1. **Full Loads:** I haven't found a native way to do a Full/Overwrite load in Silver. I can only add a TRUNCATE as an operation at position 0, simulating a CDC. In some scenarios, it's necessary for the load to always be full/overwrite. 2. **Partial/Block Merges:** The ability to perform complex partial updates, like deleting a block of records based on a business key and then inserting the new block (no primary-key at row level).2. **Merge for specific columns:** The environment tables have metadata columns used for lineage and auditing. Columns such as first\\_load\\_author and update\\_author, first\\_load\\_author\\_external\\_id and update\\_author\\_external\\_id, first\\_load\\_transient\\_file, update\\_load\\_transient\\_file, first\\_load\\_timestamp, and update\\_timestamp. For incremental tables, for existing records, only the update columns should be updated. The first\\_load columns should not be changed.My perception is that DLT doesn't easily offer this level of granular control. Am I mistaken here? I'm new to this resource. I couldn't find any real-world examples for product scenarios, just some basic educational examples.On the other hand, I considered a model with one continuous stream per table but quickly ran into the \\~145 execution context limit per cluster, making that approach unfeasible.**Current Proposal:** My current proposed solution is the reactive architecture shown in the image below: a central \"router\" detects new files and, via the Databricks Jobs API, triggers small, ephemeral jobs (using `AvailableNow`) for each data object.**My Question for the Community:** What are your thoughts on this event-driven pattern? Is it a robust and scalable solution for this scenario, or is there a simpler or more efficient approach within the Databricks ecosystem that I might be overlooking?https://preview.redd.it/znq1swylp3ef1.png?width=5661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7a4d4ac35f7803c4aa1576a7f70d5cc641429aThe architecture above illustrates the Oracle source with AWS DMS. This scenario is simple because it's CDC. However, there's user input in files, SharePoint, Google Docs, TXT files, file shares, legacy system exports, and third-party system exports. These are the most complex writing scenarios that I couldn't solve with DLT, as mentioned at the beginning, because they aren't CDC, some don't have a key, and some have partial merges (delete + insert).Thanks in advance for any insights or experiences you can share!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm working on a project where I'm building a chatbot that can answer questions from scanned infrastructure project documents (think government-issued construction certificates, with financial tables, scope of work, and quantities executed). I have around 100 PDFs, each corresponding to a different project.I want to build a chatbot which lets users ask questions like:* “Where have we built toll plazas?”* “Have we built a service road spanning X m?”* “How much earthwork was done in 2023?”These documents are scanned PDFs with non-standard table formats, which makes this harder than a typical document QA setup.# Current Pipeline (working for one doc):1. **OCR**: I’m using Amazon Textract to extract raw text (structured as best as possible from scanned PDFs). I’ve tried Google Vision also but Textract gave the most accurate results for multi-column layouts and tables.2. **Parsing**: Since table formats vary a lot across documents (headers might differ, row counts vary, etc.), regex didn’t scale well. Instead, I’m using ChatGPT (GPT-4) with a prompt to parse the raw OCR text into a structured JSON format (split into sections like salient\\_feature, scope of work, financial burification table, quantities executed table, etc.)3. **QA**: Once I have the structured JSON, I pass it back into ChatGPT and ask questions like:The chatbot processes the JSON and returns accurate answers.“Where did I construct a toll plaza?” “What quantities were executed for Bituminous Concrete in 2023?”# Challenges I'm facing:1. **Scaling to multiple documents**: What’s the best architecture to support 100+ documents? * Should I store all PDFs in S3 (or similar) and use a trigger (like S3 event or Lambda) to run Textract + JSON pipeline as soon as a new PDF is uploaded? * Should I store all final JSONs in a directory and load them as knowledge for the chatbot (e.g., via LangChain + vector DB)? * What’s a clean, production-grade pipeline for this?2. **Inconsistent table structures** Even though all documents describe similar information (project cost, execution status, quantities), the tables vary significantly in headers, table length, column allignment, multi-line rows, blank rows etc. Textract does an okay job, but still makes mistakes — and ChatGPT sometimes hallucinates or misses values when prompted to structure it into JSON. Is there a better way to handle this step?3. **JSON parsing via LLM: how to improve reliability?** Right now I give ChatGPT a single prompt like: “Convert this raw OCR text into a JSON object with specific fields: \\[project\\_name, financial\\_bifurcation\\_table, etc.\\]”. But this isn't 100% reliable when formats vary across documents. Sometimes certain sections get skipped or misclassified. * Should I chain multiple calls (e.g., one per section)? * Should I fine-tune a model or use function calling instead?# Looking for advice on:* Has anyone built something similar for scanned docs with LLMs?* Any recommended open-source tools or pipelines for structured table extraction from OCR text?* How would you architect a robust pipeline that can take in a new scanned document → extract structured JSON → allow semantic querying over all projects?Thanks in advance — this is my first real-world AI project and I would really really appreciate any advice yall have as I am quite stuck lol :)",

They use SSIS - with some additional third-party connectors - to ingest the data to SQL Server in an ETL approach. The primary customer are BI analysts using a phenomenally busy on-premise Tableau Server.From what I have seen it's functioning well and people have made good use of the data. For a public sector organisation I am impressed by what they've achieved!The limitations are no distinction between dev and prod, no CI/CD setup or version control, no clarity on dependencies, no lineage visibility outside of the handful of developers, and data models that only exist within Tableau.Their budget for new licensing is the square root of zero. They have explored cloud (Azure) but their data sources are so broad and their usage is so high that the costs would be beyond their budget. They started looking at dbt Core but have cold feet due to the growing divide between Core and Cloud.I have read some very good things about SQL Mesh and I think it would tackle a lot of their current limitations. My thinking is to retain SSIS but as EL and implement SQL Mesh as the T.Has anyone tackled anything similar before or have any thoughts beyond my limited thinking? The team seem up for the challenge but I don't want to lead them in the wrong direction as it's a big overhaul!",

        "author": "sumant28",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This seems like it should be a really basic pattern but I have been struggling to figure out what is ideal rather than just what will work. To my surprise I do not really see an existing solution that entirely answers this post but from ChatGPT I have a strong hunch what I need to do but I have further issues to clarify.If there is a daily ingest of about 1MB of data in JSON is it best to partition that data in the raw or bronze folder from the date as a string or instead to partition by year, month and day. All this time I was doing the latter approach thinking that was optimal but I have since found out that only is best for huge data systems which often further partition into hours and minutes and deal with petabytes or terabytes of data.The issue I have learned is that partition trees grow too large with calendar partitions rather than the simple flat structure of date strings. However my issue is that in terms of queries I have nothing ad hoc. The only thing the data is used for is to create dashboards filtering at different levels of time granularity. For example some dashboards would be by week, some by fortnight, some by month, some by year.For these queries that power these dashboards I do not know if the earlier partition even allows any benefits of partitions at all. I read that the partition still helps but I was not able to understand why. My most important dashboard is by week and I do not see how a partition by date string allows the query engine to speed up filtering by the current week or the previous week.I have some other questions specific to AWS. For the etl job that transforms the bronze layer to parquet I learned that bookmarks also need to be used. I read that it is best practice to have as a source the crawled data catalog table rather than the JSON files. Is this still true? That means for job bookmarking in order to process only incremental data you have to rely on a key which is a column of data or field rather than the easier to understand bookmarking by file. If you are bookmarking by key that points to using date string rather than using a trio of date partitions like year, month and day which are all also nested. For reducing complexity is that the right assumption?",

        "author": "planesforstars",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Last year, I found myself in a familiar cycle: I'd watch a tutorial, follow along perfectly, feel like a programming genius... then completely freeze when faced with a blank editor and a real problem to solve. I knew the syntax. I could explain concepts. But I couldn't *build* anything meaningful without a step-by-step guide.Sound familiar? I've come to call this the competent imposter phase - where you understand enough to recognize good code, but not enough to produce it independently.# The Gap No One Talks AboutI've noticed a pattern in programming education that no one seems to address directly: there's a massive cognitive leap between understanding code and generating it. It's like knowing all the rules of chess but having no strategic intuition. You know how the pieces move, but you can't see the patterns that make a good player.After months of frustration, I decided to approach this problem systematically. Here's what I discovered works:# 1. Reverse Engineering > TutorialsInstead of watching more tutorials, I started downloading open-source projects that were *just* beyond my skill level. Not massive frameworks, but small utilities with 300-1000 lines of code.The process: Run the program to understand what it does Read through the code without judgment Delete small sections and try to reimplement them Gradually expand what I deleted until I could recreate substantial portionsThis forced me to think like the original developer rather than just consuming their finished work.# 2. The Tiny Feature TechniqueOne of my breakthroughs came when I stopped trying to build complete applications. Instead, I focused on adding tiny features to existing code:* Take a simple calculator app and add a history feature Add dark mode to a static website Implement a simple search function in a list appThis approach gave me the scaffolding to work within while still requiring creative problem-solving.# 3. Deliberate Debugging PracticeI started intentionally breaking working code, then fixing it. This might sound counterproductive, but it taught me to read error messages properly and understand how the pieces fit together.I'd introduce a bug, wait 24 hours (so I'd forget exactly what I changed), then come back and fix it. This simulated the real-world experience of debugging unfamiliar code.# 4. The Explain It To A Beginner TestAfter implementing something, I forced myself to write an explanation as if teaching it to someone who just started coding. This revealed gaps in my understanding that weren't apparent when I was just following along with tutorials.If I couldn't explain a concept clearly, I knew I needed to revisit it.# 5. Embracing Uncomfortable ToolsI noticed I was avoiding certain technologies because they felt intimidating. For me, this was working with APIs and asynchronous code.So I created a rule: at least once a week, I'd work on something that made me uncomfortable. Not to master it immediately, but to reduce the anxiety around it.# The Mental Shift That Changed EverythingThe biggest change came when I stopped thinking of programming as knowing things and started seeing it as figuring things out.Experienced developers aren't successful because they've memorized everything - they're successful because they've developed robust mental models for approaching new problems. They know how to break down complex tasks, research effectively, and test their assumptions.# My Practical Advice1. **Create a Learning Project** \\- A single, evolving project you keep enhancing as you learn new concepts. Mine was a personal book tracking app that grew from a command-line tool to a web app over 6 months.2. **Code Review Yourself** \\- After completing something, wait a week, then review your own code as if it was written by someone else. Be critical but constructive.",

Or does something like Kotlin actually have C as the underlying language, so Kotlin manipulates C++ which manipulates the bits? Or like with Swift, is it manipulating objective-C or C under the hood, which then manipulates the bits?Or do all languages directly affect bits? Are there restrictions based on platform or whatever?Would love to read an explanation or be linked to a video that explains things. Thanks!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm a relatively new teacher at a high school (15-17 y/o's), and I teach programming. The subject only has one 40-minute class a week per group, **with no option for giving them homework or anything outside of class hours**.I first learned programming with Unity and C#, and that's what I want to try with them. I think static typing and having an interface is a good way to teach programming, and game dev simply sounds more fun. I tried it already for a few months last year, it didn't really work out, it was too confusing for them. But I still want to give it a shot. (Especially now that I'm actually going to have a fucking projector so they can see my screen). (Hopefully). (Yes this is not a very high-budget school).The idea is to teach them the very basics C# (variables, conditionals, functions, maybe arrays and loops), and have them play with the basic Unity components (sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, and basic GUI). No OOP (except to interact with components). No 3D. No fuss. But even that sounds like too much for our restrictions, with my limited experience.So, how would you approach giving a class like that? I don't know if this is the right place, but I really don't know where else to post this.I'm not married to the idea of Unity or gamedev though, I'm open to suggestions. But it has to be something interactive and graphical so they're interested. Bear in mind these are high-schoolers, most of them aren't interested in programming, and the class is only there to kind of teach them how computers work and how to think systematically.Some other things I've thought of:* Tkinter: don't love the idea of dynamically-typed Python, and not that engaging* Godot: interface more confusing than Unity's imo* Pygame: even if it's simpler, no GUI at all is arguably way harder* Arduino: really cool idea and easier programming, but obviously we'd need Arduinos, which we don't have, and emulators like TinkerCAD just aren't the same* Java forms on NetBeans: not that engagingI'd love to hear any insight or suggestions whatsoever, especially if any of you have been teachers.",

I went through psychological therapy and recently surgery so I cant physically move excessively at the moment.Please dont delete this I just want to ask for an advice. I dont have any Exp in computer science.I play games as a hobby.I just need something as a leisure like me learning Japanese at the moment.Thank u \\.( ^_^ )./ Edit : Hey guys Just wanting to update you. First off, Thanks for all of the help you guys provided. I'm still reading a lot of them and very sorry if I can't reply on all of it.Second, I decided to stick to C# and check the waters again and probably give it a week and if not I'm switching to Python and if that still sucks like someone commented just stick with C.Now the IDE, I can't use VStudio cause I'm using Mint. I used jetbrains before but my oh my that IDE is so laggy in my Computer ( I told you computer is ass! ). A lot of people commented on Vim & Neovim. Now, I know those two are good and maybe you can also include LazyVim but I am just a beginner. I don't even know how to use a library let alone customising Vim to make it in a IDE. So Im at VS code at the moment.A lot of you guys are too good for me xD.Vim is nice cause you don't really need to use a mouse whenever you code. It will be a lot faster just using the keyboard but it has steep learning curve y' know just like playing Dark souls. It takes a while and I just want to learn a language before I can jump to Vim.I know this edit is a long ass speech of drama but I really appreciate the help!",

        "content": "If you're a complete beginner who's just started programming or are about to begin your journey, please go through this first (This really helped me put things into perspective):What is programming?- I know you kinda know what it is but I bet most don't. We all know the bookish definition. But have you actually ever thought about it a bit deeper?A computer is a really dumb machine when it comes to doing things human can do and understand. If you say to a human - Go fetch me that pen :pen: that's over there on the table! They will gladly go and bring it to you. But to a computer (machine) you'd need to break that instruction into steps. Steps that may look like the following:Step 1: Hey computer! Get up, if you're sitting.Step 2: Now locate the table.Step 3: Identify something that looks like a pen :pen: Step 4: Head over to the tableStep 5: Pick up the penStep 6: Locate the personStep 7: Head over to the person with the penStep 8: Give the pen to the personStep 9: Wait for further instructions.Step 10: If no instructions given go back to where you were earlier. I may have missed a few steps here but you get the idea. Right?To a computer you would need to tell it the exact steps it would have to perform to complete the task.And that right there is programming. The instruction I have written use English language which a computer doesn't understand so humans built programming languages like C, Python etc.So every time you sit down to write a program just remember that you're telling a computer what it needs to do to complete a task. That's it. Hence, learning programming is more about developing your ability to break a problem into steps & convert those steps into code. Note: I know this is super basic stuff but strangely none of my teachers back in college explained it to me this way. And knowing this now makes things a bit easier.",

        "content": "I have been using Codefinity for a few weeks and wanted to share my honest review. Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.That said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.Just to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.I’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time. Did you find that the content goes beyond beginner level and really builds useful skills? Do you think it’s worth continuing with, or are there better platforms out there for someone looking to grow step by step? I would appreciate hearing your experiences. Thanks!",

        "author": "Puzzleheaded-Mix5149",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello all, I hope this is ok to post here. I am a complete beginner to programming and my second language is Cree. I am posting here to ask how I should tackle this large project I have envisioned. My goal is to create a desktop-based application that is a dictionary for my Indigenous language. However I would like this to be more than just a dictionary, for example I would like to include all the conjugation tables for all verbs, which we have quite a lot in Cree. (In fact, around 85% of “words” in Cree are verbs). This would literally require tens of thousands of entries.Now every word can have quite a number of connections to other concepts. For example I envision this dictionary to include a section for synonyms and antonyms for each entry, each entry having a section for “semantic field” for related entries, a section for each entry showing all other entries from the root of that word. As well as relationships between words that mean the same, for example the same verb, just simply having a different gender for the object.I will just give some examples below:ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓐ (aahkwaatin) means “it is fierce, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓰᐤ (aahkwaatisiiu) means “s/he is fierce, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᔅᑲᑎᓐ (aahkwaaskatin) means “it is frozen very solid”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᔕᒻ (aahkwaatisham) means “s/he cuts it badly, seriously”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑲᒥᑌᐤ (aahkwaakamiteu) means “it is painfully hot liquid”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑌᔨᒣᐤ (aahkwaateyimeu) means “s/he thinks s/he is harmful, dangerous”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᓯᓈᑯᓐ (aahkwaasinaakun) means “it looks dangerous, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑖᐦᑲᓴᒻ (aahkwaataahkasam) means “s/he burns it badly”You can see the pattern. Certain parts of the word mean certain things and this can be applied to all other words, this complex connectedness is what I would like to show and be able to interact with in my dictionary. To be able to categorize, display and filter through such related roots and terms.My question is which programming language should I learn to attempt such a project? As well as any tips or references that you all may have on how I should approach such a complex project.Thank you very much for taking the time to read through this and helping me keep my language alive and flourishing.Also, if this language interests you, feel free to PM me to learn more about it! I am clearly passionate about my language and willing to share my knowledge with others.",

        "content": "**NOTE:** I made that post in r/Unicode as well, but as that community is both small and not programming related, I'm posting here to have more chances to get an answer.I am trying to implement code for Unicode and, I was just checking the [available codes](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/) and while everything was going well, when I reached to the 4-byte codes, things started pissing me off. So, I would expect that the latest codes will not be defined, as Unicode has not yet used all the available numbers for the 4-byte range. So for now, I'll just check the latest available one and update my code in new Unicode versions.Now, here is the bizarre thing... For some reason, there are undefined codes BETWEEN sets! For some reason, the people who design and implement Unicode decided to leave some codes empty and then, continue normally! For example, the codes between [adlam](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#adlam) and [indic-siyaq-numbers](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#indic-siyaq-numbers) are not defined. What's even more crazy is that in some sets themselves, there are undefined codes. One example is the set [ethiopic-extended-b](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#ethiopic-extended-b) which has about 3 codes not defined.Because of that, what would be just a simple \"start/end\" range check, it will now have to be done with an array that has different ranges. That means more work for me to implement and worse performance to the programs that will use that code.With all that in mind, unless there is a reason that they implemented it that way and someone knows and can tell me, I will have my code consider the undefined codes as valid and just be done with it and everyone that has a problem can just complain to the Unicode organization to fix their mess...",

However, I am struggling to find roles that I feel I would be suited for. I know that what I like is more low-level stuff (specifically C++), and that I don't really have any interest in web development or working in the traditional \"big tech\" companies, which I feel like are the dominant hiring fields for new grads. I think embedded systems would be a good fit for me, or possibly programming for telecom (though maybe that's also just embedded systems?). I will have a few decently-sized resume projects under my belt by graduation, and one will hopefully be done by the end of the summer for earlier application deadlines. I'm also interested in AI, but more of the mathematical/backend stuff (i.e. being one of the people working on PyTorch itself or developing new models, not just using PyTorch to create a CNN or something).So, my questions: What kind of things should I be looking for as I search for job postings online? When I'm looking for alumni from my school to connect with, what kind of roles should I be looking for them to have? What skills should I be developing over the next year to get a position like the one I want? (Also, any other general advice from people who have been on a similar path is appreciated).",

Someone could easily get all my knowledge and experience in development within 6 months of casual 5 hours a week of learning. I always did the bare minimum(for my standards), but not even a minute beyond that. Never got remotely curious for anything extra than the task that was handed to me.

I’m a junior dev currently learning backend web development and building my own authentication system for a project.Here’s some context:* I’m building a **signup/login flow** using Supabase.* I use Supabase's **Auth Management HTTP API**, not their frontend SDK.* The flow is: 1. The **client** sends an HTTP request to **my server** with credentials. 2. My server does validation/processing. 3. Then it makes an HTTP request to Supabase (signup/login endpoint). 4. If Supabase returns a JWT, the **server should send it back to the client**.This is the high level design of how things would work, removing the additional steps and etc..Now here’s where I’m stuck:>I thought I would need correlation IDs or session tracking or something, but now I’m learning maybe the HTTP protocol handles that automatically — but I’m not 100% sure how.Can someone explain this? Does each HTTP request automatically maintain its response pipe or connection, even if there are multiple users? Do I need to manually track which request came from who? Thank you in advance",

Specifically, I'm trying to figure out the best way to:* **Handle code snippets:** How do you make them easily readable, searchable, and runnable (if applicable) within your notes?* **Integrate diagrams:** What tools or methods do you use to quickly create and embed visual representations of data structures or system architectures?* **Create a quick reference system:** How do you organize your notes so you can quickly find key concepts or syntax when you're working on a project?I've considered things like Notion, OneNote, and even just Markdown files in a Git repo or some ipad apps with pencil to get handwritten feel and touch (avoiding physical book for reason like damage, lost or scribble by childern). What's worked best for you, and why? Any underrated apps or workflows I should consider?Appreciate any tips!",

They offered me a good environment to learn and grow, the people working there were very nice and patient.The thing is that the company uses their own internal framework for backend, it's fast, the clients are satisfied with it , I found it easy to use (it also helped me develop the skill of decoding and understanding others' code, learning more about software architectures, proposing some changes...) but I'm worried that because I'm not using more common technologies like React, Django, Spring, etc., I might be hurting my chances when I apply to other jobs in the future especially if I do my end of studies project at the same company.Do you think that this might a disadvantage when applying for other jobs after graduation ?",

In 2023, I completed CS50 Python and in 2024 finished CS50x, though I could only do one real project for each — both were course finals — since school kept me busy. After graduating, I finally had time and built around 8 projects. For the first few, I had clear ideas but rushed the process, using ChatGPT a lot for code (though I understood the logic). Later, I changed my approach: I'd plan the project, share my thought process with ChatGPT, ask for feedback on my logic, request pseudocode if needed, and then code it step-by-step. If stuck, I'd ask for guidance — not code — especially with library functions. I even added “No code dump, just guide me” to my prompts. It helped me learn a lot, but I’m wondering: **am I on the right path?** Is there a better way to balance learning and coding with AI support? Should I continue this approach?",

I've been looking into programming for a little while, I (think) I've learned most of the basics of python but I'm still very much a beginner at this point and I'm looking into some more specific things I can do with it just to grow my skill and learn more about the language. Also I'm also a big ice hockey fan so I like to implement that where I can. So this is a simple webscrapping program I made, asks the user to input a players name, uses that name to find a url from [hockey-database.com](http://hockey-database.com) for that player, scrapes the stat totals, and prints them out to the user. It's functional, but I keep having this feeling that I've been doing something completely stupid and wrong and that there is a much better way to do this. any advice on how I could make this better would be appreciated, I made this entirely by looking up guides and reading some documentation, so if I did in fact do anything stupid that's my excuse :)",

Mountains of tech debt, no documentation, no one knows what's going on and it's just chaos.Yet the company is making record profits, and we boast about how well we are financially in meetings. There are randos who seemingly have a full time job to send a few emails a week. People coordinating in office fun events that the \"tech team\" can't even attend because they are so heads down. We scramble and burn out while people literally eat cake.Also of course all across the industry we are seeing layoffs in every facet of software (not just devs) while companies rake in profits. I'd imagine they are all running on fumes right?Is this just the norm now, to run on skeleton crews and burn out? Are you seeing this at your company?

I have been applying like crazy and finally got an interview with a company, and I thought that “Finally, I might land this job as I cleared 4 rounds”. But bro, this one totally broke me.Here’s how it went:1. **HR call** – pretty standard.2. **Online assessment** – did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions3. **Home Assignment** – spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).4. **Follow-up Round** – 1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** – I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a \"have a nice day\" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.No idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.I am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::tired_face:Anyway, just needed a place to vent this out.Thanks for reading.

I got lots of accolades, denied for a raise because it just wasn't in the budget even though we had record profits, meets expectations and not exceptional or above average. Just got given an average rating because of the stacked ranking is basically designed so you can never be exceeds expectations....And the worst part is that you will get laid off at any time for literally no reason other than, the shareholders need more money, or the executives need a little bit extra for themselves. So like, what's the point of working hard anymore?**Here's a typical scenario, the one my co-worker experienced last year at Microsoft:**Working at Microsoft, work his ass off every single day of his life, glued to his computer like a literal servant.

These AI agents would not just automate coding, but also perform broader tasks like negotiations and decision-making—mostly for other AI agents.He aims to deploy the **first billion AI agents by the end of 2025**, with **trillions more to follow**, suggesting a sweeping automation of roles traditionally handled by humans. No detailed timeline has been provided.The announcement has implications beyond just software engineering, but it could especially impact how the tech industry views the future of programming careers.",

        "content": "I was an engineering manager at big tech (now in finance). I’ll just throw in my own opinion on hiring. If you’re a talented and hardworking person who loves CS, stay hopeful. At big tech it is well understood that AI is a tool and the true magic comes from person + machine. Remember that software is written for people using a human readable language. It will forever serve humans and will require human operators. AI will never fully replace you.Experienced folks also tend to lose motivation and become bitter over time. New grads will always deliver a wave of fresh energy and competition. With a good blend of naïveté and starry eyed optimism, you’re a hot commodity. Like a vampire, company needs annual new blood to keep innovating. FANG will always have new grad hiring programs. Lastly, this is still a golden age for software. The responsibility for a software engineer would evolve to take on more breadth. CEOs won’t suddenly add “prompting software to do shit” on their schedules. It will still be you bringing that software to life.If you love the field, love the course work, you should still be very excited about the prospects of this career.",

        "author": "AugusteToulmouche",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a backend engineer at a (well funded) startup, helped out with the interview process recently. We wanted to fill these 3 roles: backend, devops, and data engineering. I was surprised at how quickly we were able to wrap it up.Couple of observations:__You're actually pretty cooked if you don't have networking skills.__We received 500+ applications across all the 3 roles in just one week, which seemed crazy for a seed stage startup in a niche industry. Even after filtering them for (a) location (given lots of people from abroad or other cities were yolo applying) (b) relevant experience (have they worked with the same stack before?) and (c) school (least weight but obviously relevant), we had about \\~50 quality candidates, or about \\~15 for each role. Quick 30 min intro + technical verbal call with them filtered down the pool to \\~5 per role. We then did more in-depth technical interviews.Funnily enough, out of the 3 that ended up getting hired, 2 were recommended internally by other coworkers (we have a referral bonus to incentivize them + wanted to hire people who have previously worked with someone on the team who can vouch for their skills) and 1 was hired because they cold DM'd the CEO on twitter (with a surprisingly comprehensive memo on how they'd improve our platform and their relevant experience). So yeah, 500+ applications only to hire people we already kinda knew._If you're getting into CS_: Attend hackathons/conferences, network aggressively during your internships, contribute to popular open-source projects if only to expand your connections, stay in touch with people from your school and former colleagues, hit up your network to reach out if they've a role you'd be a fit for, take initiative and cold DM people. Whatever it takes to build your network and get your foot through the door.__AI slop has fried the brains of a lot of new grads.__Look, I like cursor/claude code as much as anybody else and have no shame in admitting it has boosted my productivity a ton. But interviewing people has made me _very_ glad I graduated before LLMs took off.This is because a lot of candidates were either (a) blatantly cheating during the interview using some sort of AI tool (could tell from their eye movement and/or how they arrived at the correct answer but couldn't justify how they got there at all) OR (b) didn't have the intuition you'd expect from a software engineer who has spent years coding by throwing stuff at the wall and looking things up (\"learning how to learn\").I'm personally starting to think AI is a net negative for new grads in that it both nerfs your reasoning muscles (unless u know how to use it properly, i.e as a resource to speed up your learning process wrt core concepts, instead of a black box u mindlessly copy + paste from) AND also forces employers to put higher weight on credentialism (prestige of your school/internships/full time jobs/networking) given the rampant amount of cheating it enables during a remote technical interview.Wouldn't be surprised if in-person interviews became the norm again, which is unfortunate because that would reduce the amount of economic mobility available to someone w/o much experience who say went to a no name school and lives in the middle of nowhere.Good luck!",

I’m the most recent dev to join the team.At the beginning, I noticed people didn’t offer opinions when the lead dev spoke, and I assumed it was fear. This guy curses during dev meetings when he sees weird stuff (usually some weird requirement from product), so I thought everyone was just intimidated.But as time went on, I realized the lead dev isn’t an ogre, he just lacks social skills. And honestly, I think there’s a lack of trust in the contractors. These guys, they do the bare minimum. Clean code practices is like an alien concept. Magic numbers in conditionals, functions scattered all over the place, no deletion of unused code, functions names not describing what they do. It’s a mess. Something that should take a day takes three, just because you have to go through the messy code or refactor first, which I think it’s only me who does it anyways.I’ve mentioned my concerns like the usage of magic numbers and only the lead dev reacts. The rest stay silent. They rarely answer questions unless I tag them in the message. It feels like they’re just taking advantage of the fact that the lead dev is a workaholic who works weekends and oversees everything. I get just doing your job and collecting paychecks, but I can’t understand this level of laziness. It’s crazy.I want to push more for clean code practices, but I don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation for anybody, specially if things seem to be working out they way things are now. The lead dev does care, but he’s got too much on his plate and is focused on shipping. He’s the only one reviewing PRs, I understand why he may let things slide. If I’m going to start reviewing PRs and putting more time into raising the quality bar, I want to make sure management sees it.On one hand, I’d love to just keep things chill and cash my check. On the other, it’s frustrating working in this mess and seeing the laziness. Not sure how to move forward. Anyone been in a similar spot?",

I then didn't know how to move forward (there were a lot of frameworks to learn and many ways to build software). I then tried another ventures until 2024. From last one year, I have been building projects, primarily looking for a job to get into IT (any job to step into tech industry).After I listed my resume in a local job listing website, I was getting calls from recruiters, but none of them turned to an interview because of my Zero tech work experience. So I turned to LinkedIn. I started sharing about my projects on LinkedIn and I started to get some response from other people. And then for this project called [AWS FinOps Dashboard](https://github.com/ravikiranvm/aws-finops-dashboard), people responded overwhelmingly. I then got some feedback from people and kept sharing about feature updates on LinkedIn. This project caught attention of hiring managers and I ended up with a Full Stack Dev job.

I understand the utility of AI at the moment but my senior managers are discussing the future of our jobs now and are trying to make our roles “code free” because they believe that coding will be completely taken over by AI. They share articles on companies who have already implemented AI agents alongside regular employees and every team meeting the discussion is about how we can future proof our careers.Since the time I’ve come here, I’ve not had senior managers show interest with me learning any technical skills - like cloud and all. There’s such a strong feeling everything will be taken over by AI but at the same time I feel like my team members aren’t very strong technically where we can even properly identify best practices without AI that I feel AI isn’t going to make that process any better.Has anybody else faced these issues? Is this a company culture problem or am I not doing enough to “future proof” myself. I don’t even know what to learn at this point. I am trying to take some courses to upskill but I also am lost as to what exactly to learn next.",

I dont fear that AI is gonna take my future job but rather mutate it into something that I don't enjoy anymore. Even though I am of the opinion that AI generates crappy software, I also feel like tech companies do not care about the quality of their software and will push towards a \"vibe coding\" development process simply because it's cheaper and faster.I fear that working in software will end up being up wirtting LLM prompts, writting design specifications and debugging AI slop. The prospect of this makes me want to pivot away from software since it takes all the joy away from the profession.I have dedicated so much time to this field and will probably continue working as a hobbyist and contribute to open source. BUT, what am I supposed to do career wise? Where could I pivot to without losing all rhe skills I have learned? Am I overreacting and software development won't change that much?

I'm just terrified right now. My company has had 3 layoffs this year alone, but because they fired so many employees and work still needs to get done, they are heavily, heavily forcing an AI-first workflow on us, where we create a PRD, and spin up multiple agents to get work done, and then just code review what gets generated. I honestly cant stomach it. I became a dev to solve problems... use my knowledge and experience to provide value, this just... isn't it anymore. I'm making 155k a year right now, and I know that any switch is going to cause that to plummet, I'm okay with that.

I have been working extremely hard grinding leetcode, focusing on personal projects, and practicing interviews. I applied to at least 500 jobs and only got called for an interview from 6. Even when my interviews went well, there was always someone better in their eyes. I went to college in a different part of the country, so I don't really have access to those resources anymore. Worst part is how recruiters react when they hear I've been unemployed for 7 months: they either scoff and outright ghost. These all have been taking an extreme toll on my mental health. I've had a few resume reviews 4-5 months ago and all I got were \"it's not you but the current market or \"your profile is extremely strong, keep applying\" but it's only gone downhill from there. I had 4 internships at prestigious companies and all ended with excellent final reports but no return offers due to budget cuts. I'm sending cold messages on LinkedIn constantly but no one responds anymore. All my friends have started ghosting me as well so I can't ask for referrals from them. I can't express how depressed I've been watching all of my peers working at FAANG while I'll be happy to just take any SWE/ML job. I'm happy for them but also upset as I have no idea how to get help. The last call I got from a recruiter, she outright asked me why I don't have a job yet in an extremely condescending manner although that requisition was for someone who graduated within the last year.I'm also a US citizen, so I don't think immigration/visa issues are relevant.I just don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has tips on expanding my network, getting referrals, or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.Tldr; 7 months since graduation and no prospects of new grad roles. Losing all hopes and mental health is in the gutter. Would appreciate advice on building network or anything that'll get me out of this deep pit.",

Too many workers with little to no experience and AI pushing out entry-level stuff is what I've heard. No place for a foothold. Obviously we can't see into the future, but do you guys think it's still worth it to pursue this sector or should I set my sights on something else?EDIT: I just got off work so sorry I haven’t responded much, this got more replies than I counted on!

The thing is the lead started rebuilding the project right when I joined / after the previous dev left. The project has no tests no ci/cd and when I push for it he says we’ll get to it if we get an extra person. I been holding my weight but obviously I’m a little slower than him given he has years of context compared to my almost three months.

Liquid comp would be slightly lower, but there’s big upside in equity… if they succeed it would be better than the current job, if they corner the European market it could be life-changing. I'm afraid of overvaluing the equity or minimizing the stress of working at a start up in my late 30s, and I don't want to burn bridges and then burn out to later be forced to take a worse job than I have now. Also while I am personally confident they are positioned to do well and believe them when they say they have no plans on getting acquired, there's no guarantee of the equity becoming liquid or ultimately being worth much.Personal considerations:I have a mortgage, some debt, and family plans, so stability matters. At the same time, I feel a bit stuck where I am and like the idea of working on something bold. Also the idea of getting a huge payoff is obviously attractive.Any advice or different points of view would be appreciated!",

        "author": "Fair_Border8757",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi all,I graduated in Winter 2024 from a T15 school with a BS in Computer Science. The job market was tough, but after about 5 months of applying, I landed a new grad role. I'm currently working in a cloud infrastructure/devops position, mostly focused on tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines. It's solid experience, but there’s very little actual coding involved. The only other work experience I have was an internship last summer where I built automation tools in Python, but not specifically SWE. I’ve also included some personal and academic backend projects on my resume, but that doesn’t seem to be enough so far to get traction for software engineering roles.Ultimately, I want to pivot into a backend engineering role, where I can focus more on building systems and writing software. I'm grateful for the opportunity I have, but I’m trying to plan out my next steps so I can move in the direction I actually want. From what I've heard, there are no pivot opportunities into dev teams internally as those teams are now offshore. Coincidentally, I am also starting an online, part-time CS masters degree in the Fall. Given how the market is, and since I've had no real work experience in backend, would it be better to apply to internships or full-time roles?",

My Hilbilly degree from Keene State is weak in comparison.I feel like I would have more buying power moving somewhere with more affordable housing and less gatekeeping for small State schools. Maybe I am being naive, but having a degree from a \"Northen school\" may put me in advantage in places like the Research Triangle in North Carolina or Atlanta Georgia.Things are getting unstable at my job and I am considering working at a job, such as manufacturing QA (I currently work in Software QA since 2022) for a year or so, while I save up some money to plan my exit and allow some time for the overall market to get better. I currently make about 62k a year, but I've seen Manufacuring QA post jobs that pay 85k a year or even more. Thoughts?",

During the review, manager cited poor market as I thought he would. I held my position that market does not dictate my salary, my own performance and output does. I also explained that my previous company I'd been with for many years had still given me raises during the recession 2007-09 because \"its a hard time not just for us, but also for you, and we want our people to know they will be rewarded for good performance and hard work\".

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Going to graduate with BS in CS soon from a no name university. I have developed a love for CS theory, specifically in anything related to reducing latency and increasing throughput. For example, distributed systems, compilers, parallel computing, high-performance computing, DSA, core OS, DB internals, CPU architecture.I'm going to be working at Meta as a SWE. Even though I'm joining at E3, I have heard many horror stories of the WLB at Meta so I already have the expectation that I will be working 50 hours per week. Hell, I have seen posts on here that might be exaggerating, but people are claiming to be working 60+ hours per week at Meta. I haven't been team matched yet since they're doing bootcamp this year for E3.With that being said, I have done some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations and I believe if I pursue a Master's part-time, I will only have 15 hours left in my week in total for leisure (e.g. girlfriend, gym, hobbies unrelated to CS). Also, this might put a strain on my performance at work and promo speed, which is very important to me. Moreover, if I focus on work and promo speed, depending on what team I am on I am thinking since I'm in big tech where scale matters, I might already be learning about distributed systems, compilers, and the rest of my interests on the job itself without having to do a Master's. I would lose the actual credential of a Master's degree but I would probably (hopefully) have more impact, greater performance and bonus, less risk of layoff, faster promo speed, etc. at work to offset this. Furthermore, I would use 3-4 years of my early/mid 20s on further schooling, but I'm also not the type to want to party hard all night long or something like that.However, I also see some benefits. For one, I will only pay a total of like $2000 for the entire Master's program. Meta will cover the rest. It's GaTech's OMSCS. Additionally, when I am older, I think it might be fun to become a sessional instructor at my undergrad, which requires a grad degree. I also did some research in undergrad, and I feel like doing a Master's program might potentially open up more opportunities for research in the future. On that note, I'm also interested in the opportunity that this might open up to move into quant dev (not quant trader, researcher, analyst, or any of the \"true quant roles\"). My areas of interest are related to quant dev I believe, and I personally find finance very interesting so I think it might be a good fit. But I also don't think that GaTech OMSCS is a target program for quant firms, so regardless of whether I pursue this or not that door might just be closed.TL;DR: should I do Master's if I already have big tech full-time job lined up? Cons is mostly time commitment which might strain work performance. Pros are potential opportunities a Master's might open and I would genuinely be interested in the content, or at least I loved studying CS in undergrad.",

My major is cs, but I’ve been seriously considering switching to either data science/computer engineering/electrical engineering once I transfer or maybe just sticking with cs.I've come to a realization that programming and web development haven’t really clicked with me or at least that's not what I'm particularly interested in/to do once i graduate. On the other hand, I’ve found myself enjoying classes like calculus, physics, discrete structures, and fundamentals of computer systems, etc a lot more. The two remaining classes in my last sem besides general/electives are software development and data structures so I’m hoping that gives me more clarity but right now I feel kind of lost and unsure about which direction to take.If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has advice on choosing between CS, CE, DS and EE (especially for someone who enjoys the math/theory/structure side more than coding), I’d really appreciate your input.",

        "content": "I thought I should ask engineers with a lot more years of experience and have seen a lot more trends- both ups, and downs - in the tech field.I have a little over 1 YOE in a FAANG company as a SWE. My manager messaged us saying that leadership wants ai to take over all code production very soon and that we should be rapidly working towards that by the end of the year.Of course none of us, including my manager, think that’s possible. He estimates it would take at the very minimum one year, most likely two years, to get the AI tools capable of even helping us efficiently. Not even to take over our code protection. However, he gave us advice that we should present ourselves as AI experts right now. He said we could do that by learning how to use the AI tools to take over small tasks as much possible and teaching others to do the same.So the question is, where do I go from here? Based on these estimates, I could stay at that FAANG company for a few more years and then job hop to a company that hasn’t migrated to AI software. But I also want job security- well the little that is possible in this field. It seems like being a SWE isn’t sustainable long term with the AI migration. Should I start researching other jobs in tech to pivot to? Are there any indications of what that move should be or is it too early to tell?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I feel I am in a unique situation than most. I have about 6-8 years experience (doing range to prevent d*xxing) and have currently 2 gaps of 6-9 months each between jobs. I am working at my third job right now, but everything indicates I may be losing that one possibly soon as well. So now three gaps are at risk.I would say average job tenor was about 2-3 years each jobs (except this one, still here a little under 2 years now).I quit my first job because it was super toxic, like I was having health issues because of it. Second gap is due to a layoff, but I was really doing well at that job. This one seems to be a downturn in the company as well. I was doing fine at job based on ratings.I just don't know how to overcome to bias that seems to come with this. I can not lie on my application about timelines, because every job I have taken asks for a background check. Sure, I found my current job with 2 gaps on application, but I don't know about three.I don't care about the gaps financially, I have savings to last for it. But there does seem to be some bias against this. I know I was pressed by one recruiter who specifically treated me like I was hiding something due to the gaps. As if I was a poor performer who kept losing his job. I also sometimes wonder if that is why I wasn't getting some responses back on jobs. Only reason I have my current job is mainly because of a connection I had.So, how do I handle this? What can I do to prevent his being an issue?The job market is horrible right now, even for an experienced dev like me. I have thrown a few applications out there and usually would at least get a recruiter calling me, nothing. There is nothing wrong with my application. I've already had it reviewed and it worked fine in my last job search (that was even without a job at the time. I still have my job right now). Granted, I only did a few to test the waters though. But I would at least expect a call back on one.Does anyone have advice on this specific topic? I feel frankly worried I need to change careers here soon.",

        "content": "Hello!I apologize if this is only tangentially related to CS and this might be a mini-rant. I'm a Senior Software Engineer and I make about $130k. I work remote and my day-to-day is usually about 2-3 hours of development and half an hour of code reviews. I often take days off and I don't work on most Fridays. While this is a very comfortable situation, I feel very unfulfilled. The obvious, (to me), solution would be to use all my down time to have a side-project but I tried working on a solo app or a game or thinking of my own business. None of these make me happy and I just feel bored of most things. I usually leave the house and walk around the mall just to do something with my day because I have nothing else to do.While I am a critical part of the team, my company is getting more and more manager-based and I'm no longer being asked for architecture input, but I am still being relied upon for development tasks. I have spoken about this to a couple of managers, and while they seem like they understand, I haven't seen any change in this. This isn't a huge deal-breaker and I think I'm looking for _any_ change in order to be less bored.While I think that my feelings are caused by me being idle, I also think what would happen if I wasn't. I don't think I would be any happier if I was busy, and I think I need a complete career change. What is scary to me is that I would need to find something with a comparable salary. I have been looking passively looking looking for another job in my field, (about 5-10 applications every 2 months), but I have only had 2 interviews in 2 years. Maybe I would have more luck if I searched for something in an entirely different field? But would that job also let me work remote and be mostly unsupervised?I apologize if my situation would be somebody's \"dream job\", and I don't want to sound ungrateful. If somebody else has been in a similar position, I would love to know if they have a solution.",
