        "content": "TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platformI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.Now, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENTEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).Obviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).I’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.How do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",

I had built some simple webapps with flask before, but this is the first time I have worked with a \"batteries included\"web framework to a significant extent. One thing that strikes me is the gap in maturity between DE and Web Dev. Here are some examples:1. Most DE literature is pretty recent. For example, the first edition of \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" was written in 20222. Lack of opinionated frameworks. Come to think of it, I think DBT is pretty much what we got.3. Lack of well-defined patterns or consensus for practices like testing, schema evolution, version control, etc.Data engineering is much more \"unsolved\" than other software engineering fields. I'm not saying this is a bad thing. On the contrary, I think it is very exciting to work on a field where there is still a lot of room to be creative and be a part of figuring out how things should be done rather than just copy whatever existing pattern is the standard.",

Even other teams commonly call us \"devs.\"This has me wondering:Is this just common industry language?Or is it a sign that the data engineering role is being blended into general development work?Do you also feel that your work is viewed more like backend/dev work than a specialized data role?Just curious how others experience this.

        "content": "Hey all, I lurk in this sub daily. I’m looking for advice / thoughts / brutally honest opinions on how to move my career forward. About me: 37 year old senior data engineer of 5 years, senior data analyst of about 10 years, 15 years in total working with data. Been at it since college. I have a bachelors degree in economics and a handful of certs including AWS solutions architect associate. I am married with a 1 year old, planning on having at least one more (I think this family info is relevant bc lifestyle plays into career decisions, like the one I’m trying to make). Live / work in Austin, TX. I love data engineering, and I do want to further my career in the role, but am apprehensive given all the AI f*ckery about. I have basically nailed it down to three options:1. Get a masters in CS or AI. I actually do really like the idea of this. I enjoy math, the theory and science, and having a graduate degree is an accolade I want out of life (at least I think). What holds me back: I will need to take some extra pre-req courses and will need to continue working while studying. I anticipate a 5 year track for this (and about $15-20k). This will also be difficult while raising a family. And more pertinently, does this really protect me from AI? I think it will definitely help in the medium term, but who knows if it’d be worth it ten years from now. 2. Continue pressing on as a data engineer, and try to bump up to Staff and then maybe move into some sort of management role. I definitely want the staff position, but ugh being a manager does not feel like my forte. I’ve done it before as an Analytics Manager and hated it. Granted, I was much younger then, and the team I managed was not the most talented. So my last experience is probably not very representative. 3. Get out of Data Engineering and move into something like Sales Engineering. This is a bit out of left field, but I think something like this is probably the best bet to future proof my tech career without an advanced degree. Personally, I haven’t had a full-on sales role before, but the sales thing is kind of in my blood, as my parents and family were quite successful in sales roles. I do enjoy people, and think I could make a successful tech salesman, given my experience as a data engineer. After reading this, what do you feel might be a good path for me? One or the other, a mix of both? I like the idea of going for the masters in CS and moving into Sales Engineering afterwards. Overall I am eager to learn and advance while also being mindful of the future changes coming to the industry (all industries really). Thank you!",

        "title": "Data Engineer Feeling Lost: Is This Consulting Norm, or Am I Doing It Wrong?",
        "author": "human_disaster_92",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm at a point in my career where I feel pretty lost and, honestly, a bit demotivated. I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on whether what I'm going through is just 'normal' in consulting, or if I'm somehow attracting all the least desirable projects.I've been working at a tech consulting firm (or 'IT services company,' as I'd call it) for 3 years, supposedly as a Data Engineer. And honestly, my experiences so far have been... peculiar.”My first year was a baptism by fire. I was thrown into a legacy migration project, essentially picking up mid-way after two people suddenly left the company. This meant I spent my days migrating processes from unreadable SQL and Java to PySpark and Python. The code was unmaintainable, full of bad practices, and the PySpark notebooks constantly failed because, obviously, they were written by people with no real Spark expertise. Debugging that was an endless nightmare.Then, a small ray of light appeared: I participated in a project to build a data platform on AWS. I had to learn Terraform on the fly and worked closely with actual cloud architects and infrastructure engineers. I learned a ton about infrastructure as code and, finally, felt like I was building something useful and growing professionally. I was genuinely happy!But the joy didn't last. My boss decided I needed to move to something \"more data-oriented\" (his words). And that's where I am now, feeling completely demoralized.Currently, I'm on a team working with Microsoft Fabric, surrounded by Power BI folks who have very little to no programming experience. Their philosophy is \"low-code for everything,\" with zero automation. They want to build a Medallion architecture and ingest over 100 tables, using one Dataflow Gen2 for EACH table. Yes, you read that right.This translates to:- Monumental development delays.- Cryptic error messages and infernal debugging (if you've ever tried to debug a Dataflow Gen2, you know what I mean).- A strong sense that we're creating massive technical debt from day one.I've tried to explain my vision, pushed for the importance of automation, reducing technical debt, and improving maintainability and monitoring. But it's like talking to a wall. It seems the technical lead, whose background is solely Power BI, doesn't understand the importance of these practices nor has the slightest intention of learning.I feel like, instead of progressing, I'm actually moving backward professionally. I love programming with Python and PySpark, and designing robust, automated solutions. But I keep landing on ETL projects where quality is non-existent, and I see no real value in what we're doing—just \"quick fixes and shoddy work.\"I have the impression that I haven't experienced what true data engineering is yet, and that I'm professionally devaluing myself in these kinds of environments.My main questions are:- Is this just my reality as a Data Engineer in consulting, or is there a path to working on projects with good practices and real automation?- How can I redirect my career to find roles where quality code, automation, and robust design are valued?- Any advice on how to address this situation with my current company (if there's any hope) or what to actively look for in my next role?Any similar experiences, perspectives, or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!",

Obviously, dbt wouldn’t have changed their license to ELv2 if they weren’t confident that fusion was the strongest SQL-based transformation engine.So this brings me to my question- for the core functionality of understanding SQL, does anyone know the technological/architectural differences between the two? How they differ in approaches? Their limitations? Where one’s implementation is better than the other?",

This time, I already have the title, so expectations are higher from day one.I’d appreciate advice from others who’ve gone through similar transitions. A few points I’m navigating:1. **More coordination, less coding** – I feel responsible when junior/mid-level teammates struggle, but stepping in often requires deep context and isn’t always the best use of my time.2. **Initial pressure to speak up** – In early meetings, I spoke a lot out of fear of being judged. I’ve since shifted to only contributing when others are stuck, letting the team lead conversations.3. **High-stakes communication** – I’m regularly presenting and defending solutions to groups of 5–10 senior stakeholders (including weekly 2-3 min updates to 100+ people). I feel it is it's own skillset and would like tips or recommendations on courses for such situations.4. **Perception concerns** – I’m worried my informal tone and young appearance (I'm 28 but look 24) might make me seem immature for the role.Looking for strategies to succeed as a new senior in a new team.",

This is not mentioned anywhere in the contract, and you get to know only after joining and paying the amount.When I asked why can’t I access and why is this not menioned in the contract, their response was, it is written in the contract what we offer, which is misleading. In the initial calls before joining, they emphasized more on these courses as an highlight.- Had to ping multiple times to get a basic review on CV.- 1:1 session can only be scheduled twice with a coach. There are many students enrolled now, and very few coaches are available. Sometimes, the availability of the coaches is more than 2 weeks away.- Coaches and their teams response time is quite slow. Sometimes the coaches don’t even respond. Only 1:1 was a good experience.- Sometimes the group sessions gets cancelled with no prior information, and they provide no platform to check if the session will begin or not.- Job application process and their follow ups are below average. They did not follow the job location preference and where just randomly appling to any DE role irrespective of which level you belong to.- For the job applications, they initially showed a list of referrals supported, but were not using that during the application process. Had to intervene multiple times, and then only a few of those companies from the referral list were used. - Had to start applying on my own, as their job search process was not that reliable.————————————————————————Overall, except the 1:1 with the coaches, I felt there was no benefit. They take a hughe amount, instead taking multiple online DE courses would have been a better option.",

        "content": "Hi,I had some fun creating a Python tool that hides a secret payload in a DataFrame. The message is encoded based on row order, so the data itself remains unaltered.The payload can be recovered even if some rows are modified or deleted, thanks to a combination of Reed-Solomon and fountain codes. You only need a fraction of the original dataset—regardless of which part—to recover the payload.For example, I managed to hide a 128×128 image in a Parquet file containing 100,000 rows.I believe this could be used to watermark a Parquet file with a signature for authentication and tracking. The payload can still be retrieved even if the file is converted to CSV or SQL.That said, the payload is easy to remove by simply reshuffling all the rows. However, if you maintain the original order using a column such as an ID, the encoding will remain intact.Here’s the package, called Steganodf (like steganography for DataFrames :) )::link: https://github.com/dridk/steganodfLet me know what you think!",

As you can see I’m still new to this which is why I didn’t have enough information to provide but …. In a season we have 3TB of video footage hoooweeveerr this is from all games in our league so even the ones we don’t play in. I can prioritize all our games only and that should be 350 GB data (I think) now ofcourse it wouldn’t be uploaded all at once but based off of last years data I have not seen a singular game file over 11.5 GB. I’m unsure how much practice footages we have but I’ll see. Oh also I put our files in ChatGPT and it’s “.SCTimeline , stream.json , video.json and package meta” Chat game me a hopefully this information helps.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.About a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.I now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouseSome conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!What I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.My question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment. Any things I am not thinking about that will sooner or later come to haunt me in my DE team? Any tips on how to setup my DWH architecture? How does your DWH look conceptually?",

        "author": "jduran9987",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,I've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.My background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example: -- modelB.sql SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }} This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks. TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?Thanks!",

I got decent grades, but I wasn’t top of my class — not good enough to unlock prestigious scholarships or academic opportunities.Right now, I’m trying to figure out what really makes a difference when trying to grow professionally in this field, especially for someone without an exceptional academic track record. I’m ambitious and constantly learning, and I want to grow fast and reach high-impact roles, ideally abroad in the future.Some questions I’m grappling with:•Are certifications (like the Snowflake one) worth it for standing out?•Would a private master’s or MBA from a well-known school help open doors, even if I’m not doing it for the learning itself? If so, which ones are actually respected in the data world?•I’m also working on personal projects (investment tools, dashboards) that I use for myself and publish on GitHub. Is it worth adapting them for the public or making them more portfolio-ready?I’d love to hear from others who were in a similar position: what helped you stand out? What do hiring managers and companies actually value when considering junior profiles?Thanks a lot!",

Therefore, my only choice is to create a combined Type 2 SCD. The only 2 options I can think of:- determine the overlapping date ranges and JOIN each table on the overlapped date ranges. Downsides would be it’s not scalable assuming I have several tables. This also becomes tricky with incremental - explode each individual table to a daily grain then join on the new “activity date” field. Downsides would be massive increase in data volume. Also incremental is difficultI feel like I’m overthinking this. Any suggestions?",

We have some rockstar DBA's, but they're older and have basically never touched cloud services or \"big\" data. Integrations are SSIS packages and scripts that are kind of in version control, data testing is manual, data analysts have no ability to define or alter tables even though they know the SQL. The business is expanding! It's a good place to be. As we expand, it's challenging our existing model. Our speed of execution is showing the bottlenecks around the DBA team, with one Hero Dev doing the majority of the work. They're wrapped up in application changes, warehouse changes, and analytics changes, and feel like they have to touch every part of the process or else everything will break (because again, tests are manual and we're only kind of doing version control).I'm working with the team on how we can address this. My plan is something like:* Break responsibility apart into the different teams * Application team is responsible for the application DB * DBA team is responsible for the system of record data warehouse and integrations and consults on design decisions * Analytics team is responsible for reports, \\*including any underlying SQL and reporting warehouse structure\\** Advocate for my Hero Dev to take a promotion towards a data architect and design consulting role bridging the teams, with other DBA's taking on more of the development.* Work on adding automated testing to our existing SSIS packages, then work towards having them built into a CI/CD process* Work with the analyst team on having their own server + database where they can use a framework or even Fabric to manage their tables and semantic layer themselves.I acknowledge this is a super high-level plan with a lot of hand-waving. However, I'd love to hear if any of you have run this route before. If you have, how did it go? What bit you, what do you wish you had known, what would you do next time?Thanks",

        "content": "Hey folks,I'm leading a greenfield initiative to build a modern data engineering platform at a medium sized healthcare organization, and I’d love to crowdsource some insights from this community — especially from those who have done something similar or witnessed it done well (or not-so-well :grimacing_face:).We're designing from scratch, so I have a rare opportunity (and responsibility) to make intentional decisions about architecture, tooling, processes, and team structure. This includes everything from ingestion and transformation patterns, to data governance, metadata, access management, real-time vs. batch workloads, DevOps/CI-CD, observability, and beyond.**Our current state:** We’re a heavily on-prem SQL Server shop with a \\~40 TB relational reporting database . We have a small Azure footprint but aren’t deeply tied to it — so we’re not locked in to a specific cloud or architecture and have some flexibility to choose what best supports scalability, governance, and long-term agility.What I’m hoping to tap into from this community:* “I wish we had done X from the start”* “Avoid Y like the plague”* “One thing that made a huge difference for us was…”* “Nobody talks about Z, but it became a big problem later”* “If I were doing it again today, I would definitely…”We’re evaluating options for lakehouse architectures (e.g., Snowflake, Azure, DuckDB/Parquet, etc.), building out a scalable ingestion and transformation layer, considering dbt and/or other semantic layers, and thinking hard about governance, security, and how we enable analytics and AI down the line.I’m also interested in team/process tips. What did you do to build healthy team workflows? How did you handle documentation, ownership, intake, and cross-functional communication in the early days?Appreciate any war stories, hard-won lessons, or even questions you wish someone had asked you when you were just getting started. Thanks in advance — and if it helps, I’m happy to follow up and share what we learn along the way.– OP",

Here are some insights:\\- I am the only person on the team capable of filtering an Excel table and reading/creating a pivot table, and I only work very part-time on data management --> the platform must not bug often and must have a veryyyyy user-friendly interface (this takes PowerBI out of the equation)\\- We have about 6 different Excel files on the cloud to integrate, all together under a GB of data for now. Within a couple of years, it may pass this point.\\- Non-profit pricing or a free basic version is best!\\- The ability to display 'live' (from true live up to weekly refreshes) major data points on a public website is a huge plus.\\- I had an absolute nightmare of a time getting a Tableau Trial set up and the customer service was unable to fix a bug on the back end that prevented my email from setting up a demo, so they're out.",

I'm by no means an expert and would like to make sure I'm understanding the concept first. Is this article claiming that if I have, say, a dim\\_customers table, that to widen that table with customer attributes like location, sign up date, size, etc. that I will create a brittle architecture? To me this seems like a standard practice, as long as you are maintaining the grain of the table (1 customer per record). I also might use this table to join in all of the ids from various source systems. This makes it easy to investigate issues and increases the tables reusability IMO.Am I misunderstanding the article maybe, or is there a better, more scalable approach than what I'm currently doing in my own work?

May 15th business data originally extracted on May 15th → goes to May 15th partition2. Backfill more May 15th data on June 1st → goes to June 1st partition3.

Is there a clean way to handle this pattern without full refresh?2. Should I be partitioning by business date instead of extraction date?3. Would switching to `merge` strategy be better here?4. Any other approaches to handle backfills gracefully?The latest record pattern works great for the source tables, but the extraction-date partitioning on insights tables creates this blind spot. Backfills are rare so considering just doing full refresh when they happen, but curious if there's a more elegant solution.Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m working as a data engineer on a project that follows a Medallion Architecture in Synapse, with bronze and silver layers on Spark, and the gold layer built using Serverless SQL.For a specific task, the requirement is to replicate multiple source views exactly as they are — without applying transformations or modeling — directly from the source system into the gold layer. In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.While working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.I’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.What would you do in this case?Would you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "TL;DR: We have a website and a D365 CRM that we currently keep synchronized through Power Automate, and this is rather terrible. What's a good avenue for better centralising our data for reporting? And what would be a good tool for pulling this data into the central data source?As the title says, we work in procurement for education institutions providing frameworks and the ability to raise tender requests free of charge, while collecting spend from our suppliers.Our development team is rather small with about 2-3 web developers (including our tech lead) and a data analyst. We have good experience in PHP / SQL, and rather limited experience in Python (although I have used it).We have our main website, a Laravel site that serves as the main point of contact for both members and suppliers with a Quote Tool (raising tenders) and Spend Reporter (suppliers tell us their revenue through us). The data for this is currently in a MariaDB / MySQL database. The VM for this is currently hosted within Azure.We then have our CRM, a dynamics 365 / PowerApps Model App(?) that handles Member & Supplier data, contacts, and also contains the framework data same as the site. Of course, this data is kept in Microsoft Data verse.These 2 are kept in sync using an array of Power Automate flows that run whenever a change is made on either end, and attempts to synchronise the two. It uses an API built in Laravel to contact the website data. To keep it realtime, there's an Azure Service bus for the messages sent on either end. A custom connector is used to access the API in Power Automate.We also have some other external data sources such as information from other organisations we pull into Microsoft Dataverse using custom connectors or an array of spreadsheets we get from them.Finally, we also have sources such as SharePoint, accounting software, MailChimp, a couple of S3 buckets, etc, that would be relevant to at least mention.Our reports are generally built in Power BI. These reports are generally built using the MySQL server as a source (although they have to be manually refreshed when connecting through an SSH tunnel) for some, and the Dataverse as the other source.We have licenses to build PowerBI reports that ingest data from any source, as well as most of the power platform suite. However, we don't have a license for Microsoft Fabric at the moment.We also have an old setup of Synapse Analytics alongside an Azure SQL database that as far as I can tell neither of these are really being utilised right now.So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised? We've been looking at Snowflake as an option for a data store as well as (maybe?) for ETL/ELT. Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.Additionally, a big requirement is moving away from Power Automate for handling real time ETL processes as this causes far too many problems than solutions. Ideally, the 2-way sync would be kept as close to real-time as possible.So, what would be a good option for central data storage? And what would be a good option for then running data synchronisation and preparation for building reports?I think options that have been on the table either from personal discussions or with a vendor are:- including Azure Data Factory alongside Synapse for ETL- Microsoft Fabric - Snowflake- Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)- using more Power Query (simple, but only for ingesting data into Dataverse)I can answer questions for any additional context if needed, because I can imagine more will be needed.",

A Kafka Streams-based Java application will consume and process these events.* **Target Systems:** Two downstream SQL Server databases: * **ODS Silver**: Denormalized ingestion with transformations (KTable joins) * **ODS Gold**: Curated materialized views optimized for analytics* **Additional concerns we're addressing:** * Parent-child out-of-order scenarios * Sequencing and buffering of transactions * Event deduplication * Minimal impact on source systems (logical decoding, no outbox pattern)This is a new pattern for our organization, so I’m especially interested in hearing from folks who’ve built or operated similar architectures.**Questions:**1. How did you handle transaction boundaries and ordering across multiple topics?2. Did you use a custom sequencer, or did you rely on Flink/Kafka Streams or another framework?3.

I also understand that, as a hobbyist with no higher education or degree, that I'm not going to ever write profession production C++ code. But dear goodness, they way people talk about C++ sometimes. I hear a lot of people say that \"It isn't even worth learning\". I understand that you need a ton of understanding and experience to write performant C++ code. And that even decent Python code will outperform bad/mediocre C++ code. I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. But people make it sound like you're better of sticking to ASM instead. As if any level of fluency is unattainable, save for a select few chosen.",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Before saying anything I would like to preface that this is my first time posting in a subreddit, so if I did something wrong somehow I apologize in advance (I chose the resource tag because my main question concerns choosing resources to learn).I have currently completed my second year in uni and am in the midst of my 3-month summer break. I want to spend these three months focusing on learning full stack development (which for now is my career goal ig), and specifically web development. I have this obsession with doing online courses and improving my skills to get better, and I'm also really looking to do some solid projects and start building my resume/cv. I scoured the internet and found multiple recommended courses which I've listed below. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of just hoarding work and trying to do everything without a plan and regardless of whether it is redundant or not. Here are the courses I gathered:- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)- [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j:toc)- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) courses (HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript)- [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) -> [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)- [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript and FrontEnd course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)- [freecodecamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)- The roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)- [This roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vcu5lm/comment/icgeukp/?context=3) by NiagaraThistleI want to know which of these courses would be enough for me to become skilled at web dev and also set me on the path to becoming a full stack dev. I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.To preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.I also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.Again would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not here to ask the usual, lazy \"learned programming at 26! how become better programmer! also how get job?\" Because, yeah, I know how to become a better programmer: \"do projects,\" they all say. \"Solve a real world problem that you have.\" But every legitimate programmer out there needs to acknowledge that there's a world of computer general knowledge that's typically necessary for many of these \"projects\" to function. Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? Maybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say \"what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff.\" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge? YouTube tutorials on \"how to build [complicated thingy],\" by necessity, gloss over the important details behind the inner workings of lines of code, because otherwise the video would rabbit-hole quite quickly.",

It’s incredibly frustrating.Lately, I’ve started to feel like maybe I’m just not cut out for this. Like I’m too late, too slow, or just not smart enough.

If you're already good at programming, you might find this tool helpful. But if you're just starting out, I think it's actually a bad idea. It takes away the learning-by-doing aspect of coding.

I graduated last May and and I'm performing well at my job as a SWE, but most of that is modifying existing code in a huge codebase, not really starting anything from scratch. For my own learning and for future career growth, I'd want to develop these skills, and basically be able to say that I can build my own application from end-to-end. How do I start? I was considering just going through the Odin Project, but it seems geared towards complete beginners and as a way to get your foot in the door for your first job. Would that still be useful for me? Is there something that's a bit more accelerated or condensed? Should I even be trying to learn how to do this manually, or focus more on getting comfortable with AI tools to build these things out for me?",

        "content": "Disclaimer: I still consider myself \"new\" to programming. I'm not an expert by any means. I just want to share my story.Ever since I started listening to discussions surrounding memory management, I've had a growing interest in C/C++. Several months ago, I began studying open source C++ repositories and trying to put together all the pieces of a mostly complete program. It was a disaster, honestly. I quickly came to realize that my first impression of programming was overly simplistic and due for a refactor. I depended on the verbose nature of Java more than I thought I did. I took for granted all the things the Java Virtual Machine handled automatically until I was introduced to header files and Cmake. I'd argue this is one of the most important recognitions I've made about programming in general so far. It made me focus more on compiler behavior, pre-compile tasks, and all the madness going on in the terminal rather than just how good I can code, follow exception messages or solve surface level problems.My advice for new learners of C or C++: 1. Be very patient with it. Take extended breaks (burnout can occur quickly)2. The coding part will mostly be simple following a tutorial. It's everything else regarding the compiler tasks, headers, proper linking, and so on that will be troubling because it's not common for Java programmers to deal with that.3. Reading code others wrote in C++ will be madness, but it is necessary for learning. Stay resilient. You'll eventually start following the logic more easily.4. There are several C/C++ compilers out there. make sure you're choosing the one the project you're looking at expects. It's been an unexpected sticking point for me. People say the compiler won't make any meaningful difference in performance, which can be mistaken as saying the compiler choice doesn't matter at all. It will matter, just not for performance.5. Cmake is a friend, not a foe. Follow its instructions and download the CMake UI so you can see all the missing data at once. It'll mostly be seen in large projects.6. Building a project is less about the code itself and more about file linking. Pointing the compiler to all associated files is top priority to learn (in my opinion)7. C/C++ makes no assumptions about your platform. That's more significant than I first imagined. It's another thing the JVM handles under the hoodIf I am misguided about any of this, please let me know. Drop some stories in the comments about your learning experience as well and I'll happily read them",

Maybe in the future I'll learn Docker and use containerization for my deployment, but for now it is not required.For the frontend, I can deploy it to Vercel. Pretty easy. But for the backend I am overwhelmed with choices. I've heard that Vercel doesn't support WebSockets so it's out of the list. After some exploring, I saw a couple of options I can pick from.* Use VPS for the hosting such as Hetzner or DigitalOcean* Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP* Cloud platforms such as Render, Heroku, RailwayFor a small portfolio/hobby project, which one of these is my best bet? What are the pros and cons? Keep in mind that I am a college student (broke) so free tier is preferred. But if it means getting better services, paying 4 or 5 dollars a month is alright.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Came across with them via a sponsored video and ran through a few threads here about what people think about it.Let this be the newest one on them:Gamifying the learning process is a clever idea getting more and more adopted by especially more arduous skill acquisition like that of programming.Although [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) promotes on it, \"gaming\" is not emphasized. It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.\"Holding hands\" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.However, that's where their \"Socratic\" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.I did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by \"look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free\" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.I am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.I am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \\- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from. Programming-wise, I think there would be better people who are seasoned enough to comment on their curriculum and pace of progress.Cheers.",

I do not have much interest in web development or some of the other traditional things beginners get involved in, or are recommended to start at, but rather in some open source projects that I am very fond of. Some are C language developed projects, some are c++ (open source games mostly).So here's where I'm stuck: From what I gather, c++ is more difficult overall for a beginner to learn than c, but the open source projects I would be interested in that are in c are likely more difficult to get a handle on as a beginner. So I'm not sure if I go with the higher difficulty lang or higher skill-floor projects? Secondly, I'm on an absolute poopoo of a laptop :D it's this old thinkpad I'm going to strip and put linux on. It has an SSD but is an old i3 (dual-core 2.1GHz Intel Core i3-2310M CPU) from like 12 years ago or whatever (thinkpad x220i aww yeah) so there will be some hardware limitations. (another checkmark for C maybe?)Thankfully, it's 2025 and there is a TON of resources online for getting started with both languages, and discord servers to support it are just amazing. (wish I had this stuff 20 years ago when I tried this the last time!) However I want to try and get as deep as I can with learning CS and contributing as quickly as I can so I want to focus on just one technology or stack. Suggestions or input? Thanks!",

I'm learning C# through that course right now and I love it. I'm not good at programming, I'm very new to it, however programming and gaming are the only two things I can just lose time on. When I'm working on programming something I can just completely focus and zone in, and straight code for like nine hours, (I haven't tried any longer than that as of now). Next year I plan to go to university and study computer science (Don't worry I only plan on using that degree to get a cybersecurity job as it's the closest thing to a cybersec qualification where I live, also compsci is not oversaturated where I live unlike in America.) Overall I'm quite interested in cybersecurity and programming, and would like to get a career relating to one of those some day. So that's my career plan but right now I'm just wondering what should I learn? I have literally zero idea. I'm already learning C# but would love to learn more, and it would drive me if they had a specific use that I could use, because to be quite frank I don't want to learn a language that'll be useless to me.",

It's been interesting, and I've learned a lot, but from what I've read online, a large portion of being a Software Engineer is continuous learning, even outside of formal schooling.I have no issues with this, I like learning. Ive been trying to do my own research into the field (mostly by googling) to deepen my understanding, but, honestly, I have no idea where to really start. I think I have a reasonable grasp on C++, Java, and Python, and can create programs that typically do what I want in the console, but where do I progress from there? Where do I focus my independent studying next to become an effective engineer? And once I have an area of focus, where do I start? To be more specific, when learning a coding language, typically the classes I've taken start by teaching you different variables, then move on to teaching if-else branches, then loops, etc. How do I figure out what the equivalent would be for learning, say, how to create user interfaces, or accessing databases through code, or other things that go into making a program that I'm not aware of? I hope that makes sense, any advice would be appreciated. Edit: I suppose I should also mention that I HAVE picked up a book, specifically the Pragmatic Programmer, but from what I've read it seems primarily best-practice and mindset oriented, where I'm looking to improve on the technical side as well.",

I do much better with in-depth explanations; if I were using a library that abstracted away some task I would be more focused on *how the library works* than just accepting that it does a job and using it. I feel as though this is a big issue with my skills as a programmer. I particularly struggle with OOP and abstracting what I want from a system into various aspects. Concepts as a whole tend to confuse me at first and I need a real concrete understanding before \"getting it\". This leads to me feeling stupid for taking so long whereas others seem more able to understand new concepts, regardless of the topic being taught (although that could just be perceived). What steps can I take to improving this skill and understanding / reasoning with concepts in a way that doesn't require in-depth knowledge? I hope my question comes across clear, but please let me know if other wise and I will try and clear that up.Many thanks",

        "content": "Hi guys.As the title says, what exactly makes a project advanced?I inititally thought it was a bit arbitrary and subjective. I am a little more confident in this, in that off the top of my head the following are potential grounds can elevate a basic project to a more advanced and portfolio worthy one:1. Usage of (appropriate) design patterns2. Scalability, and performance considerations3. Big O complexity considerations and usage of relevant, appropriate data structures4. Inclusion of additional functionality, so if I had a to do app, including it to be available on mobile/cloud (such as using streamlit from python) would elevate it5. Real world/life functionality, such as expansion of use cases to encompass practical, business domains and situations.6. A project that is specific/applicable to a specific domain, such as an anti-money laundering detection project within banking, or fraud detection within a commercial website/ banking7. Good code practices: clean, concise, modular code, with adherence to principles such as Single Responsibility Principle for functions, usage of seperation of concerns, abstracting data from logic8. actually including a well-written README file that details the functionality and use cases associated with the project within the git/github repository, with appropriate commenting of novel/atypical processes within the program.9. Adherence and implemention of SOLID principles, and generally high rates of cohesion and low rates of coupling.",

Go to some of the ai subreddits and you'll see \"addicted to getting things done\", \"improved productivity\" everywhere. I like to use ai as an assistant but some of the posts I read straight up saying they have 0 knowledge and the ai did all the work of 8 months in 72 hours... what are your thoughts on this situation? (I wrote ai but maybe more accurate to say LLM). Vibe coding and vibe coders were a joke but from their own experiences it seems like they are \"getting things done\".

        "content": "Hi everyone!I'm new to programming and drawn to the field because I'm fascinated by how programmers can envision ideas and bring them to life through code. However, I'm struggling with two main challenges that are holding me back.First, I'm having trouble with the fundamentals of problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks. Despite watching tutorials, reading forums, and attempting LeetCode problems, everything feels overwhelming. I suspect I need to start even more basic than most beginners - perhaps at what I'd call a \"level -1.\" To address this, I'm planning to work with a tutor who can help me build a solid foundation before I try to learn independently.Second, I'm unsure about which programming specialization to pursue. This uncertainty stems partly from my lack of confidence, but I now understand that working on personal projects is crucial for growth. Previously, I relied solely on LeetCode and books like \"How to Think Like a Programmer\" by Anton Spraul, but this community has shown me these should only supplement hands-on practice, not replace it.My main question is: Can I develop core programming skills that would transfer to any specialization I eventually choose - whether that's web development, DevOps, cloud engineering, or something else? Would it be better to pick a beginner-friendly area like web development to start with, or are there specific foundational projects and practices that would serve me well regardless of my eventual path?I'm open to any guidance you can offer, and I plan to utilize resources like tutoring, online communities, and Discord servers to support my learning journey.",

I'm in my first semester of an Associate's Degree in Systems Analysis and Development (ADS), taking a JS/HTML/CSS course, and trying to build a project for my wife's company.ADS Degree: I'm pretty much half-assing this first semester because of the subjects. I just let the lectures play in the background while I do other things, then I take the test and that's it.JS/HTML/CSS Course: I started with a programming logic course and then jumped straight into this one.The Project: I'm building it with the help of Gemini Pro, and I think it's a relatively simple project. It's being developed with several technologies like Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and others.What I'd like to get your opinion on is this: I've paused my JS/HTML/CSS course to focus on the project, because everyone keeps saying the best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Since I have no experience, I ask the AI to give me a step-by-step guide of what we're going to do, followed by the code with a line-by-line explanation of its functionality. I finish by writing the lines myself and questioning some parts (which has led to more work, as I end up making it more robust than the AI's initial version and then have to make changes throughout the project).Do you think I should carry on like this, or should I go back to the course and build smaller projects related to the lessons? And also, should I be doing LeetCode/Codewars, etc.?I really appreciate anyone who read all of this, and even more so anyone who's willing to reply. :)",

It's my last semester in college taking CSIS, which for the past 2 semester I havent coded/program so approx 6 months. In the span of 6 months life happened, got my first car stolen, failed my first course(same time my car got stolen), and more..(life happens to everyone so no big deal just takes time). As it's my last semester, I'm trying to get back into my groove of programming and building meaningful projects, which in my head i was over complicating things(is learning c++ better than..? Is making your own compiler better? Is making an application or full stack application with users better? which stack is better to use?) then i came across this growing tech youtuber that was offering paid mentorship. What made him stand out to me? His idea in building application by yourself with guidance. He will collaborate with you in helping you build your idea. It also came to my head that maybe he can guide me in what are things i need to improve on? because I love getting better every single day no matter how small it is. Its just I dont know how to improve or what to improve on... Its like in sports you can determine what to improve on. But with programming i cant determine it. I'm coming to this mentorship with this mindset, but then when i got in and i was questioning if i should continue even though it wasnt even a week yet? Why? Because one of the first module is basic javascript, html and css, which of course i understand that it is needed to have that \"hidden handshake\" that you know what you're doing. So i felt is this only for people transitioning from other jobs to tech? or trying out tech? The other modules are locked until certain days. I've built numerous full stack application using react, node, mongoDB, Vue, Springboot, PHP Laravel because it was a project for my classes. In which, I haven't touched up on it for 6 months. I was taking theory based classes in the 2 semester i wasnt programing/coding(Of course its only an excuse i know).Which currently before i bit the bullet doing the mentorship, I'm learning react native because i got an idea for an app and i want to leverage Java spring boot in it because that's my most backend ive done.In so, my main predicament is should i continue doing the beginner modules of html, css and javascript(again context of ive learnt this in the past already so) or continue learning react native and retouch my skills in using Java(spring boot) to fully make the app or ask the mentor how i should move forward in this program in regards of my skills currently? Idk what to prioritize... plus i still have my last semester. Any feedback or criticism is welcome :) pls..",

        "content": "Background - I'm a senior engineer with 10yrs+ experience that has worked at a few Big Tech companies and startups. I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech \"influencers\" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.The last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.Some of the crazy things I've heard* \"I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations\" (director to his managers)* \"If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does\" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now* \"If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job\" (engineers to other engineers) * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.* \"Working nights and weekends is expected\" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends). * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently. Final thoughts* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be \"passionate\" about making a bunch of money, or \"passionate\" about the product to survive.* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",

Here is how I would break it down.1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \\- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \\- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \\- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \\- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.**How I prepared:*** Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.I know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off! I was looking for a job for 9 months until I got this opportunity lmao. Ask me anything!**Soft Plug:**Building a [website](https://chenaaron3.github.io/drawcode/) to visualize code!

        "content": "Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.Why SWE is the best:* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager \"Hey I'll be away this afternoon\" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.So yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.What do you guys think? Feel free to add your own points as I'm sure I missed a ton of things.",

Master's in Cybersecurity. I can script, I know my way around networks, I've deployed everything from ELK stacks to Kubernetes clusters.But apparently none of that matters because:**\"We need someone with 5+ years experience\"** \\- Dude, I have 4+ years in IT, just not all in the same role. Why does teaching cybersecurity to students not count as experience? Why does implementing security frameworks for actual paying clients not count?**\"You don't have experience with Palo Alto/Fortinet/SonicWall\"** \\- IT'S A FUCKING FIREWALL. Yes, each vendor has their own special snowflake syntax and GUI, but the concepts are the same. Port 443 is port 443 whether it's pfSense or a $50k Palo Alto. Give me a week with the documentation and I'll be configuring rules like I've been doing it for years.**\"We need someone who knows our exact stack\"** \\- Cool, so you want a unicorn who has experience with your specific combination of ancient VMware, that one obscure monitoring tool you bought in 2015, and whatever cloud mess you've accumulated over the years.The worst part? Half these jobs get reposted every month because *surprise* \\- that perfect candidate doesn't exist or doesn't want to work for your lowball salary.**And another thing** \\- why the fuck don't internships count as \"real experience\"? I spent 3 years doing actual work during internships. Not fetching coffee or making copies - I was troubleshooting servers, implementing security policies, managing infrastructure. But apparently that's \"just internship experience\" and doesn't count toward their magical 5-year requirement.Meanwhile, every goddamn article and report keeps screaming about the **\"cybersecurity skills shortage\"** and **\"millions of unfilled IT positions.\"** You know what would solve that? HIRING THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EAGER TO LEARN AND PROVE THEMSELVES.Instead, companies want to poach already-established professionals from other companies, creating this stupid musical chairs game where everyone just shuffles around for higher salaries while entry-level candidates get locked out entirely. Then they act shocked when there's a \"talent shortage.\"I've had interviews where I walk them through actual projects I've completed, demonstrate my problem-solving skills, show them my homelab setup, and then get rejected because I haven't used their specific brand of the same damn technology I've been working with for years.And don't get me started on cybersecurity roles. \"Entry level position, 5 years experience required.\" The math doesn't fucking math. How am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me to get experience?I know some of you have been in similar situations. How did you break through this stupid cycle? I'm starting to think I should just lie on my resume about having used every vendor's gear and hope they don't quiz me on CLI commands during the interview./rant**TL;DR:** Job market is stupid, vendors need to stop making the same technology with different commands, and HR departments need to learn the difference between \"nice to have\" and \"absolutely required.\"",

I checked both their LinkedIn profiles - the director has worked at 10 companies in 15 years, and the manager 12 companies in 20 years. What kind of stability is that? These are folks who have a lot of employees reporting to them, and we rely on them for direction and culture building. Also, why are companies continually OK hiring people like this? That's what I *really* don't get. You think you're the special company where this new hire is going to stick around, after over a decade of ~1-1.5 year tenures? It just seems like an incredible waste of resources.Everywhere I look on LinkedIn, it's the same. 1-2 year tenures at every company. Hell, that's barely enough time to really learn the ropes and build some impact projects. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these people really don't know what they're doing and their actual job is just \"job hopper.\"Thoughts?",

        "author": "EzekielYeager",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m really terrible at Reddit formatting, so this will probably seem like a blob of text. So many people are incorrectly saying that AI is the driving reason for the mass layoffs, non-hiring, and the downward trend of anything software development related. AI is a _contributing_ factor to the *difficulty* of getting hired at entry level positions at companies, but that’s a standard bar push. But what’s *truly* influencing the mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and shrinking investment into developing proprietary and innovative technologies in America isn’t AI. It’s a tax credit rewrite that was never supposed to take effect. Law and legislation is boring, but this piece specifically, is important for all of you. It impacts your life, your industry, how you’re paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you’re planning to start or work in a startup.I’m going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. The credit I’m talking about:The Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. EDIT: Edits will be for formatting. The law that changed it:The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). This provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. The House of Representatives vote:227 Republicans For13 Republicans Against0 Democrats For192 Democrats AgainstThe Senate vote:51 Republicans For0 Republicans Against0 Democrats For47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against The final result:Signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. Date it took effect:January 1, 2022Why so late?A fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. In short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn’t provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. They assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn’t. Previous:Prior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals’ salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. After 2022:All of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. For domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. For foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. Meaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. Now, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.Which resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. BUT! There is a bipartisan bill that’s going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we’ll see where it goes!",

Me and the two other engineers on our team have tried to explain to this guy that we aren't remotely as good as him, and that he'd have to straight up 3x his estimates for any projects he isn't working on. But to no apparent success. He ends up locking us into utterly insane purely self imposed deadlines that have required enormous late night heroics from everyone to complete. And *everything* to him is an emergency and things MUST happen as estimated because he committed us so completely to the various stakeholders, and them to investors, so now everything becomes a high anxiety house firei've tried explaining this situation to my direct manager, but he's all aboard the train of trying to figure out how to get everyone else at the same velocity as the chosen one. but its just not going to happen.

It definitely boosts efficiency, but at least from my experience, it’s nowhere near replacing engineers.I think companies are laying people off because the tech industry is struggling in general. There are lots of contributing factors, like economic shifts or the new government administration, and I feel like people are overreacting by blaming it all on AI.

Ideally, I think I would like to be at Meta at least until I’ve been E5 for a year or two.Fortunately for me, I have 4 internships under my belt and in my last 3, my managers have all been extremely happy with my performance. In my first internship, I had no idea what I was doing, so I think I underperformed but my manager never explicitly told me that I was underperforming or anything. He never told me I was doing well either.For my second internship, there were a few weeks where I put in 50-60 hour weeks to ship features ahead of conference demos and production timelines. And for my third internship, I was able to create a lot of BS impact. For my fourth internship, I worked on core changes that were actually used at scale (millions only, not billions like Meta).My point is that I think it’s clear that I am willing to put in long hours, I’m able to BS impact, I’ve worked at scale, and I’ve been previously a high-performer elsewhere. I think all of these will be helpful in fast promo and avoiding layoffs.",

        "author": "LeadBamboozler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Sharing this as a heads-up for anyone considering interviewing with CoreWeave, especially for security or infrastructure roles. I went through two interview loops with them, several months apart, and was ghosted once and required multiple follow-ups to not be ghosted a second time — despite confirmed positive feedback from interviewers.**Round 1 (~7 months ago)**I interviewed for a Tech Lead role with a near perfect match in domain, stack, ownership, and experience level. Went through five rounds:- Recruiter- Director- Tech Lead (coding round)- Principal Engineer (system design)- Security Analyst (cross-functional)I moved through the interview cycle and after the cross-functional round, the recruiter emailed me thanking me for taking the time to interview and said he’d collate the feedback and be in touch when he had an update. Ghosted after this email despite repeated follow-ups. I connected with the Director on LinkedIn a month or so after this.**Round 2 (3 weeks ago)**The director shared a Staff Engineer posting that looked to be a direct replacement for the Tech Lead role, so I reached out to him on LinkedIn. He apologized for the earlier ghosting, said I got strong feedback, and that the org had new leadership and shifted direction — fewer managers, more senior ICs. He said he’d love to re-engage and that the recruiter would reach out.The recruiter (same one who ghosted me originally) called me a few days later — but instead of the Staff role, he described an Infrastructure Security role that had similar domain requirements. Maybe I should’ve clarified right then, but I assumed it was all part of the same track and the recruiter mentioned that I would be assessed on the same principles that I was assessed on in the previous interview loop - he explicitly said that he had no concerns at all.They scheduled me with a new distinguished engineer who had joined since the original ghosting. We did not cover a single topic that was discussed in the previous interview.While the discussion was somewhat related to my area, there was a focus on some fairly obscure but oddly specific topics. Despite the curveball - I think I reasoned correctly about the nuances while acknowledging that this area was not something I had direct experience in. The discussion was still highly collaborative and flowed naturally and at the end, the DE mentioned he hoped to speak with me again soon.Then: more silence. Followed up with the recruiter. Nothing. Followed up with the Director on LinkedIn. He said, “let me talk to the recruiter.” A few days later I got a templated rejection email. Zero feedback with an explicit note in the template saying they can’t provide feedback.I understand that goals evolve quickly at high-growth companies. But from a candidate’s perspective, this felt like goalposts were shifting between cycles, and maybe even between rounds. There is a total misalignment in what they’re looking for and across what experience levels. Interestingly - one of the questions I asked DE was *what was the hardest problem he was trying to solve at CoreWeave?*His answer? Hiring and building the team.So if you're thinking of interviewing with CoreWeave: proceed with your eyes open. This process burned a lot of my time, and I walked away with zero signal on where I was off target.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I graduated in May of 2024 with a BSCS. I failed to secure an internship in either the summer after sophomore or junior year. Just before graduating, I had applied to about 35 jobs with no response - not even an asynchronous coding test. It was already clear that I was cooked with no internships. Combining this disappointment with some major health issues, I went the next 7 months after graduation without applying to a single job. I started applying again in January 2025 and over the last 5 months, I've applied to 142 jobs through Linkedin, Indeed and rarely some other sites.In all of these jobs, only about 15 were for software engineering, with all of the rest being lesser tech roles, some even barely tech related: Data Analyst I, Junior Business Analyst, Entry Level QA tester, etc. I've received a total of 6 \"next steps\" including 3 in person interviews and 0 offers. During this time, the only experience I've been able to advertise is my senior year Software Engineering project (year long capstone), an online Business Analysis course, and a handful of menial summer jobs. Grinding Leetcode is pointless - like I said, I've never even been granted the opportunity of a coding interview. Leveraging what few family connections I have has led to little more than \"apply online\" or \"send me your resume\" (the one with no real experience on it).I hear all of these stories that say \"Don't give up! I applied to 500 jobs before I landed my first software engineering job\". Nevermind that there's no chance of me landing an SE job as my first role (no internships), I have yet to get a straight answer as to where people are even seeing 500 relevant tech roles LET ALONE entry level. Both Indeed and Linkedin have slowed to a drip of one semi-relevant entry level job for every 15 that are irrelevant, a scam, or 2-4 years experience crap.So that's where I am. I have no idea what to do at this point, short of applying to Revature and seeing where that takes me (literally). Every day that goes by, I can feel the entry level CS jobs dwindling. God forbid yet another class graduates before I land a job. If anyone has succeeded after a similar situation, please let me know.The current iteration of my resume.https://imgur.com/a/HMpuu7m?s=smsI’ve made some minor PII redactions for the post and I’ve also recently removed the few summer jobs from “Experience” as it didn’t seem to be doing me any favors.

I blanked. Couldn’t find the right words, not even with my mother tongue, got nervous, and the whole thing just spiralled.Then I got rejected. And I accepted this result.What I didn’t know was that some people on that team joked about me afterwards, said my English was bad and my accent was strong. I’ve been in North America for 8 years. It wasn’t even about my tech skills at that point, just that one moment became the whole impression.Fast forward a few months, and I got to know some people from that team through mutual friends. We ended up hanging out, chatting, nothing formal. At some point they realized I had applied before, and their reaction was... weird. They were like “wait, that was you? That new grad with a thick accent?”Guess what, they never even thought I had an accent, not once, until I told them I interviewed with their team before.They literally didn’t connect me with their memory of the interview, because I didn’t fit the version they made up.I’ve moved on now. It took time because, for a while, I really started questioning myself. My language, my background, my worth. All because of one bad moment and some people’s careless comments. But I’m sharing this now because I’ve healed enough to look back without that same sharp pain. Maybe someone out there needs to hear this too.",

From my opinion (with no research yet), I believe AI will make all markets and careers worse as the dependency on computers will grow to save companies money. But then again, if that would happen, would it not get to a point where people are unable to give their money to these companies? **EDIT: Someone notified me I need to be more specific about the year, so let’s say between 2014-2019**",

        "content": "My Background: New Grad SWE (graduated 2025), 1.5 years freelancing, currently 6 months into industry SWE role. Hey everyone, I am looking for advice in my current role. I landed my first software engineering job about 6 months ago after applying to over 750 jobs. The process broke me a bit, but I was so relieved to finally get a foot in the door. This was the only company I made to the final round, so I was going to take it since I was graduating in the next couple months and needed to secure work. It’s a small startup with a team of about 10 engineers. But the environment and expectations are burning me out and I don’t know what to do. Here’s what’s been making this so hard:- Strict micromanagement: My boss tracks and questions every small task. Sometimes asking for 5-6 different changes on the same ticket. When I think something is done, I have to go back and add even more to it, despite it never being asked in the first place. - Zero mentorship or support: I was thrown into the codebase with minimal onboarding and barely any documentation. No code reviews, no senior dev guidance — I’m expected to figure out complex features solo and somehow get everything right. Ive been able to figure things out, but it’s been a very tedious and tiresome process. - Unrealistic expectations: Every ticket is somehow “urgent,” and I always feel behind because the timelines just aren’t realistic. There’s no prioritization since EVERYTHING seems to be high priority. Every month management says they will “replan the month priorities” but they never do and I’m stuck with infinite tickets for the month that just all need to be done. - Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way). I am yet to ask for remote work, but my peer told me not to expect more than 1 day remote, despite the majority of the team having 2-3 days a week remote. By the time I get home, Im exhausted and barely have time to decompress or do things I like before having to sleep to get my 8 hours. Ultimately, I feel trapped. I was grateful to find work after sending 700+ apps, but this constant grind in this environment is really disrupting my mental health. I don’t want to go back to square one and leave this job since I have a lot of financial pressures, but can’t see my self staying here much longer. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to manage this? I feel like 1yoe does not mean anything in this market, but Im not sure how much longer I can continue doing this. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: 6 months into first SWE role, feeling stressed from work environment, expectations, and commute. What should I do?",

Just wrapped up my interview loops after leaving Amazon, and have two offers on the table:* **Affirm: Senior Software Engineer @ Identity Decisioning (180k Salary + 130k RSUs/yr)*** **Atlassian: Principal Software Engineer @ Rovo (240k Salary + 187k RSU/yr + 20% Bonus)**I'm currently stumped. As Blind/Glassdoor indicate that Atlassian is an absolute horror show. Affirm seems like a very chill company & I had a good time interviewing with them. The same goes for Atlassian, as each interview I had was generally chill & the hiring manager I met with was very nice. My gut tells me to take the risk since the comp difference is too much to pass up/this is a potential level up in my career. My main worry is: I've seen various horror stories on Blind & Glassdoor, that make it sound like I'm signing myself for a death march if I end up going with Atlassian. Can anyone who has worked at Atlassian chime in here? I feel like those employed at Atlassian on Blind are very aggressive in telling people to avoid it at all costs, is joining Atlassian a bad career move???What would you all do in my situation? Take Affirm or Atlassian? Previously an L6 at Amazon for 3 years (left due to RTO). So I have some idea of how to navigate a traditional big tech climate.",

How not to loose passion? How to use this energy and potential to maximise returns? Every day in job feels like I am limiting my self. And I don’t want to spend my free time on random hobby.

        "content": "I wanted to share this because I'd usually think someone responding to an automated rejection is a fool and I hesitated for a moment before doing so. I got a rejection from a job that mentioned something about needing to be able to legally work in the country I reside in. I think it's the rejection for needing an H1B visa. Considering that I'm a US citizen working from the US, I decided to reply, despite thinking my email would go into some inbox or maybe the trash, never to be seen. I got laid off over 2 weeks ago so I really need a job, but also this is a job that I am genuinely excited about and would apply there even if I had a job, so I figured what do I have to lose? To my surprise, I got a reply less than 2 hours later saying that there was an error in the filters they set up and my application was rejected by mistake. They got my application back in the queue. I emailed them back thanking them for investigating and letting me know what happened. They replied saying that I also saved 2 other applications from false rejection. While this may not get me a job, it got me on their radar, restored some of my own faith in humanity, and also saved 2 other people from the same hopelessness. I usually wouldn't pay much attention to a rejection email since they're all usually the same, but I guess don't be scared to take a chance and reach out? It most likely won't go anywhere, but sometimes it does. By the way, I'm not saying to reply to actual rejections, but if something doesn't seem to make sense, speak up, these systems aren't perfect.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.Totally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I’ve seen from job seekers who’ve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**Don’t overthink it. You’re not asking for a job. You’re just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person’s position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they’re happy to help.You can say something like, “Hi \\[name\\], I’m currently studying \\[major\\] and exploring career paths in \\[field\\]. If you’d like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I’d love to hear about your experiences.”**2. Build rapport: \\~2 min**Don’t jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:“How are you doing today?”“Hope you’re having a great week, thank you for your time!”It’s a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**Keep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.“I’m currently a Data Analytics student at \\[school\\] and I’m really interested in marketing analytics. I’ve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I’d love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.”Confidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you’ll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.**4. Ask two good questions: \\~10 min**This is where you learn. Try:“What do you like most (and least) about your job?”“How did you get into this field?”“If you graduated today, what would you focus on?”Avoid asking generic questions like “How is your company?” Just try to show curiosity and depth.**5. Follow up consistently**Send a quick thank you note and ask if they’d like to stay in touch. That’s it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.**Tips:**\\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They’re often more responsive than FAANG executives.\\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.So if you’re afraid of networking, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Take the first step and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.Has anyone else networked their way into your first job? How did you succeed?",

I do not have a Bachelor's or even an AA degree (though a decent amount of community college units completed). Right out of the bootcamp I was lucky enough to land an internship at a small government organization via a connection through the bootcamp.I was then converted to full time after the internship. It was a pretty modest junior web developer role that only paid about $50k/yr but the work environment and mentorship were phenomenal. And at least it had some pension and healthcare benefits. Over the last 22 months I've learned a ton and have been given the freedom to make some large and meaningful contributions to the company's flagship products.Sadly we've been hit with some pretty heft budget cutbacks. As the most junior person at the company I'm first on the chopping block and was laid off. As I was being let go, the organization's director offered me a Teaching Assist position at the bootcamp I had graduated. Apparently part of their deal with the bootcamp requires they contribute a certain amount of developer hours towards instruction.She wanted to try something new with a single dev doing the Teaching Assistant thing full time (previously they'd have the more senior devs rotate in every now and then). Currently I work 3 days from home and 2 days in-office. The teaching role would be 4 days a week on-site. I would still be employed by my current organization and keep the title of \"Junior Web Developer\". My compensation would be cut down to $30k/yr AND no benefits.I have a few days to think it over but am tempted to pass on the \"opportunity\". Would that be a mistake? It would be nice to add a third year as a junior developer to my resume along with some teaching experience but I feel like they're really just taking advantage of me.Alternatively I can try to test the waters in this absolutely awful job market. But don't foresee myself getting anywhere. I know tons of people with CS degrees that are having no luck whatsoever. I could also alternatively collect unemployment while working towards an accelerated degree program myself and hope things get better in a year or two.I feel stuck between two kinda terrible options. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!tl;dr Bootcamp grad with no degree but 2 yoe. Currently making $50k/yr with healthcare benefits. Was laid off but offered $30k/yr and no healthcare. Should I take the ~$1900/mo net pay offer just to pad my resume while looking for other jobs? Alternatively I could collect unemployment at $1800/months for 6 months while applying full time and working towards a CS degreeEdit: I spoke to my principal engineer and he was pretty adamant that I do not take that position. He said he couldn’t promise anything but if there was ever an opening for a developer I would be the first person he calls. If I took the teaching job he would be pretty powerless to bring me back on",

I'm aware the job market sucks but I do feel like I'd enjoy it. I like math and computers, and I'm looking for a degree where the skills can be used for creative projects of some kind, outside of work.Because of health issues, I don't have much work experience for someone my age (I was on disability for a long time). I'm mostly recovered now, and thankfully my partner would be able to support us if I decided to go to school full time.But I would be around 37 when I graduate, so that worries me a bit. I know there are a lot of ageism issues, and that things like internships are important. I also worry that since I already lack a strong work history, spending another 4\\~5 years in school will make for a worse situation with regard to that.I don't have any lofty career aspirations, but obviously I would still like to find a job after (or during) school. The other degree I'm most interested in is visual art, which I think has even worse career prospects lol.Basically looking for some guidance on whether it's reasonable to go for CS factoring in my age, sparse resume, the job market, etc. And is the outlook so bad that I should just say F it and go for an art degree instead?? half kidding haha",

One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.However, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.For your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.The technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.And this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.Having stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.Still, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.I think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now. I wonder how you view my situation, and I would appreciate it if you have suggestions for me.",

My project is basically going through every single client of ours, deprecating a mocked instance of my team's product used in integration tests, and replacing it with a proper instance that actually interacts with the intended services. And by god is it hard. Everything I even look at is new. Gradle, dependency injection, internal tools for managing permissions / users, random configuration files, writing production level java code, ohmygawd. I managed (with a lot of help from my mentor) to migrate a simpler testing class, and got an understanding of what it might entail end to end. Then as I skimmed through the rest of the (200+ lol) usages to understand any other patterns - I slowly started feeling sick to my stomach as I realize that I've barely scratched the surface. Sure - if I work my tail off this summer I might be able to finish this thing. But now I'm worried that this is not sustainable, for me. I have a certain... ability(?) to understand *remember* context - and context seems to be everything when you work in a large company / codebase that's been around for a long time - and I think that my baseline ability is not enough to thrive (as opposed to just survive) in such a place. I think I now understand why there's a shortage of truly skilled senior developers - and I'm starting to doubt I'll ever become one. If I'm panicking at every stage of uncertainty and barely staying afloat, I should probably adjust my own expectations (i.e. type of place I wanna work at, expected compensation, etc). I've been told that I should start to become autonomous by mid/late July and I can't ever see myself successfully achieving that. And I'm trying to tell myself that I've barely started and of course the learning curve is high, and things will get better. But I am struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and would appreciate any words of advice :/",

Most of the time it gets to the point where I need to split up the task into super tiny granular prompts and at that point it's just faster for me to do the job myself.Are there people here who work in big codebases that find it helpful aside from writing simple tests and utilities?

I want to get better at just shutting off work brain once I leave the office but it feels impossible. The recent anxiety and frustration I have been feeling because of being stuck in a role I don’t enjoy never goes away and only gets worse.

The reason for this i’m guessing is because of the huge amount of red tape and compliances your software has to have, and the fact that it’s old and works is enough of a reason to not re-vamp the whole thing.The problem is, though, i’m 22. I want to get into development, and while this job offers that, will I get stuck here? My friends are telling me that I am ‘cooked’ but in my mind, even with these old languages, there is still so much practical experience here that can transfer into better development jobs that is much better than just sitting on my ass and getting decline letters for lack of experience. In my mind, this is my experience and even if it’s old, I think that the other skills combined that I will use in this job will make up for everything else.The best things this job offers in my opinion, is their front-end development, and also linux experience. They use a lot of linux, and as of now I am too inexperienced to explain how they use linux, even though I took classes on it in college. I do think that this is great experience though, and hope it is transferrable if I get another opportunity.",

Are there any ways I can improve my chances of getting a team match or speed up the process? How likely is it to get matched within this window?Additionally, I have a few questions:1. I initially gave a salary expectation in the 50th–75th percentile for L4 (based on levels.fyi). Would it help to tell the recruiter I’m open to less, as I care more about the opportunity to grow at AWS than compensation?2. I’ve seen suggestions to regularly follow up with the recruiter. Is weekly follow-up too frequent? Should I reach out by phone or email? Should I inform them if I see newly opened roles that interest me?3. Is there any way to get in touch with hiring managers directly to advocate for myself?Any insights or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

        "content": "In my first SWE job at a big tech company. It seems like every sprint, random stuff pops up that was unaccounted for, and I need to handle that alongside my normal work. Most notably, I own a CI/CD pipeline that breaks at least once a sprint for new reasons each time (usually due to bad changes being pushed through). Individual sprint tasks also tend to have unknowns which expand the amount of time needed. Tasks rarely take as long as expected.My manager doesn't like us adding in buffer time for unknowns, and has pushed back on me doing this before. So I feel like my only option is to take on a load of work that I *know* won't get finished, and deal with the shittiness of finishing each sprint with leftover work to do.Looking at other members of my team, they also carry items, sometimes for a very long time. Is this the norm in the industry? I would much prefer an approach where I can actually get all of my work done and go completely fresh into the next sprint, rather than having a neverending pile of work on my backlog that I know will never get finished.",

        "content": "TL;DR - Inherited a project right before the birth of my child, have been working since. Project has been stalling, and my health is deteriorating taking care of the newborn and project. How can I request paternity leave in this situation?Hi, TIA.I started at my new company late last year, and did a fair/ok job, so I started inheriting teammates assignments (we code).My senior teammate (didn’t get to spend much time with them due to teammate being OOO for a good portion of Q4) left the bank in Q1, and transferred their a project code body and materials to me.It was around their departure time that I let work know I was expecting a baby at the beginning of Q2. Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea. Had I known the complexity of this project, if it was further pushed by management, I would have refused or resigned).Baby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.Issue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but currently I am feeling exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project. I’m currently stuck between not wanting to fail work/losing employment and being there for my family.Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks again.",

Both for consultancy and not. Even though I managed to give them a detailed explanation of things, they kept asking why i didnt pursue certifications.The last few days I have been reading a lot of topics around this subject. And there doesnt seem to be a straightforward answer. Some say experience > certifications. Some say its a red flag if someone has a lot of certifications. And you have people that swear by certifications.Now Im a bit into my doubting phase. Whats true and whats not? In the last two months I have been focussing on certifications, managed to get two, and at the end of this year I hope to get another three. The two were rather easy since i have had experience with them for years. Is this also a red flag? If someone gets a lot of certifications in a year?Because now im doubting myself.What are your experiences on this topic?",

Given that my resume lists December 2025 as my graduation date, I fear that applying to internships will get me auto-rejected.* If I were to apply for new grad instead, then if I do get accepted into a PhD program, I'll have to quit the job after less than a year, which I don't think is a good look. On the bright side, if I don't get accepted into any PhD programs, then I'm all set up with a nice job.I would prefer the internship/co-op route, so I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to apply to internships between undergrad and grad school when you're not even sure if you'll be accepted into grad school, and your resume shows that you're about to finish your degree.Thanks!",
