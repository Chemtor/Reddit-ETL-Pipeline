But 90% of the data quality issues we get paged for are because the business logic changed and no one told us.A product manager wouldn't launch a new feature in an app without defining what quality means for the user. Why do we accept this for data products?We're treated like janitors cleaning up other people's messes instead of engineers building a product. The root cause is a lack of ownership and clear requirements *before* data is produced.Discussion Points:* Am I just jaded, or is this a universal experience?* How have you successfully pushed data quality ownership *upstream* to the product teams that generate the data?* Should Data Engineers start refusing to build pipelines until acceptance criteria for data quality are signed off?Let's vent and share solutions.",

        "content": "I’ve been a data engineer for a few years now and honestly, I’m starting to think work life balance in this field just doesn’t exist.Every company I’ve joined so far has been the same story. Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.Even if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.In my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.I actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.Is this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?",

The previous Data Engineering Manager became a specialist and left the company. It's a bad position, infrastructure has always been an afterthought for everybody here and upper management has the absolute conviction that I don't need to be technical to manage the team. It's been +/- 5 months and, obviously, I am convinced that's just BS. The market in my country is hard right now, so looking for something in my field might be a little difficult. I decided to accept this as a challenge and try to be optimistic. So I'm looking for advice and resources I can consult and maybe even become a full on Data Engineer myself. This company is a Google Partner, so we mostly use GCP. Most used services include BigQuery, Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Cloud Composer, DataForm and Lookerstudio for dashboards.I'm already looking into the Skills Boost data engineer path, but I'm thinking it's all over the place and so generalist.Any help?",

I’ve done an AI-focused internship for a year, and I consider myself intermediate in Python, SQL, and ML.I’m stuck deciding between two paths -- AI/ML sounds exciting but honestly, It feels like I’d constantly have to innovate and keep up with new research, and Idk if I can keep that pace long term.- Data engineering seems more stable and routine because it’s mainly building and maintaining pipelines. I like that it feels more structured day-to-day, but I’d basically be starting from scratch learning it.With just 16 months left and visa rules changing, I’m nervous about making the wrong choice.If you’ve worked in either field, what’s your honest take on this?Based on my profile, i might struggle to land an entry-level ML job cos I only have one year of internship experience. I’d really appreciate your recommendations. I get that ML jobs are limited, so any guidance to navigate this would mean a lot.I’m confident I can put in the work necessary but the thought of my AI/ML internship experience going to waste if I switch to data engineering is scary. I’m not afraid to start fresh, but I want to be smart about it",

The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. Our pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. Everything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. Is this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place? My job is such that I feel even after hours or on weekends im thinking of all the things I have to do. When I log into work these days I feel so groggy.",

It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.The positives of the role are as follows:- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.The negatives are as follows:- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.Due to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.I am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.What should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.What thoughts/advice do people have?

        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m currently doing a Data Engineering internship (been around 3 months), and I’m honestly starting to question whether it’s worth continuing anymore.When I joined, I was super excited to learn real-world stuff — build data pipelines, understand architecture, and get proper mentorship from seniors. But the reality has been quite different.Most of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.For example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.Same with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.I totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.Now I’m wondering:Should I stay another month and try to make the best of it,or resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?Would leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?Has anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?I’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.EditAfter going through everyone’s advice here, I’ve decided not to quit the internship for now. Instead, I’ll focus more on self-learning and building consistency until I find a better opportunity.Honestly, this experience has been a rollercoaster — frustrating at times, but it’s also pushing me to think like a real data engineer. I’ve started enjoying those moments when, after hours of debugging and trial-and-error, I finally fix an issue without any senior’s help. That satisfaction is on another levelThanks",

        "author": "ThqXbs8",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# SamaraI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.The idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.## What My Project DoesYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)- Where the results should go- What to do when things succeed or failSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.## Target Audience**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.## Current State- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)- Full type safety throughout- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress## Looking for ContributorsThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:- Extend Polars engine support- Build out transformation library- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and DatabasesCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)Star it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.---Example: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:```yamlworkflow: id: product-cleanup-pipeline description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data enabled: true jobs: - id: clean-products description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data enabled: true engine_type: spark # Extract product data from CSV file extracts: - id: extract-products extract_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/ method: batch options: delimiter: \",\" header: true inferSchema: false schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns transforms: - id: transform-clean-products upstream_id: extract-products options: {} functions: # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns - function_type: dropDuplicates arguments: columns: [] # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types - function_type: cast arguments: columns: - column_name: price cast_type: double - column_name: stock_quantity cast_type: integer - column_name: is_available cast_type: boolean - column_name: last_updated cast_type: date # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output - function_type: select arguments: columns: - product_id - product_name - category - price - stock_quantity - is_available # Load the cleaned data to output loads: - id: load-clean-products upstream_id: transform-clean-products load_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output method: batch mode: overwrite options: header: true schema_export: \"\" # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle hooks: onStart: [] onFailure: [] onSuccess: [] onFinally: []```",

It's **not production-ready**, just a sandbox for testing and learning.**What it does:*** It has three Python data generators for a realistic mix: 1. **Transactional (CDC):** Simulates MySQL changes streamed via **Debezium** & **Kafka**. 2. **Clickstream:** Sends real-time JSON events to a cloud API. 3. **Ad Spend:** Creates daily batch CSVs (e.g., ad spend).* **Terraform** provisions the entire AWS stack (API Gateway, Kinesis Firehose, S3, Glue, Athena, and Lake Formation with pre-configured user roles).* **dbt** (running on Athena with Iceberg) transforms the data, and **Dagster** (running locally) orchestrates the dbt models.Right now, only the AWS stack is implemented. My main goal is to build this *same* platform in **GCP** and **Azure** to learn and compare them.I hope it's useful for anyone else who wants a full end-to-end sandbox to play with. I'd be honored if you took a look.**GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/adavoudi/multi-cloud-data-platform](https://github.com/adavoudi/multi-cloud-data-platform) Thanks!",

But if im being realistic, this is their way of telling the guy \"you are not suitable or good enough, here is some time for you to leave\"Also, i have tried my best being a good employee. The way that i see is that this company's workload is ridiculously demanding.20 story points per sprints to begin with. And some of the tickets are just too many subtasks for 3 story points. For example setup an etl pipeline complete with cicd deployment for all envs will just cost you a 3 story point.. Besides usually the tickets just have the title, no description whatsoever. Assignee is responsible to find out information about the tickets. And i also got comments on things like i will need to have more accountability on the projects, I mean its just been 6 months.And there are 2 other seniors, both of them are workaholic and they basically set the bar here. they spent time working exactly 12 hours average on daily basis. Additionally, why im saying my team is weird is because i have been doing research and been talking to otber teams. Lets just say only my team have ridiculous story pointings. They shout worklife balance and no need to work extra hours, but how can one finish their task without extras hours if workloads are just too much. Honestly, although i can push myself to be like them, i choose not to. Im already senior level and looking for a place to settle and work as long as i could.Question, will things get better? Should I stay or leave? Manager said stuffs like will support during remaining probation but so far, everything that I suggested just thrown back at me.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.For example, in my setup:PostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial dataMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)DuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasetsFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.However, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.So my question is:**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**Is it mostly about:Maintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data.

I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. 1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). 2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!Thank you!",

All on the starter subscription.Then, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.We are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!Ok, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.We already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.And to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.Is segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification? Is the only viable option self-hosting OSS or creating something yourself at this point?And what are you guys using? I have a few clients who need some good data infrastructure, and rest assured, I will surely never recommend any of them Rudderstack.",

As titled, am I Missing Hidden Costs/Tradeoffs?We're a small shop, 5 data people, <10TB of production data.We used to run our analytics in the production's read replica, but nowadays it always timed out / failed bcz of transaction conflicts.We're storing a snapshot of historical data every day for audit/regulatory purposes (as pg dump and restoring it when we need to do an audit.We're moving our data to a dedicated place. We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.But we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  For the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.With either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshiftWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term. \\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance \\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.I'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it. On Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a queryQuestion:1. Does this storage model make sense?2. Are there hidden compute costs? (from vacuuming/optimization)",

To give you an overview, I want to enable CDC on my tables and consume all the data from a third party(Microsoft Fabric). Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. I’ll give you an example to follow.I have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. Now some changes may appear in this operational table1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example). Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. 4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing Did you encounter similar issues in your development? How did you tackle it?Also, if you have any advices that you want to share related to your experience with CDC, it will be more than welcomed.

I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.My Goal:I want a containerized setup where:1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.My Current Architecture & Problem:I have the following containers working mostly independently:· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.· grafana: Connected to Trino.The missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).This is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.What I've Tried/Researched:· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.My Specific Question:Is the \"Hive Metastore in a container\" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?Any advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!Thanks in advance.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,I’ve been working on a small helper library called **pandas-smartcols** to make pandas column handling less awkward. The idea actually came after watching my brother reorder a DataFrame with more than a thousand columns and realizing the only solution he could find was to write a script to generate the new column list and paste it back in. That felt like something pandas should make easier.The library helps with swapping columns, moving multiple columns before or after others, pushing blocks to the front or end, sorting columns by variance, standard deviation or correlation, and grouping them by dtype or NaN ratio. All helpers are typed, validate column names and work with `inplace=True` or `df.pipe(...)`.Repo: [https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols](https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols)I’d love to know:• Does this overlap with utilities you already use or does it fill a gap? • Are the APIs intuitive (`move_after(df, [\"A\",\"B\"], \"C\")`, `sort_columns(df, by=\"variance\")`)? • Are there features, tests or docs you’d expect before using it? Appreciate any feedback, bug reports or even “this is useless.” Thanks!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.For context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.I use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.Currently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.There is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.My idea: Step 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.Step 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the \"reporting\" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization onlyMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.My points to go for step 2:- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased Anything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",

I read a blog suggesting using storage transfer service, while I know the storage paths of these managed tables in Azure, I don't think copying the delta files will allow recreating them, I tested in my workspace doing that and you can't create an external table on top of a managed table location, even when I copied the table folder. Don't know why though, I'd love to understand (especially when I duplicated that folder). PS, both workspaces are under unity catalog. Ps2: I'm not Databricks expert, so any help is welcome. We need to migrate years of historical data, and also might need to remigrate when new data is added. So incremental unloading is needed as well... I don't know if delta sharing is an option or would be too expensive, since we need just to copy all that history, I read there's cloning too but don't know if that's cross metastore/cloud possible...too much info, if someone migrated or you have ideas, thank you!",

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. Right now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.I guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be? I worked up a dashboard prototype using Chat GPT that I’d love to get some feedback on, if I get any interest on this post. I’d love to hear thoughts from people who work in this field!

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,I am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. There is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.Here’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.The process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:I would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.I would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.I tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.In theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.So here what I am wondering:Has anyone built something similar?Does this approach scale?Are there proven practice for this that I might be missing?So yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. Turns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. I searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. Now, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance \\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector \\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy \\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them \\- Directions for even further optimizations and learningHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search!

Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.I thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.However, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:It’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.Smaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.Larger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.Their suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.That makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.Has anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?How did you position yourself for it?Are there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?And lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?Would love to hear your experiences or advice.Thanks in advance!",

And we've received some new requirements which our system doesn't support, such as time travel.So we need a system that can better manage schema, support time travel.I've looked at Apache Iceberg with Spark Dataframes, which comes really close to a perfect solution, but it seems to only work around the newest schema, unless querying snapshots which don't bring new data. We may have new data that follows an older schema come in, and we'd want to be able to query new data with an old schema.I've seen suggestions that Iceberg supports those cases, as it handles the schema with metadata, but I couldn't find a concrete implementation of the solution. I can provide some code snippets for what I've tried, if it helps.So does Iceberg already support this case, and I'm just missing something? If not, is there an already available solution to this kind of problem?**EDIT:** Forgot to mention that data matching older schemas may still be coming in after the schema evolved",

Our sources are a mix of APIs (some coded in python, others directly in datastage sequence jobs), databases and flat files. We have a ton of transformation logic and also push out data to other systems (including SaaS platforms). We are exploring migrating this environment in to GCP and am feeling a bit lost in terms of the variety of options it seems: Dataproc, Dataflow, Data fusion, cloud composer, etcSome of our projects are highly dependant and need to be scheduled accordingly, so I feel like a product like Composer would be helpful. But then I hear cases of people using Composer to execute Dataflow jobs. What’s the benefit of this vs having composer run the python code directly? Has anyone gone through similar migrations, what worked well, any lessons learned?Thanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "First, I've searched for this topic in other posts, but the ones which would be of more help are years old, and since it involves a fair amount of money, I'd like an up to date point of view.Context:* I need to spend a budget the company I work for separated for training within a month, at most.* I'm currently working on a project that involves DE (I'm working with an experienced Data Engineer), and it would be good to get more knowledge on the field. Also, we're working on AWS.* I'm a Data Analyst with a couple years of experience: this is just to say I have a good base in programming and a general knowledge in the data field.* I already enrollled in Coursera Plus and Udemy Premium for a year using this budget, but I still have some money left to spend.That said, I'm looking for good places on which to spend this money. The cost of Udacity's \"Data Engineering with AWS\" (the 1 year individual course) is virtually the same amount of money I have left to spend. But the thing is, even though it's not my money, I want to make it worth it. Like, I personally think it's very expensive, so I don't want to spend it on something that won't add value to my career. I've read several comments on other posts here saying this nanodegree is sometimes outdated, the mentor's knowledge being very limited to the course's subject etc.So, in case there's someone there who did this course recently, I wish you could share some opinions on it. Other suggestions are also welcome, on the condition they fit the budget of $ 600 - $ 700, but having in mind I speak from Brazil, so in situ suggestions are harder to actually consider. Also, though I'm aiming at DE training because of the immediate context I explained above, suggestions of courses in related fields (like, if you think I should purchase a Machine Learning course) are also welcome. Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Most modern apps and systems rely on Apache Kafka somewhere in the stack, but using it as a real-time backbone across teams and applications remains unnecessarily hard.When we started Aklivity, our goal was to change that. We wanted to make working with real-time data as natural and familiar as working with REST. That led us to build Zilla, a streaming-native gateway that abstracts Kafka behind user-defined, stateless, application-centric APIs, letting developers connect and interact with Kafka clusters securely and efficiently, without dealing with partitions, offsets, or protocol mismatches.Now we’re taking the next step with the Zilla Data Platform — a full-lifecycle management layer for real-time data. It lets teams explore, design, and deploy streaming APIs with built-in governance and observability, turning raw Kafka topics into reusable, self-serve data products.In short, we’re bringing the reliability and discipline of traditional API management to the world of streaming so data streaming can finally sit at the center of modern architectures, not on the sidelines.1.

It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.I've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.If you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**Take as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as \"you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,\" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, \"Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,\" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself \"what was I thinking here?\" then you're not growing.**Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.Lastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking \"okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,\" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.So if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.",

Okay so maybe some clarification is needed: I know the computer doesn't \\_know\\_ (in the sense humans know things) that grey is grey and not chartreuse. I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",

Of course I've been into multiple projects inside this industry, from big e-commerce to management systems, integrations between sites and marketing tools, etc..Recently I had 2 interviews for Senior positions, and I felt very comfortable with the interviews, I passed the 2 live test coding challenges , was I lucky or experience? who knows.I'm going to move to USA next year because my wife is USC, and I'm into this immigration process, but I'm very scared/afraid of interviews in the US, I know that interviews in USA are harder, way harder than here.I've worked with lots of US based customers through my employers, and most of the developers/team mates are very capable , way more than latin american developers, I've worked with Asian guys and their understanding of architecture and computer design is just beyond my skills, and I'm scared that I won't make it in the US because I will be competing against **Asian Developers** that are addict to coding and solving problems for fun.I know that it depends on the company, some companies will have harder interviews , but I feel that my 8 years of experience, will be like 4 years of experience in the US.What do you think? how can I land a job fast ? I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.I'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here. So I'm planning to apply for mid developer positions.Thanks and feel free to comment your recommendations.",

For production itself, I made all the commits through GitHub Desktop and later hosted the project on Cloudflare.Now, I am asking seniors whether I’m doing something wrong or if I should start learning Git commands and switch to the CLI. Currently, I feel that, at the end of the day, GitHub Desktop saves me time and makes everything easier to understand and manage.",

So, I'm wondering: Are there maybe other random algorithms that can work in reverse? That can maybe get seed from values? Does something like this exist?This would allow transferring 100 numbers (or maybe many more?) just by sending a single seed which would be very efficient.I know there are simpler ways to send the data, but this is just an idea I've had.",

We started with Visual Basic (will later start C#) and I never get a functioning code without help. I have no issue reading one and understand how and why it works. But if you put me alone in a room with instructions, I could not for the life of me make it work. Even asking the instructor a bunch of questions doesn't help and he always intentionally phrases tasks a little vaguely (since that's very likely in our future jobs as well). My first attempts are always wrong or my assumptions lead me in the wrong direction. Only after asking others if I can look at their code, do I realize that I have to structure it differently. Is there anything I can do to stop repeating the same mistakes in my approach? Can I even change that? Can I train myself to think differently or is there something I don't know?",

Or have you found a more integrated way to learn?",

A video game in GameMaker Studio, a JavaScript/HTML based NFL Trivia Website, and a Python based NFL Prediction program that uses Pandas to collect data... Although I \"created\" those projects, I gotta admit... They weren't created off the top of the ol' dome. The best way I can explain them is that they were put together with duct tape and bubble gum haha. Whenever I need help with a specific portion, i'd just google the question I had, use code from different forums and tutorials, and edit that code it to fit my specific needs. Like I have no idea how to just free-hand use Pandas for my NFL Algorithm. There is countless hours of googling and taking code to be able to make it happen. I don't know how to just free-hand create an HTML site lol. I just used the code that we learned in a project in school and edited to fit my ideas...I feel like an idiot for that. I guess the best solution is to just keep practicing... but for right now, I just feel like a fraud for not knowing all the intricacies of the languages I use. I am actively looking for entry-level jobs, especially because I have experience in the industy as an Engineering Technician that exposed me to the code that software engineers wrote... But I feel like my first interview (assuming I get that far) is going to be a disaster and i'll get made out to be a fraud...Has anyone else felt this level of Imposter Syndrome?",

Because of that post, this guy u/Raman0902 DM’ed me. He said stuff like “Java will surge” and all that, and honestly, I thought to myself “just another Java fanboy.”But then he shared a YouTube project playlist and told me, “just understand the architecture and try to build the same project in another domain.” So I checked it out… and trust me when I say my mind was blown away.The guy behind that playlist has over **20 years of experience** in Java. Yeah, 20 freaking years! Not like those bhaiyas or didis on YouTube who crack a FANG company, work there for a year, and then start a channel for selling courses. This guy is currently working as a Director, so you can imagine the depth of his knowledge.Now let’s talk about the project itself — The detailing and architecture are absolutely bonkers. The theory videos where he walks through the project’s architecture are barely 5 minutes long. The code explanation videos? Hardly 10 minutes. No BS, no fancy buzzwords, just pure professionalism. You actually feel like he’s giving a clean technical presentation directly to you.The tech stack used: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Kubernetes, Helm, Istio, Auth0, Angular.This isn’t your basic CRUD app tutorial. You’ll actually learn how real, production-grade enterprise applications are built in Java.Trust me you’ll thank me later (thank me for not being selfish enough to keep this project to myself :slightly_smiling_face:), and you’ll definitely thank him too.Here are the links: My Notion Notes: [Bank Project Notes](https://www.notion.so/Bank-Project-29dcead0bac98036a985f65db157cb66?source=copy_link) YouTube Playlist: [Enterprise Java Bank Project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PL4tLXdEa5XIWrhuhgJA1pdh2PDMrV7nMM)If you’re serious about learning and building something enterprise-level, go check this out.",

        "author": "ZealousidealKale2042",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello everyone!Throughout my years of studying programming and work, I have always had the same question. I don't know how to properly find various tools and libraries.While developing projects or doing my work, I tend to use the simplest and most straightforward approaches, relying on old and time-tested techniques that are hard to ignore when learning programming.When faced with a problem or task, I turn to Google for a solution. I usually find one, but it's often not the most efficient or optimal solution. Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.Each time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.But also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).Many of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, \"FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift.\" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?And this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.When I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.I find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.Often, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.And it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.There is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.I understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.In my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.TLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?I am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your help.",

If I have built something similar before, I can rebuild it fast.But the moment I have to design the architecture, data flow, or figure out what talks to what by myself, I just freeze. I do not know where to start, I second-guess every choice, and I end up hacking something together that works but feels messy.What makes it even worse is that if I ask AI to design the structure for the app, it gives me a much cleaner architecture and code layout than I would have ever come up with. Instead of helping, it sometimes demotivates me, because it feels like AI is already better at the part I am trying to learn.So now I am wondering:* Is this normal for early devs?* Does architecture/ code structure come with experience, or do people actually study it as a separate skill?* How do you practice code architecture when you do not even know what a good one looks like?* Is relying on AI for structure a bad habit, or is it just the new normal?I do not use AI to write the full code, only the skeleton, and even that already results in something way cleaner than what I would design myself.How did I bridge this gap?",

Progrmming (Python)2. Signal processing3. Dsp simulation4. acoustic engineering5. psychoacoustics6. Spatial Audio / HRTF7. Coordinates → Audio MappingI studied Python through YouTube lectures, but I didn't fully understand it.I’m currently studying “Think Dsp” and I’m understanding it one by one by following the examples and adding my own comments.I’m trying to somehow get used to Python and the computer language system.I thought, Instead of following an example, why not just write the code from scratch?But I'm afraid it'll take too much time.Impatience comes first.**This is the one thing I really want to know.**How much of the basics should I study before starting a project?Is it better to start a project right away, even if I know nothing?I'm not sure if I'm on the right track right now, so I'm honestly asking for help.I took a year off from university to study on my own.But I had no one to talk to about these thingsEventually, I was trapped in my own world, talking to AI every day.Then I discovered Reddit,and I was genuinely moved seeing how people here give honest, caring advice to complete strangers.That’s what gave me the courage to write this post.And someday, I hope to be someone who can give advice to people who are lost like me.I’m still inexperienced, but I believe your words can change the direction of my life.Thank you, truly, for reading all of this.",

I estimate it would take about a week to get comfortable with the syntax, and 2–4 weeks to gain a solid understanding of the language or framework. The challenge, for me, isn’t learning syntax. It’s actually switching effectively.I’ve tried reading documentation and watching courses, but most resources focus on the basics (how to define a variable, how to write a loop, and other fundamentals). I tried to do project-based learning but I didn't see it much effectiveSo my question is: what’s the most effective way to transition to a new language or framework beyond just learning the syntax?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Context: As part of my self-study routine, alongside reading \\*The Algorithm Design Manual\\* by Skiena, I practice LeetCode problems. I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).I’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.When I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\\* Backtracking\\* Dynamic Programming\\* MemoizationI can also identify the problem category:\\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)I’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best. I’d like to hear about your experiences and any advice that helped you overcome similar difficulties. Thanks!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello. I come seeking advice.I'm attempting to make a game with C and Vulkan (no engine). It will be low scope. It has a low-mid poly aesthetic, fairly involved mechanics, and will be multiplayer, supporting a handful of servers with lobbies with a max pop of \\~16.I'm adequate with C, with a fairly robust knowledge of it's more advanced topics, although I know nothing of networking/multiplayer. Just from cursory research, I hear a lot of nightmare stories of how adding multiplayer could add years of dev time, compounded with using C, it is seen as potentially unfeasable unless you are some kind of savant, which I am not.Now, I did end up getting reasonably far from a first attempt, just implementing the foundations of Vulkan, having an interactable, 3D play area, and moderately advanced game state and mechanic stuffs. Then, my old computer shat the bed, so I am starting from scratch. So, I definitely can at least create the non-multiplayer aspects of the game, but multiplayer is defnitely the big hurdle. I am 100% completely willing to learn this as well.I want to tackle this in a smart way. My plan is to create a single player version first, with all the non-multiplayer related systems in it so that I can at least have a workeable product in case the multiplayer thing doesn't pan out. Yet, the code base will be designed in such a way as to use a simulated pseudo-server, so that I can both at least dip my toes into the water, and when I finally gain a working knowledge of complex networking/multiplayer using C, I can implement it without having to rewrite entire systems from scratch. I'm making this plan without knowing if this is even best practice for this kind of scenario, or workable at all.So, am I being foolish here? Should I bother doing things this way, or should I just jump straight into the deep end and implement networking/multiplayer as I am learning it? Is my plan actually viable, or am I completely misunderstanding just what implementing networking/multiplayer looks like? Is this really such a giant headache with C, at my slightly above average skill level, that I should just not bother at all, and make the game single player?As a short note, I understand that one of the canned responses is to just start with small projects first, but I have never worked this way. I said that I have adequate knowledge of C, but Python was my first language (C is my 4th), and I gained a sufficient mastery over it by doing the complete opposite of that piece of advice. Jumping into the deep end with my grand project of choice is how I learn best. I am just worried if multiplayer would be beyond me by making the development time balloon to the point of making it a non-viable option.",

Keep in mind that preferably we would want a method that isn't blocked behind a paywall, and that we want good habits in terms of organization to form early since we are still teenagers. Also, I'd appreciate it if the UI for the method is easy to understand and intuitive :) Currently, we have a system on Notion (For reference \\`notion.com/templates/notion-projects-and-tasks\\` ) in which we can a list of tasks and each bunch is separated by a \"project\" which is basically a topic like frontend, backend, note taking, etc. This method is cool, as in it's simple to use and we can very easily add on to each section in their own right. However, this method doesn't have much structure, meaning there's just a bunch of task without any organization of what to do in which order, or any \"branching off\" with tasks in the project that are related to each other. Essentially, it's just a pile of tasks. What we want is a roadmap-based system which we branch out into separate categories (UI, Authentication, Communication, etc.) and in each category, we have a linear roadmap which shows each tasks to do in sequence, each task with it's own note or page where we can either add extra mini \"sub-tasks\" to do and comments about our progress and so on and so forth. In such a way where it like creates a pathway of tasks, each task being it's own branch on the tree that connects to others so it gives us a nice flow on what should be done. You know just like standard roadmap but still with great organization, task management and all. At least that's what we invision as being good Having said that, this is what we are sort of thinking of. But we are young and do not know as much as you other smarter people. So I implore honestly, what would be best? Notion, \\*\\*Clickup, Jira, Asana\\*\\* system and software? We know only so much, being young and inexperienced so whatever I am to say a suggestion probably won't mean too much except perhaps that we would like to have a lot of details and good organization.

Stuff along the lines of documenting your project, tracking progress in Jira, using Docker, and adding test cases with Jest. Also, understanding all the fundamentals of development like BigO, DSA, how http is built upon tcp and what tcp, ip, udp actually are, the 9 http methods (as far as I am aware) and what they do, plus whatever core framework / library specific stuff you should know. There is obviously way more to add to the list, but y'know just the more technical side of programming.I'm shooting for full stack development, but have always enjoyed lower level c++ more, but the job market for that seems even more bleak. I am about to graduate college, but just curious how that compares to the alternatives. The more technical stuff may not add up to much, but maybe expresses the enjoyment of learning I guess (which could be an advantage). I am assuming the more standardized tooling experience may add up to something slightly more significant. Idk, I am just kind of lost right now as to how I compare to job market (currently brutal) expectations / other jr developers.I also have several medium sized projects I have worked on, currently developing a fairly large project, and have done a bit of freelance work. So, I am not leaning on technical knowledge as the only crutch, just curious the significance it really has.",

It makes the learning very concrete and tangible. In that way it's a bit easier to \"keep going\" with it as you learn more.But if you're interested in something like how computers work, while it's cool in a mystical sort of sense, or from the perspective of curiosity, it's hard to have a real-world application for it. That lack of real-world application makes it hard to feel like there's goals and a path to follow, and it's easy to feel like you don't have a way to practice what you're learning.I guess put another way, there's some programming/computer concepts that are inherently practical, and some that feel theoretical. How do you find practical applications for the areas that are more theoretical to reinforce what you're learning?",

I know about Powershell, but that seems not so straightforward to learn, plus it's a Windows-only \"language\" (or maybe, set of instructions) which VBS also is, but VBS is \"build off\" VB which is kinda straightforward to learn. I see Java or JavaScript floated, but it seems unclear as of now. This whole thing sucks, but it seems that I'll have to adapt... Thank you.",

I'm a Junior Dev working mainly with Python.I've been asked to write a series of unit tests for a feature that I'm implementing on a project that I've worked on for a couple of months already.To give some context. It's a microservice using a company-developed ORM. Each microservice inherit from a base class with a series of functionalities and the ORM itself. These microservices communicate with each other through a message broker.I need to write tests mainly for business logic and the ORM-related service layer queries. I’ve never written tests before, so I’ve been reading documentation and watching tutorials but most of the material I find is too basic and not fit for what I need.I've managed to write most of the tests for the business logic part, but I find it quite hard to do so for the ORM queries.The main issue I'm facing is understanding how to effectively test ORM queries. Most examples I see online suggest using mocks with predefined return values, but I don’t really see the value in that. If I mock everything, I’m basically faking entire functionalities. So if after adding a new feature or refactoring code were to break, these tests would not detect it. So what am I testing?I feel like I'm testing the same things that I'm writing which doesn't make sense to me.I'd really appreciate some help on this. Thanks in advance! :)",

You have 2 developers in your team, 1 of them is autistic, the other one is naturally gifted and hates retards ( yes the interviewer actually said this word ), the autistic developer has to present his work and the other developer is intentionally asking difficult questions to flex his intellectual.How would you handle this?????? WHAT?Another time I did a system design interview, 2 interviewers asked me a very simple question, how would I do pagination... This was for a very popular payment company.Instead of asking me whether to use cursor-based or off-set pagination or how to implement it all, they asked me \"**why is it called pagination and where did this term originate from?**\"I couldn't answer and they just told me \"**okay, it seems like you're struggling hard, let's just move on to pair programming. Next time please be more prepared.**\"?????LMFAO these morons need to attend a class on how to actually interview people. Ask some real questions that test people's ability to work with others, communicate and solve problems together and not make up bullshit scenarios.",

Honestly, the combination of remote work and alcoholism destroyed my mental health that by the time i received that fateful calendar invite, i was relieved. I didn’t have to do it anymore. I got an okay severance but used that and my unemployment to keep me afloat and not homeless for ~6 months. I quit drinking at that time and interviewed for a few jobs.After two final rounds for a couple jobs and not getting it both times, i’ve basically been frozen. I can’t do the interviews, i can barely even bring myself to apply anymore. I thought it would be easier being sober but it’s like my subconscious is trying to sabotage me because of how truly awful it was in those final months of employment. Here i am, 2 years later, and i’m not even sure if it’s possible for me to get a job anymore when i’ve got a two year gap. I’m borderline homeless, staying with family, and i’m kind of sick of it. Delivering uber eats destroyed my car in this time that i literally just cashed out my old 401k, the absolute last of my savings. I have tried camming as well with my girlfriend, since i’m a gay lady with an unreasonably hot girlfriend despite the life circumstances. It was great money but it’s so mentally exhausting, something i seemingly have no capacity for anymore.I haven’t posted in this sub since 2016/17 when i was a new grad and well, i honestly just want to feel like someone else understands my struggle. I feel like a failure and literally don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I had wanted this career since i was a child. What do you do when your dream job eviscerates your mental health? I know i need therapy but there’s no way a broke ass bitch can just afford that when i can’t even afford rent.I’ll probably delete this or maybe it’ll get moderated for not fitting the sub, but y’all, if anyone reads this, thank you for listening.",

I checked my settings and screen share was set to allow, so I didn’t know what the problem was. I then suggested that I take a moment to download the desktop version of teams but they weren’t having it. 15 minutes or so had passed and one of the guys just said he’d talk to my recruiter to reschedule. This afternoon I got a rejection email. Extremely unprofessional because it’s not my fault teams wasn’t working right, shit happens but apparently they don’t give a shit because there’s probably plenty of other candidates.Just needed to vent because I barely get any interviews because the market is shit so when something like this happens that’s out of my control, it’s pretty infuriating tbh.

        "author": "queenoyster",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "https://imgur.com/a/iRI5FRTI wanted to share my experience interviewing for the past two months in this market. I have a Bachelors of Science in a field unrelated to computer science and graduated in 2020, straight into COVID-world. I'd taken a few computer science courses, so I spent my last semester of university looking for software engineer roles knowing we were probably going to be remote for a while.I've been working for five years, with most of that time at Amazon. I've been a mid-level engineer for roughly 1.5 years, but feel that I should've been promoted sooner. Despite what people say about working at Amazon, I've enjoyed my four years here. I lucked out with finding a good team and manager.My main reasons for leaving are:- Amazon comp philosophy is bad. You are assigned stock to meet a target compensation number, with the assumption that the stock will increase 15% YoY. The stock has actually gained 10% YoY since I've started, which means I'm paid less than my target. The solution to this is Amazon assigns more stock that vests the following years to make up for the gap. This means you'd have to stay longer to meet your target compensation. The reverse is also true. If your actual compensation surpasses your target because of stock gains, then you are assigned fewer/no additional stock vests for the next few years. The employee loses when the stock does well and when the stock does poorly.- Layoffs were coming. The volume of posts about layoffs occurring later this year dramatically increased across Blind, internal Slack, r/amazonemployees, various Discords, etc. Morale was already bad since we did two layoffs prior to 2025.- My work was getting stale.- I felt there was no path to senior for me in the next four years.- I distrust my org's leadership.- I'm in Seattle for Amazon and I've accepted it's not my city. I'd like to move to New York City or San Francisco.Most of the jobs I applied to came from LinkedIn, but I applied manually through the employer's website. I targeted midlevel engineering roles if they were available, otherwise, I applied for senior. Towards the tail end of my job search, I used a browser extension called Simplify to autofill applications. I highly recommend this since you can also use it to keep track of your applications, scrum board style. I spread out my applications so that I would have interviews for the two following weeks.To prepare for my interviews, I bought a year of Leetcode premium and a lifetime subscription to HelloInterview premium. I also joined a Slack server targeted towards engineering leadership career development and participated in mock interviews there. My friends generously offered their time to mock interview me as well. These were great because they gave me very candid feedback. I also searched through Glassdoor for other peoples' interview experiences to get an idea of what to expect for companies I was highly interested in. My weakest round is probably the coding round; I completed 160 Leetcode during this interview cycle and felt that was sufficient. I should note that I would've practiced more Leetcode if I were interviewing with large tech companies like Google or Microsoft, but I didn't hear back from them. I also had never done a system design interview before this job application cycle, so I studied that hard. I read every HelloInterview system design article and felt I overprepared.Managing emotions around rejection was pretty difficult, I'm thankful I have good friends I could talk to. I got rejected from my top 3 target companies and I bedrotted for weeks beating myself up over it. If I were to have done anything different, I would've front-loaded my interviews with companies I cared less about. I felt much more comfortable in my later interviews. I also would've spaced out my interviews more. It was difficult balancing them and a full-time job. I tried to do early morning interviews (I even had two 2AM ones!), but found that my performance really suffered in the morning. I'd block out time in the afternoon instead to do interviews and pray no one at work wanted to schedule over them. I'd often work after hours to catch up on work I'd neglected during the day.I ended this interview cycle with 5 offers: 2 senior and 3 mid-level. Two of these offers were at late stage SF-based AI startups (not any of the big names). I accepted one of these. I don't want to reveal exact numbers, but I'll say that my base comp exceeds my total comp at Amazon, and I am extremely happy with it.",

        "content": "I normally don’t post about my personal issues online but I genuinely feel lost on what to do right now. I was laid off in the last week of 2024 and have been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for the past 10 months. I have 5 years of experience at a FAANG company and consider myself good at selling myself because I consistently make it to final interview rounds, but I’ve not landed a single offer all year. Now it’s November and I just got the ‘no offer’ emails after final rounds with two more companies (I think I have failed 12 final loops now). What do I do now? I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies - I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything - I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviewsAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciatedEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying. I don’t normally post on social media but getting to discuss this anonymously with others has been very helpful. As many have pointed out, my interview skills are not perfect, and I when I get feedback it’s generally about the system design round. While I can easily create a high level design and have used Hello Interview to practice, I still slip up when asked for low level details about components I haven’t worked with.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m about six months into my first full-time software engineering job at Apple, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.I also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.For example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.I also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.Lately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.What really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.Has anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind? Is this normal? Are there courses, books, or resources that helped you connect the dots and understand the bigger picture of how software systems work in practice?Any advice would mean a lot.",

        "content": "So for some context, I would not consider myself old school by any means. I started learning to code with Java back in 2017, so I learned to code \"the old-fashioned way\" by looking at documentation and/or stack overflow before AI came into the mainstream.I now work in test automation primarily using C#, but I also have quite a bit of experience with Python as well. I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like \"My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now.\" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.When you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you? In my experience it seems to be good at things like leetcode, but bad in large codebases with dependencies and structure.Edit: From these responses it seems like most of you use AI basically the same way I do, with the exception of the cursor comments. Unfortunately I’m in a corporation so switching to cursor and trying it out isn’t really feasible for me in this context. Maybe I’ll give it a try on my own and see how it does for a side project.",

It might sound easy due to not coding, but i need to stretch my brain in a way that just gets me very overwhelmed, while also being incredibly BORED.I just never imagined that, I would be coding less, while being 5x more stressed than ever. A lot of the requirement documents I review are poorly written, so I have to keep scheduling meetings / following up with ppl to ask questions.. my day sometimes is just meetings ALL day, with almost no time to eat a damn meal. And then I need time to do code review so my team members' aren't blocked! So oftentimes, I do the code review at like 7pm after dinner or early in the morning the next day. Shit's fucked.

I never felt I was more than mediocre, and then I got sick with nebulous undiagnosable long covid, which made my performance worse, and I became an easy budget cut. After a few months of inactive burnout (where I lost a lot of muscle memory), and a few months of sending out CVs, I had pretty much given up on getting any significant interviews any time soon and was pretty much just messing around with ones I didn't care about and building my portfolio as much as possible, with an aim of just learning out loud and then leveraging that in my next round of applying. I was making a language learning app with some NLP elements in python for the last couple months. I haven't written much Java since April, and even then, my last position was fullstack and they had me on a lot of frontend in the final year. I haven't done any leetcode since June (and most DSA I haven't revisited since I got hired at my last place >2 years ago). Studying up on the systems design I'm starting to be expected to understand better as a now potential mid was in my backlog.Suddenly, two days ago I got an email from a big tech company (not FAANG but close, and in an adjacent field to my last company) I had applied to a month or more ago. I remember filling in the application form thinking \"I don't know why I am doing this, I should definitely wait until I have improved myself and have an actual chance. They're going to think this application is pathetic\". I expected no response and honestly forgot entirely about the job position or what I even wrote in that form. They want to interview me for a Java position.I can only assume they saw how my last company is actually vaguely relevant to their product and clicked on my github and saw how active I am rn and actually wanted to give me a chance.I have accepted, have HR on Tuesday, I'm just trying to work out how to get myself in gear in time for the next stage if it happens. Currently revisiting all of DSA on leetcode and doing problems but I'm unsure I can manage to internalise this stuff in time... Plus there are other elements like SD that I need to look over.How would you strategise going about this? Have any of you been in a similar situation and given it your best shot? Lmk",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm an ML Engineer with 6 YoE and a PhD for ML in Applied Math, based in the US. I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to \"unlimited\" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.For the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.Just for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of \"R&D\" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.But whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had \"unlimited\" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.Everyone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.Any advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad. Beyond that, if anyone has experience with this I'd like to hear about it so I can understand what to do / not to do.",

        "author": "PentaSector",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all. Apologies for the long post. Mainly want to be thorough to emphasize the efforts I've made and the scope of the problem.So, I manage a small squad of devs on a larger project team and maintain a full-time dev workload alongside them. (I know what you're thinking, and you're right, but I've accepted the challenge for the sake of my trajectory.)This is my first managerial role; I was deliberately given less advanced devs, partly to mentor them and help boost their professional development, partly to shield them from aggressive technical leadership. I was fine with that assignment; it plays to my strengths as a mentor and safe space steward. I do what I can to foster collaboration and self-organization - we have* a chat channel just for my reports and me (i.e., a space to screen \"stupid\" questions before asking the wider team, etc.)* regular meetings to check up on work status and collaborate on blockers in real time* 1:1 and 1:few meetings to get people comfortable and talking through obstacles* me frequently working to communicate thought process to the team through detailed code reviews, driving on pair/group programming sessions, and brainstorming out loud during aforementioned meetingsBasically, I'm doing everything I can to not only get people working together, but also to make sure they see the work through my eyes as much as I can verbalize my process.I'm confident in asserting that I'm putting forth disproportionate effort in getting them somewhere closer to my level. My efficiency suffers for it, but leadership is generally happy with my velocity, and I'm still significantly more efficient than the rest of the team. Some of them are legitimately junior and gradually ramping up, but a few have more YoE than I do and frequently submit incomplete, incorrect, or arguably badly engineered solutions (acknowledging that the latter is somewhat subject to my opinions, but it's also the least of my worries). This manifests in incredibly frustrating ways, like having to talk through the same technical guidance or arguments repeatedly as people continue to make the exact same mistakes, and having to frequently repeat what strikes me as obvious advice to solve refactoring or bugfixing problems (e.g., if you're trying to correlate a code path to a navigation path within a web app, start with a known related unit of code and follow the references). Tl;dr: lack of curiosity seems to be a major factor.These are the kinds of problems that resulted in me being stepped up to manage these devs, and the lack of improvement is felt across the wider team. This manifests pretty clearly in the fact that we estimate our own roadmap and have decent leeway to do so, and the devs aren't even meeting their own numbers when they get the padding they argue for. We're essentially not at liberty to stretch our roadmap much further, just given the dependencies on our output, so when we fall behind on our own estimates, it's a problem, and people come under scrutiny.I was recently asked to pull the tech lead into one of our regular meetings - one where mob coding is a frequent engagement - to help gauge the situation. After sitting in on a few rounds, his assessment was that I'm doing enough of the work that they ultimately have no need to be curious when I drive, and he's right. Anytime the devs pull me aside, it turns into me taking the cockpit and talking through how I work; I always let them start, but I usually take over *because* they essentially hit a point where they're just lost or out of ideas, including in the context of obstacles we've specifically worked through before.His proposed solution was to start letting them fail immediately. There's a version of this that I can get on with, but this work environment is not particularly tolerant of the kind of \"failure\" it would entail, and I don't want to put anybody's job at risk.So my question is essentially this:**What's a graduated approach I can take to get people working more independently that gives willing devs a chance and respects my time?**I don't foresee something like purposely tracking my collab hours and tuning them down each week; that'll never hold up. I *have* contemplated cutting all collab hours and letting code review be our only touchpoint. The problem here is that several devs don't seem to internalize review feedback, and PR churn sometimes results in exponential loss of time. E.g., they may submit a PR after one day but take two more to fix relatively simple issues. I'm essentially looking for a way to provide detailed, immediate feedback that they *will* internalize, while keeping my time burden for that sort of effort stable and eventually decreasing.Moreover, **what's a way to do this that doesn't leave people feeling demoralized or traumatized?** I'm clearly frustrated, but these are still people, and I don't want to make their lives hard. I just want to see them perform to their potential.Open to any insights regarding successful approaches that folks have taken here to empower and motivate their teams, especially if starting from a place of subpar performance.Also feel free to ask clarifying questions or hurl clarifying insults; there's surely a lot of context I'm leaving out here, probably in part just because I'm fixating on solving the problem more than thinking broadly around it.**EDIT:** remove a rogue instance of the word \"I'm.\"",

        "content": "Hey Everyone, Up until August I had only ever worked for one company in my professional career. I grew with them from a support agent, to an integration consultant, and eventually became the team lead of their integration consulting team. However this year there were some changes that rubbed me the wrong way and I took that as a push to go find something new, and ultimately joined a different company as a technical consultant. Now, 3 months into my new job, I've just learned our team is being offshored and I'll be out of a job at the end of the month. And unfortunately for me there is no longer a great abundance of integration consultant jobs like there was a couple of months ago, and most team lead roles want some amount of development experience. I'm facing the prospect of either changing careers or waiting on the sidelines for much longer than I'd like. Where do I go from here? I have a two-year diploma from a technical college in Canada and the 5.5 years of experience listed above. I don't have any coding experience in a professional setting. Outside of staying in consulting, or moving back to support (which could require a big paycut from what I was making), what other CS careers could my experience translate to?",

That is, join when the company is laying off people as the “price” is less (less competition because of people who are scared of joining because they’ve heard of the layoff news)The whole premise of this question depends on the idea that people are more hesitant to apply to and join a company that has recently laid off. Do you think this is true?Have you seen companies that have gone through massive layoffs actually become a good place to angle for work?",

Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. Side note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles.",

It honestly feels like a hackathon.I’m trying to understand the system logic and learn SnapLogic at the same time. I’m making progress, but I’m frustrated. Yesterday I found a bug and figured out the root cause and fix in minutes — but then spent the entire day figuring out how to implement it in SnapLogic. Tried docs, AI tools, trial-and-error… nothing. Finally got help from a SnapLogic dev in another team and he solved it in 15 minutes.On top of that, this feels like a career-direction issue too. My manager is changing soon, which means I’ll likely be stuck owning this SnapLogic project long-term. Once it goes to production it’ll mostly just be maintenance and I don’t want to get pigeonholed into this. I want to stay focused on backend Java projects, not get boxed into ETL work I’m not excited about.How do you handle situations where you get assigned to a project you’re really not interested in and don’t want to end up tied to long-term?

        "content": "I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.&nbsp;For context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.&nbsp;To be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).&nbsp;> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.&nbsp;> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.&nbsp;>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.&nbsp;There were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.&nbsp;I did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.&nbsp;It just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

From my understanding, before the bloodbath, if you have some of the things in the posting the companies would take you as you are and you could learn the rest on the job.

For those further along in their careers, what factors helped you choose your path? How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?

Working as software engineer for a defense contractor and been here 3 years. For the people in a similar company you will know it is semi laid back as things are allowed to move slow but the work can be challenging at times.Heres my dilemma.. I feel like I should be somewhere else making way more money. I think my talent is going to waste here working on 30 year old C++ code. Multiple coworkers have told me not to stay too long or you will have no option in the future. Feeling a bit down. The pro about the job is that it is very secure, almost recession proof. It’s just that it’s starting to feel like im not doing the best I can in my career. I’m about to be 27 and I feel like it’s now or never. Really want to work as an engineer for hedge fund or something to do with trading and quantitative stuff. My company will pay for my masters but that means staying there another 3-4 years. Am I just tired of the repetitiveness? Lately I’ve been thinking it would be the same anywhere I go. I find myself as somebody who wants to get better everyday but this new stage in life seems like I reached a pinnacle. Anybody ever feel the same way? I see people here grinding for jobs and complaining they can’t get one so maybe I’m just ungrateful. TL;DR feeling like I’m not doing enough despite having a decent job. Looking for something to change in my career but also feel that this is as good as it can get. Anybody been a similar situation? Any words of encouragement or advice?",

I’m pursuing Senior SWE position(s). Through my recruiter screening and technical phone parts, I believe I’ve shown that I’m technically strong, and I think they know through my introductions that I haven’t mentored or led projects. That’s why I’m curious about what expectations I should anticipate when speaking with the hiring manager.This market is tough, so I’m taking all the help I can get. I’m self-aware that socializing isn’t my strongest skill. In past hiring processes for SWE II roles, I tended to succeed at companies that emphasized LeetCode-style technical assessments. But at places where the behavioral portion carried weight, I often fell short—partly because I optimized only for the technical side.Now I’m focused on building strong behavioral stories. I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.Overall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager. I’m willing to invest significant time into this preparation since acing the behavioral round feels like a fixed cost in today’s market",

Maybe it’s just me but I feel like as soon as I receive feedback from a peer that’s somewhat negative, it means that I’ll have to wait again till next year to try again for a promotion. Does anyone feel this way as well? I’m stuck in a mid level role and I’m not sure if I’m even capable of being a senior engineer because of this.",

Some worked for \"famous\" companies, even got some with titles shouldn't apply to our job.My team has been trying to hire people since a few months ago. We first were looking for candidates who know the tech stack. We got bunch of resumes from the consulting companies that mentioned they have worked on the tech stack, and they all have at least 7+ years of experience ( in general), but literally none of them passed our two round interview. The first one is questions about some basic knowledge ( basic if you've worked on the tech stack, in my opinion ), and questions about how the candidates would solve a problem.The second round is a coding challenge while sharing the screen (like pair programming where we might give some hints) that only takes about 90 mins. The features we asked them to do are really basic if they have worked on the tech stack before, and we also allowed them to google and check the documentation if they want, it really is an open book exam, but just no AI stuff. 90 mins is really more than enough to complete.None of them passed. We decided to look for candidates who know a different tech stack that I think is more well known compared to the first one, but also to focus on how they solve problems, like the approach they take, how they are solving it, and etc. Guess what, literally only 2 of them passed and they aren't really the devs we are looking for, we only hired them because we realized they know a tech stack well enough and seems to be alright when it comes to learning new things.We have interviewed more than 40 people already.

Hiring freeze, no promotions, no roadmaps, and no opportunities for internal transfers since all open positions are now based in India. The general sentiment is that there’s little interest in the products my org develops and that we're considered too expensive, so our situation isn’t looking good. While the budget for next year is already allocated, there’s a real risk of layoffs starting in 2026.I’ve started exploring new opportunities, for fully remote roles. I mostly find openings at startups. European big tech have largely stopped offering full remote positions and are basically in hiring freeze, so the available roles are few and highly competitive. That said, I’m able to compete for positions at established startups, typically Series B or later, since I avoid earlier-stage ones due to the higher risk.My dilemma is this: should I stay where I am, stagnant and without growth prospects, but hoping the rumors turn out to be wrong and my division gets a second chance? And in the meantime, maybe hope for a lucky break with an interview at another big tech? startup? Does it make sense to leave a big tech for the risk of being without work in two years for a startup that I imagine could fail anyway in the same timeframe?",

But a few months back, someone told me that to be “job applicable” or to get some of my project to good level, I \\*need\\* backend skills too. Personally, I hate web dev I might get hate for saying this, but backend feels more logical and fun to me.Most of my batchmates use Spring Boot (Java) or Dj/Flask/Rest (Python). I didn’t want to pick Java or JS, so I started learning Go last week. So far it doesn’t seem too hard, but I’ve heard that goroutines and Gin get tricky later on.So, my question is: Should I focus on Python (faster prototyping, slower execution), or Go (backend-focused, is fast and unique, but harder to master as a developer language)? Would love to hear some insights!!(if I'm breaking feel free to take this down)",

So, I don't really care if a HM or whatever doesn't like what they see. That being said, would it be bad in this day and age to just have a repo with many large, quick commits that indicate the obvious use of an AI tool?
