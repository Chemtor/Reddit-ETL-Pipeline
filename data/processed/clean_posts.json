        "content": "I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:- Application scalability, availability, and security.- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. I've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *\"Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.\"*However, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.Data lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?Even simple stuff like \"what is a 'feature'?\" took some time to wrap my head around. *\"Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?\"*Anyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering. When they wander into your lane and start stepping on your toes, try not to get too upset.",

We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.And two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.To make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. We are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance. Would like not having to spin up a full lakehouse or manage Flink.Any thoughts or insights that can help us get out of this mess?EDIT - Fixed typo.",

Even better if you can get some analyst experience and have data engineering experience. This will get you a seat at the table with more important business stakeholders.I had a lot of hope that I would develop this type of domain knowledge, but I ended up just being assigned data platform work or data ingestion work where domain knowledge is almost not required Even after asking to be moved to positions that provide this kind of experience, I am not provided with those opportunities.",

It's designed for a mobile gaming use case to calculate leaderboard analytics.The architecture is broken down cleanly:* **Data Generation:** A Python script simulates game events, making it easy to test the pipeline.* **Metrics Processing:** Kafka and Flink work together to create a powerful, scalable stream processing engine for crunching the numbers in real-time.* **Visualization:** A simple and effective dashboard built with Python and Streamlit to display the analytics.This is a practical example of how these technologies fit together to solve a real-world problem. The repository has everything you need to run it yourself.Find the project on GitHub: https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/tree/main/projects/mobile-game-top-k-analyticsAnd if you want an easy way to spin up the necessary infrastructure (Kafka, Flink, etc.) on your local machine, check out our Factor House Local project: https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-localFeedback, questions, and contributions are very welcome!",

I’m a Junior Data Engineer (\\~3 years in, including internship), and I’ve hit a point where I feel I need to **level up my technical foundation**, but I’m struggling with self-discipline and consistency when learning on my own.# My background:* Comfortable with Python (ETLs) and basic SQL (creating tables, selecting stuff, left/inner joins)* Daily use of Airflow (just template-based usage, not deep customization)* I work with batch pipelines, APIs, Data Lake, and Iceberg tables* I’ve *never worked with*: streaming, dbt, CI/CD, production-ready data modeling, advanced orchestration, or real data architecture* I’m more of a “copy & adapt” (from other prod projects) engineer than one who builds from scratch — I want to change that# My problem:I **don’t struggle with motivation**, but I do with **discipline**. When I try to study with MOOCs or read books alone, I drop off quickly. So I’m considering **enrolling in a postgrad certificate or structured course**, even if it’s not the most elite one — just to have *external pressure* and deadlines. I care about building real skill, not networking or titles.# What I’m looking for:* A **practical learning path**, preferably with hands-on projects and real tech* Structure that helps me stay accountable* Deepening my skills in: Airflow (advanced), PySpark/Spark, Kafka, SQL, cloud-based pipelines, testing, CI/CD* Willing to invest time and money if it helps me build solid skills# Questions:* Has anyone here gone through something similar — what helped you push through the discipline barrier?* Any recommendations for **serious technical courses** (e.g. Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, ProjectPro, Coursera, others)?* Are structured certs or postgrad programs worth it for people like me who need external accountability?* Would a “nanodegree” (e.g. Udacity) be overkill or the right fit?Any thoughts are welcome. Honesty is appreciated — I just want to get better and build a real career.Is it really just \"get your sh\\*t together and create a personal project\". Is it that easy for most of you guys? Do you think it's lack of something on my end? EDIT: M24",

The pipelines I build are fairly small and nothing too heavy.I’ve been given a project that’s actually very important for the business, but the standard here is still batch files and task scheduler. That’s how I’ve been told to run things. It works, but only just. The CPU on the VM is starting to brick it, but you know, that will only matter as soon as it breaks..I use Linux at home and I’m comfortable in the terminal. Not an expert of course but keen to take on a challenge. I want to containerise my work with Docker so I can keep things clean and consistent. It would also let me apply proper practices like versioning and CI/CD.If I want to use Docker properly, it really needs to be running on a Linux environment. But I know that asking for anything outside Windows will probably get some pushback, we’re on prem so I doubt they’ll approve a cloud environment. I get the vibe that running code is a bit of mythical concept to the rest of the team, so explaining dockers pros and cons will be a challenge. So is it worth trying to make the case for a Linux VM? Or do I just work around the setup I’ve got and carry on with patchy solutions? What’s the general vibe on docker/linux at other companies, it seems pretty mainstream right?I’m obviously quite new to DE, but I want to do things properly. Open to positive and negative comments, let me know if I’m being a dipshit lol",

        "content": "I built whats in the subject. Spent two years on it so it's not just a vibe coded thing. It's like an AI jackhammer for unstructured data. You can load data from PDFs, transcripts, spreadsheets, databases, integrations, etc., and pull structured tables directly from it. The output is always a table you can use downstream. You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.The workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets. There is a RAG agent as well, I have a vectordb attached.In the gui on the left is the table and on the right, there’s a chat interface. Behind the scenes, it analyzes the table you’re looking at, figures out what kinds of Python/SQL operations could apply, and suggests them. You pick one, it builds the code, runs it, and shows you the result. (Still working on getting the python/SQL thing in the GUI, getting close)Would anyone here use something like this??? The goal is let you publish the workflows to business people so they can use it themselves without dealing with prompts.Anyhow, I am really interested in what the community thinks about something like this. I'd prefer not to state what the website is etc here, just DM me if you want to play with it. Still rough on the edges.",

It took what I went through, and still going through, for me to post this.****So, Chris Garzon..., Lets talk about him a moment. This is a guy who couldn't give a sh!t about his students/clients. Unless, of course, they pay him a crazy amount of money. And, I found recently, he isnt as good as he says he is. There is so much I want to say here but it may incriminate some folks so I must digress. Just know, Chris is not a good person. He has a great face for his commercials and has a good mop of hair. On top of that, he uses some good taglines in his commercials. At first, his commercials targeted noobs like me. He made it seem like this was easy and they were here to help. What a crock of shit.****I started learning SQL (which I found out was free). If you have a question about something you are learning, you are asked to place the question in a slack channel that is provided to you. The question sits there until someone gets around to it which is usually the next day. A lot of the time the CSM (Client Success Manager) would tell you to \"check chatgpt\" or \"Look it up on youtube\". What? Isnt that what I paid OVER $10K for? For you to assist me? Sorry to inconvenience your day. Its hard for anyone studying to come across a question or logic that is hard to understand and just need a quick answer.** **Calls for study would happen but the instructor didnt show a few times. They have been better about that. DEA even created a discord channel and right when people were using it, they took it away. At first they were all about \"Study Buddies\". Find yourself a partner and study with them. Great, so you do that and use the discord but then they take it away. Back to square 1. Studying on my own with no one to ask questions or anything. I felt lost.** **Then, a number of months go by and we see a new add from Chris. He was marketing different. \"You must make between $150k-$200k and have a couple years of experience OR KEEP SCROLLING\" was the new tagline. Everyone was up in arms. Some guy on the site made a post about it. He called Chris out and everything. He was pretty respectful too. I wouldn't have been. To think they scammed the new comers, me. To think that the job security they talked about is now gone and out the window. What pieces of crap!****Then... Python starts and the instructor is insufferable. The course is horrible. Not much else to say about that other than I paid over $10k to change my career and become a data engineer and I have to go buy another course because the one I was ripped off for is absolutely terrible.** **Now, not everything is bad. There have been some good teachers and mindset coaches. Payal was amazing and she got tired of the place and quit.** **It would be in your best interest to look elsewhere for your education as a data engineer, even if you are experienced. Dont fall for the commercials.****#whatdidigetmyselfinto** **Me...**",

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.I am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3. If I choose s3, can I store the data in s3 tables instead of csv or parquet and what would be the advantage of it?",

        "content": "Hey everyone!We just released an open-source Airflow provider that solves a problem we've all faced - getting reliable alerts when DAGs fail or don't run on schedule. Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.With just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (\"did the nightly job run?\") and execution health (\"did it finish within 4 hours?\"). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings: from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout... dag = DAG(\"nightly_dag\", ...) # Enable tracking with one line! enable_telomere_tracking(dag)It integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.Check out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.Would love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",

The GitHub Actions extension feels clunky and not intuitive.Our goal is to find a setup that is:Developer-friendly (ideally integrated in VS Code or at least easy to trigger without manual clicking),Not overly complex (we considered building a Streamlit UI with buttons, but that’s more effort than we can afford right now),Seamless for deploying Power BI models and reports (models go via Fabric CLI, reports via deployment pipelines).I know most companies just use Azure DevOps for this — and honestly, it works great. But moving to GitHub was a business decision, so we have to make it work.Has anyone here implemented something similar using GitHub successfully?Any tips on tools, IDEs, Git integrations, or CLI-based workflows that made your life easier?Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Just like it says - I need reasons for not using Talend!For background, I just got hired into a new place, and my manager was initially hired for the role I'm filling. When he was in my place he decided to use Talend with Redshift. He's quite proud of this, and wants every pipeline to use Talend.My fellow engineers have found workarounds that minimize our exposure to it, and are basically using it for orchestration only, so the boss is happy.We finally have a new use case, which will be, as far as I can tell, the first streaming pipeline we'll have. I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”. (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).Of course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing. I'm fine with using it to shift from S3 to Redshift to keep him happy, but would appreciate some examples of why not to use Talend streaming over MSK.Thank you in advance r/dataengineering community!",

The team also handles some downstream work, but it's less common and likely to go away.

        "author": "Adrien0623",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey!I recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.In my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.Here’s a high-level overview of the current setup:- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).While this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.To address this, I’m considering the following changes:- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.Given the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?Thanks a lot!",

You can speed it up further with parallelism. \\- Sling costs 3x more hardware resources for the same work compared to any of the dlt fast backends, which i found surprising given that there's not much work happening, SQL copy is mostly a data throughput problem.All said, while I believe choosing dlt is a no-brainer for pythonic data teams (why have tool sprawl with something slower in a different tech), I appreciated the simplicity of setting up sling and some of their different approaches.",

The manual classification process was becoming unsustainable: slow, inconsistent, and impossible to scale.Instead of spinning up Python-based NLP pipelines or fine-tuning models, we tried something surprisingly simple: **Snowflake Cortex's** `CLASSIFY_TEXT()` function directly in SQL.A simple example: SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT( 'Delivery was fast but support was unhelpful', ['Product', 'Customer Service', 'Delivery', 'UX'] ) AS category; We took it a step further and plugged this into a scheduled task to automatically label incoming feedback every week. Now the pipeline runs itself, and sentiment and category labels get applied without any manual touchpoints.It’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s consistent, fast, and gets us 90% of the way with near-zero overhead.If you're working with survey data, CSAT responses, or other customer feedback streams, this might be worth exploring.

Is it common for engineers to not write the initial business logic themselves?2. How do you gather and translate business requirements in your teams?3. How well do you actually know your source tables and data models in day-to-day work?4. Does your process feel bureaucratic, or does it genuinely help produce better outcomes?I’d love to hear how other teams approach this and how involved engineers typically are in shaping the actual logic before production.",

Assets can be populated using the CLI, API or Terraform* Interactive lineage graphsIf you want to check it out, I have a really easy quick start that with docker-compose which will pre-populate with some test assets: git clone https://github.com/marmotdata/marmot cd marmot/examples/quickstart docker compose up # once started, you can access the Marmot UI on localhost:8080!

I currently have a dictionary object that I just set some first level data in. I save this dictionary object several times as a file up in a bucket. This tracks information about the process such asa. did i log into the API successfullyb. how much data is availablec. how much data did i download successfullyd. did the api report any license changes when queried.This is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. I then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room. I dont save the metrics in another datasource.However i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs. And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. I am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database. I have GCP so i can use pub sub, I also have access to a simple postgresdb to publish to. I do like that my stack is simple (json file to bucket) but i also know that I am not getting information that I want.Thoughts on how I could improve on this? I dont mind adding something to the stack to support it. Adding something like Sentry would be my last choice at the moment as I am trying to keep the reporting stack closer in house. I am mostly looking for nice incremental improvements I can make that aren't re-stacking everything.A few other notes\\- These are cronjobs running in a linux box\\- No airflow, airbyte, dagster in the stack at the moment",

My original plan was to use an AWS Lambda and configure Event Source Mapping to automatically invoke the Lambda when new events are written to the Kinesis stream. However, I've started wondering if this will cause performance issues as this could end up creating 120+ connections (1 invocation per shard, I have 30+ streams which each have 4 shards) to Postgres. One option could be to use RDS Proxy or PgBouncer. However, I think the \"easier\" solution could be to just write a continuously running script that creates a psycopg ConnectionPool and just run this in ECS as a service.How would you solve this?

        "content": "Hey folks,I've been working on [`rustframe`](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe), a small educational crate that provides straightforward implementations of common dataframe, matrix, mathematical, and statistical operations. The goal is to offer a clean, approachable API with high test coverage - ideal for quick numeric experiments or learning, rather than competing with heavyweights like `polars` or `ndarray`.The README includes quick-start examples for basic utilities, and there's a growing collection of demos showcasing broader functionality - including some simple ML models. Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.Right now, I'm focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality. I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.### What's inside:* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing### Known limitations:* Not memory-efficient (yet)* Feature set is evolving### Links:* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)* Docs:  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)  or  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)I'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!Thanks!",

Just validation in your browser.# Why it matters:I designed the UI and contract format to be **clear and readable by anyone** — not just engineers. That means someone from your team (even the “Excel-as-a-database” crowd) can write a valid contract in a single video call, while your data engineers focus on more important work than hunting schema bugs.This lets you:* Move validation responsibilities earlier in the process* Collaborate with non-tech teammates* Keep pipelines clean and predictable# Tech bits:* Python lib: data-sitter (Pydantic-based)* TypeScript lib: WASM runtime* Contracts are compatible with JSON Schema* Open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/lcandea/data-sitter)# Coming soon:* Auto-generate contracts from real files (infer types, rules, descriptions)* Export to Zod, AVRO, JSON Schema* Cloud API for validation as a service* “Validation buffer” system for real-time integrations with external data providers",

I wasn’t expecting big changes because they were busy with coursework and exam prep and didn’t have much time to practice between sessions. To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.This experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials. I used to think problem-solving was different that you had to grind endlessly to “figure it out.” In college, I spent countless hours on Codeforces (eventually reaching ~1900 rating and I remember feeling soo excited) and told others, including my brother to just practice more. Looking back, I wish I had given better advice not just solely focusing on practicing a lot of questions but thinking and improving the approach we take for solving any problem",

I spent so long trying to figure out which things I could edit without globally editing other components. Some of the local/global style sheets I couldn't figure out where they were applicable to other components until further digging. And then there was the issue of the UI library itself and it's own self-imposed CSS rules. I wrote what felt like the most ridiculously specific selectors just update some simple component UI because otherwise, nothing worked. Honestly, if I could've just coded it in bare HTML/CSS/JS, it probably would've taken 30 minutes at max. Instead, it took me half a day. Am I just really slow?",

However, he is still pretty young and doesn't have a computer yet. I am looking for gift ideas that will encourage and tap into that \"coding desire\" but aren't necessarily \"learning to code\" yet. These can be games, books or anything of the sort, maybe even android apps but it would be nicer if it was something physical. So far the only thing i've really thought of is redstone books / guides so he can do some minecraft logic. However, I would prefer something more physical. These don't need to be directly coding related but anything that will stimulate that tinkerer, programmer, problem solving mind. Bonus if it is coding related but I'd settle for something that scratches the programming itch. I know of scratch, but as he doesn't have a computer, I think ill save that one for a little later when he does.edit: Whoa, this blew up fast. Thanks everyone for your answers, there are some great suggestions.. including just getting him a computer (which I agree - but I have to convince his mum on that one first!). I am going to go through everything suggested and see if there's some we can do together and some for him to do on his own. Haven't decided on anything yet but there are some wonderful suggestions, might be coming back to this list for his birthday next year too!",

        "content": "Hey folks,I'm currently learning web development, and I’ve been trying to escape this thing everyone calls \"tutorial hell.\" Instead of just following along with videos, my strategy has been something like this:1. I find a project with source code (usually from GitHub or a course).2. I go through the code and figure out which parts I don’t understand.3. I take crash courses or quick tutorials on those missing concepts.4. Then I try to rebuild the project from scratch on my own.I’ve seen a lot of people here say that building your own stuff is the key, and I totally get that. But as a beginner, building something *completely* on my own still feels a bit overwhelming. So this method has been kind of a middle ground for me. I’m currently thinking to work on 3–4 projects using this approach.Just wondering — does this sound like a good learning path? Has anyone else tried something similar or got any tips to improve it?Would love to hear your thoughts!",

I’m honestly lost on where to start.I've taken time off and I can dedicate 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, to learning until December to- as they say- \"figure my life out\" and \"get my shit together.\" I need a clear, up-to-date path that won’t lead me to dead ends.

My last couple of review cycles have been positive overall but have highlighted some areas that I feel like are quite big weaknesses for me and that I am not sure how to improve at.It took me a very long time to get to the level of being a steady junior contributor who can be given a task and reasonably trusted to implement it with some guidance and instruction from more senior engineers (partially slow adjustment period on my part, partially poor management during COVID) but I really feel like I've hit a plateau and don't know how to get out of it. The main feedback I'm getting is that I need to do more code reviews and speak up more in meetings to discuss design - my work is fine in and of itself (though I feel my ability to design things and push my projects forward is a bit lacking) but I have very little impact on the wider team. I feel like I don't know how to analyse code or review it at all, that I have no deep understanding or knowledge. I can execute tasks well but really struggle a lot with designing solutions to problems or critiquing designs to suggest improvements or point out potential holes. When I try to review code I can spot simple mistakes, but amn't able to give anything more indepth (pointing out areas of refactoring, inefficiencies, suggesting alternative ways of solving the problem) and don't know where to start. When I start looking at reviews I can just feel my mind go blank instead of being able to break down the review and think through what's going on with it or what could be done better.Because I've been working in this career for quite some time I feel bad even asking for help, I've managed to struggle my way through it so far but it's very stressful and I don't want to feel so incompetent and afraid when doing my job.

Once I’ve written my Python code, what do I do with it? I understand that code is written instructions for the computer to perform specific actions — but once I run that code in, say, PyCharm, and that code checks out. What comes next? Do I copy and paste that code into specific software to make an application? Where do I put this code next to do anything meaningful? It seems useless in PyCharm. I want to “action” it. I’ve watched a ton of YouTube videos and can run regression analysis and do basic strings/variables that provide info within PyCharm. But if I wanted to program a simple rock, paper, scissors game into a website, then what do I do with the code? Is this where mobile application software and website design software come in? Do I paste this code into this type of software to actually “create the game”? And not just have it spit out random variables (Rock, paper, or scissors) in PyCharm? My current knowledge (which is probably wrong) is that:1. You download a programming language2. You write the code3. You run it within a developer environment (PyCharm for example)4. Once tested in PyCharm — you run that code in another software that will “bring it to life”Step 4 has me co dosed as hell. Rip this apart and teach me please :folded_hands: I come to this thread extremely desperate and humbled.",

My main question is really about relevancy. Do these books still hold up today? Or are there better more recent books that I can read? In addition if anyone has any advice on learning it’d be very well appreciated. Thank you for your time",

        "author": "tree332",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. I had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.In linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor. I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems, but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \\*any\\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation. In discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me. In intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.I ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.I have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school. I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year, but I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS degree curriculum on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.When I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. when I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as \"how to draw a 2d triangle program\" opens up a new journey learning the opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.I have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. I then go back to an \"intro to java/python/c# course\" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.I'm not quite sure how to move forward.",

I don't have a job in programming, only have 1 major project under my belt, and I still have a lot to learn.Now for my advice that I wished I knew when I started out: code by discipline, not by inspiration.What do I mean by this? Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.Anyways, that's my advice. What do you guys think of it? I hope this helps someone out starting coding!",

Eventually, I turned it into a short book.A few ideas it covers:* How to evolve a system without turning it into spaghetti* Safer ways to deserialize and construct your data* Turning input validation into something the compiler helps with* Where generics shine — and where they secretly hurt you* Treating time/space complexity as part of the interface contract* Making failure obvious and early instead of quiet and delayedIt’s all freely available — just a public repo on GitHub.If that sounds interesting, I’d be genuinely happy to hear what you think.",

I've recently been intrigued by computer vision right now but again, all of this confuses me what should i really study to land me something fruitful.I am just really confused what field I should be choosing for future. Can anyone guide me? Also, I flagged this debugging because I want to debug my life (its supposed to be a good joke :p)",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm currently in university and have only learned the *very basics* of C and some other things related to programing and Software Engineering. I got into an internship (called FTT) where I was placed in a project as a backend developer — but there wasn’t much onboarding or guidance.The project is a WhatsApp chatbot (not AI-based, just a menu tree of questions and answers to help students with common doubts about our university). The second part is a dashboard for professors to interact with “tickets” — messages from students that the bot couldn’t handle.At first, I was excited and learned a lot. I got exposed to things like databases, HTTP requests, backend frameworks, APIs… way more than I ever saw in class. But now I’m stuck. I don’t know what the next step is. I’m just staring at the codebase and feeling completely lost.To make things worse, the “client” (university professors) barely show up to clarify things. We don’t know what API to use for WhatsApp integration, and we’re not even sure if we’ll get access to a real number to test the bot properly.We had about a month of vacation, and during that time, I started learning Java. It felt cool — I like how structured it is. But despite that, I still feel like I don’t know how to code. I feel like I’m just copying code, Googling everything, and faking my way through things. I don’t feel like a “real” dev. Sometimes I feel like a fraud.I know this is all part of learning, but it’s hard not to feel lost or like I’m falling behind.Has anyone else been through something like this? Any advice on how to push through this kind of block?",

Dependency injection. This is as straightforward as it gets. If a manager needs access to a resource, just pass it into the constructor.2. Service location. This is a pattern whereby managers, after initialization, are registered into a centralized registry as pointers to themselves. If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.Here's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location?

One of the main reasons is that my salary hasn't kept pace with industry standards, which has made me feel undervalued in my role.Over time, I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also tried to use my own knowledge and experience to improve my skills. Unfortunately, as one of the remote workers in the company, they are mobbing me to leave. As a result, my team pushing me to do tasks like meetings, ci/cd deployments and documentation. Limiting my work but I still do the coding stuff because Im the one who is pushing for it and I dont get any support from my team. It started be like this since last 2 years. First 2 years were great and I learned a lot in those times.I've found it tough to balance my work and personal life because of work times and getting tired from sitting for 8-10 hours. These has made it hard for me to find time to learn new things outside of work. I have applied for jobs but I've often struggled with basic development trivia questions because I haven't been keeping up as much as I'd like or memorizing about everything about the technology I used.In one of the applications that did showcase my skills was the one I created a microservice from stratch. But after the project interview they wanted me to write some basic code(reverse the string they provided). It took me a bit longer than expected to get it done because I wasnt going to write code in the interview from what they told, my laptop was in a way to show my face which didnt had room for me to write but I managed to write it with some debugging. It wasnt enough for them I think they just declined my application. I applied to here through a senior friend and they thought how did he create all of this by himself, must have got helped which I didnt get any.Anyway, now I'm feeling a bit stuck and unsure about how to move forward. Despite knowing a lot about project structures and API design, backend development etc... I'm not feeling like my skills are growing as quickly as I'd like. Im doing some leetcode, hackerrank examples and studying some topics (taking notes) but yet Its not enough or match the criteria for the applications. Sometimes I feel like I cant write code without looking to documentation or examples. And sometimes I cant write it out of my head, I know what to create or write as an idea but the functions or annotations are not in my memory all the time, I have to look for the usage.I'm wondering how can I make some changes or seek out new opportunities to learn and grow. Im really tired of this loop, feeling like exhausted but need a job for living. I keep learning, taking notes etc but Im still here without moving forward",

The problem is I can only focus on one task at a time. These tasks usually require deep focus, making it impossible to effectively switch between them.For example, I have a couple of pet projects, and when I return to either of them to make some changes, it always feels like starting from scratch - learning the codebase again, figuring out the code logic. Every time. Another example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time. I'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them? Maybe it's a silly question, but I'm genuinely curious how other people stay productive in these situations.",

To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.I need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \\~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.Unless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed. Is the the standard approach to just immediately serve images and accept the low levels of risk as a tradeoff for very fast UIs, or is there a better approach that I am unaware of?",

I pick one thing I don't know to implement. for example I'm making a online shop with React + Tailwind + Django. I have never worked with Django, and before this project to get a glimpse of it I made an API for a calculator app. it could store username + password and users calculation history.the problem is I don't feel like I'm learning good. like I am learning concepts like models, serializers, JWT token, restAPI, some of reacts design patters like useEffect, context etc, but I dont read documentation. I use AI to explain them for me.when I don't know something I tell chatGPT something like :how do I get users username from api. then it gives me the code and I ask about how every line works. and the next time I'm making something similar I try to do it myselfto day I was making the user cart system. with my own knowledge I was able to make components and stuff but when I hit a bug or a error I asked chat gpt.im wondering is it bad ? cause I hear a lot in YouTube and stuff that Ai does not produce good code and its often not safeI really like to know your opinion . thank you!",

Because I realized I suck at coding so much and I’m struggling to improve.At first, I thought it was time investment ; I thought I simply wasn’t coding enough. Then I thought I just didnt know the syntax. Now, I’ve realized that u will most likely never know all the built in functions or the syntax, but u still should be able to code and solve problems. My biggest issue is this: I dont think I ever approached compsci in a correct way. I just thought if I solve enough questions, if I just see enough codes from the past, I’d be able to get past it like I did with other subjects in high school but it’s not true. The more I try to become better, the more I realize the biggest issue is: I really don’t know how to break down big problems into smaller ones, know how to specify what kind of functions/ datatypes I will use, and solve the problem. I’ve just been learning the syntax, never deeply dove down to the core of the problem, and relying on ai when there are parts I dont know how to fix. And to make things worse, I really dont know how to practice these things. The more I look at what I’m doing, I’m realizing more that I have really shaky foundations in computer science, and I’m scared because I know in a couple weeks, I’d just have assignments and exams flooding, possibly without fixing the core issues I need to fix. I really dont want to continue ‘barely passing’ all my subjects over and over and end up graduating as a C/D tier software engineer who can easily be replaced. I would really appreciate help. Books, any type of online practice for this kind of thinking. I’m often overwhelmed even by leetcode style questions where there are multiple things i need to do for one program, and it’s like I start panicking completely and I dont know what to do or how to even approach the problem. When things get complicated, I simply don’t know where to begin with.I seriously feel so useless because I just recently found out I was focusing on the wrong thing the past two years. I can’t afford to give up now either. I NEED TO MAKE THIS WORK. Please help me :folded_hands:",

However, we have never written unit tests for the Java code. Was thinking to write unit tests on the Java methods that help support the Gherkin Syntax to catch any issues with our Gherkin integration tests, such as false positives, , ensure the syntax is working as intended, etc., but is that a good practice?Maybe I am overthinking it. I guess we can write unit tests for anything if we want to, but also not sure if we are writing tests for tests in this case, which I think might be a bad practice. It's more of tests for the Java code that allows QA to write the integration tests. I have only seen unit tests for a service's or library's functionality, but not for the tests in a way so was having some doubts.",

I just realized this means my API keys are completely exposed for anyone to see in the \"View Page Source,\" which is a huge security risk.I need to fix this for my existing tools and also learn how to build my new tools correctly from the start. But honestly, I have zero experience building a \"proper\" backend with something like Node.js or PHP from scratch.So, my main question is: **For a beginner on a WordPress site, what's the simplest way to handle this securely?**1. **Can I do this inside WordPress itself?** Like, is it a good idea to use a PHP snippet in my theme's `functions.php` file to create a simple, secure endpoint? Or is there a trusted plugin for this?2. I've also heard about **\"serverless\"** tools like Cloudflare Workers or Netlify Functions. Are those a good fit for a beginner? Can they even work with an existing WordPress site just for these specific tasks?3. If you have any **links to guides or tutorials** for someone in my exact situation, that would be amazing.Any pointers you can give would be a massive help. Thanks so much for reading!",

But lately I have been struggling with the question of what and how should I persue ahead in cybersecurity.

But my peers have been focusing on DSA and building a good CodeForces rating and participating in competitive coding to get a good placement at the end of of college. I tried doing this but haven't been able to stay on track. I know that knowledge of data structures and algorithms is necessary and needed in cybersec too but I feel like I should focus more on ctf and knowing tools and doing something practical and learn things as I go. But I fear I might be wrong and the way I think might not be the way to go. I need experienced advice on how should I proceed ahead. I am interested in lot of things right now like low-level programming and how operating systems and native application work, web development and exploitation, and networking related stuff and even some quantitative finance as it requires low-level knowledge too. I completed OverTheWire Bandit and hackthissite.org's basic level and found it really interesting and fun. I have heard of TryHackMe and HackTheBox too. What should I do and how do I go on ahead? May be my question is stupid or irrelevant to this subreddit but I need some direction and experienced guidance right now to lead me in the right direction.3",

A job will clearly state \"no sponsorship\" yet an Army of overseas people will apply anyways.If you're a mid level engineer, or even entry level, a large reason why your resume isn't even seen is because a job posting will have 1000s of literal garbage resumes to sort through. People who probably have a higher chance of winning the Powerball than getting a job offer.You can be a great candidate for the job but have 3000 piles of shit stacked on top of your resume that make it impossible for you to be seen.

        "author": "FredWeitendorf",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)Let me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may \"know\" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.Number one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?Number two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.Third most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they \"get it\"? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.None of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.Here are a few common examples:* Sending very flowery, \"fake personalized\", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to \"stand out\" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.*** Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**What these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**(cont. below: what to do instead)",

On top of that, the May and June numbers were revised. 19,000 jobs were added in May and 14,000 jobs were added in June.

        "content": "Hi, my partner wanted to do a career switch from social working to programming and started studying basically mostly full time around 2 years ago. We live in south of Italy which makes already hard to find some positions, I feel she's doing it at the extra difficulty level.These are the thing she knows:* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Angular* Java* Git, bootstrap, tailwind, postman, docker, payload CMS, Figma* Mobile design, responsive design* VSCode, EclipseShe did find some jobs that were paid very very little, like around 600 euro for months (while an average salary is more than 1200 euro).The first one had a very toxic boss and I advised her to leave that because she was going insane, the guy was really toxic. The second one they had to let her go because they did some bad calculation around the budget they had and fired a couple of new people and she was one of them.She is getting really depressed with this despite being her dream, and I think she's not so bad that she can't find a job, there are really bad people out there, how can she not find one after all this energy and struggle. It makes me really sad to see her in this situation and would love to help her in any way possible.Since I use reddit regularly I wanted to ask people in this subreddit what we can do?We have optimized CV in every possible way, she did a portfolio, she's trying to find clients in the meanwhile. But a part from that, what can we realistically do? How can it be so hard after all the efforts?",

        "content": "I’ve been a frontend dev for 6 years at a big university/hospital system. Got into the field through a bootcamp after a liberal arts BA. It’s the only proper job offer I’ve ever received. I came in at the minimum, making a bit over $50k. I was happy to finally have a job.The job is stable. Demands are more than reasonable. But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, \"why should we?\" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.I’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?Maybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.I had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of \"I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me.\" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.Maybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.I don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore? If I was, or could be, what would that even look like?",

For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.During my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.Lately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.Here's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I'll be looking into doing a Master's program and getting internships that way. I'll also try to monetize my app and leverage my skills to see if I can start turn it into a business.",

I’m not sure what his endgame is, probably just to ladder climb. I’m usually not a competitive person and normally wouldn’t care, but his patronism is annoying, especially when about things I understand much better than him, and there are already clues that he’ll try taking credit for my accomplishments.

        "author": "SomeRandomCSGuy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. I am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. As a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. I realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).There is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.A lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. For these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. The documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.I worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. Don’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. So I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. If you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. Looking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!Happy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",

I'm just good at learning and perfecting. I enjoy making processes efficient and error free. Investigating missing inventory is probably my favorite thing to do. Tracking and finding out who, where and why there's a discrepancy in the inventory count. I also have picked up roles along the way such as parts sales, service coordination, small machine repair (technician quit, they asked if I knew how to repair, said I'll try. Now I'm the small machine repair guy). I dont feel like I'm being compensated for any of the extra roles I fill.fill.This job is very stable. No reason to believe I'll ever be let go. Not a volatile market but slow to progress pay and I don't like doing most of it. Would I be committing career suicide to chase a career in tech? I only have a high-school diploma.

        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"In the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.For the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.Throughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.Fast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. At 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.No full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"Honestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.Truthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\" today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. Side note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.Is it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?I just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

Have about 150k saved up apart from 401k and IRA which also ends up being about 80-100k.I am currently okay with my job, pretty comfortable and enjoy it but current team changes and stuff have got me rethinking for a new team or a job. Anyways I have been interviewing and searching rigorously and will probably try to upgrade my job to possibly big tech hopefully in the upcoming year.I want to move out of my parents house and move to a big city where my work has offices- NYC, Chicago, SF, DC being my options in order of preference. My TC will be about 145-150k. I am a pretty active guy who barely drinks and not materialistic at all. Been feeling that the number in my bank is just a number and don’t feel happy with my current situation. Do you think this is a wise decision? I want to explore and find my community and friends.I feel stuck living with parents not that I don’t have my freedom but I feel living alone would solve that mental problem. Sometimes I do wish I want to leave my cushy job, travel the world with my money saved up for 6mo to a year. On the way I want to pursue my hobbies like learning instruments, a new language, getting into really good shape, surfing or diving, and also try to start a business or find a remote tech job and be a digital nomad.What advice would you give me given my current situation?EDIT: Traveling solo 6mo-1yr has been a bucket list goal of mine. Should have made that clear before. I want to do it and no matter how cheesy it sounds it’s something I dreamt about 10 years ago and still think about everyday. I do want a family and kids where I don’t have worry about money but that’s like PART 2 of what I want from life. PART1 has been being a SWE and living in NYC and traveling the world for a year ish. Hopefully that makes sense. It’s wishful thinking but yeah.Something that keeps my mind at ease with not worrying about money is: Happiness is relative!",

My second manager made an 8 point per sprint requirement and said I didn’t have to do it, then it became a performance issue when I didn’t do it. Very confused. Now the thing is I “ask too many questions” and am not technically independent. I’m tired. I do all my stories. I never caused carry over or even a defect. I always take notes after asking a question so I never ask the same question twice. I have multiple certs. Was in a hackathon. If I’m struggling so much, how am I completing all my work before the deadline? When I ask a question, I always say what I tried first. I never ask without trying and saying what I tried because that’s annoying. I don’t communicate well with my tech lead because he always gets irritated very quickly towards me. Use to laugh and snap at me when I code constantly. Didn’t want to deal with that so I route questions elsewhere.Had multiple managers and they’re just like “oh if you just do x (replace x with study outside of work, try before asking a question, say what you tried before asking a question), then they’ll be nicer to you”. Like….ok….havent I been doing that for a year straight?And apparently performance reviews aren’t based on actual goals, but vibes. No one has given me goals yet. I don’t pass my tech leads vibe check so all feedback from him is negative. I don’t know what they want from me. How do I even improve at this point? I study outside of work, I use ai, like…do I just suck at my job? Do I suck at this field? I don’t get it. Went to hr, they said “sounds like you’re just complaining that you have to do your work.” I can get another job, but is that best? Is this a team specific problem?

I have been in software development for years at consulting companies where clients ask to develop certain systems for their needs which are mostly CRUD with complex business rules, rarely realtime. Most of those solutions do not need large scale system design, you may use containers, may be K8s if you are lucky. But mostly do not need hundreds of microservices, CQRS, event-driven stuff. Even if we have freedom of tech stack we are doing disservice to client and future developers if you did something complicated for resume driven development. While I can try and learn new design patterns, good coding practices, there is no room to build things at scale.But when you look at jobs posts, they ask for things like microservices, event-driven design, CQRS, Kafka etc. So my question to those who were in similar situation before, **how to gain experience building things at scale when your work do not need things at scale?** It seems I have been stagnant years without opportunity to involve in systems that need scale.",

I have mostly front end responsibilities and asked to have firefox and chrome put on my machine. The IT agency that runs things REFUSES, giving security as a reason. \"Edge only\". In fact, they want me to install any and all software engineering related programs on a virtual machine which has a very slow frame rate and builds up servers incredibly slowly. I'm going crazy. The CTO said he chatted with the head of this agency and agreed that things should be put on the virtual machines, which was really disappointing. Is using firefox and chrome etc. on a virtual machine that much safer than using them on my own machine? How does that work?Jobs, as we all know, are hard to come by, and many of us have families to support, so advice like \"just leave\" aren't the most helpful. I'm wondering what I can say to both my bosses and this awful IT agency to give me ammo against their arguments.",

I have a dream of doing a CS PhD (probably in Europe) for Type Theory/Programming Language Theory, but I did Math in undergrad so all my letters of rec would have to come from the Masters. Is an online Masters program a death knell for my dream of doing a CS PhD or is there any precedent of getting into a PhD from OMSCS or getting letters of rec from an online program? I'm very passionate about theoretical CS but am kinda regretting the Math bachelors right now ;-;",

We use a lot of SaltStack and most of my day-to-day is writing custom Python modules to set up small amounts of server infrastructure by executing those custom modules with SaltStack. More recently we’ve been using Ansible as well, but to me none of this seems like real software engineering work and I’m afraid of being pigeon holed into Platform engineering when I prefer more traditional SWE.My question is: how do I properly transition from a more platform oriented role to more SWE oriented? Is that really a thing?

Then he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away \"it should be quick\". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work. I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work.

Honestly, I’m a bit confused and unsure what to believe. I’ve talked to people about this and have received mixed results.

On the other hand, I have family members that work in IT that believe that programming jobs as we know it are basically over.I’m also planning to double major in CS and Applied Math. I’m hoping that the math degree could give me some flexibility and open up other career options in case the CS job market remains difficult, what are your guys thoughts on that?Am I overthinking this?

        "content": "When I was a teenager, I developed an interest in programming. I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.Should I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes? What does your career path look like?",

I feel like looking for alternative career options.Anyone who shares my thoughts - What are your next plans? How do you stay motivated?",

I want to break into high frequency trading as a SWE and had a roadmap set in my mind for how I would reach my goal in 2 - 3 years time. I wanted to have people's opinion on how realistic this is. Currently as part of my placement year (more like semester), I'm interning at IBM. I'm working on Db2 which is IBM's enterprise database solution. If I get a return offer, hopefully, this is what I'll continue working on. Now, I know to break into HFT, I'll need a lot of experience in C++ and I was hoping this opportunity would give me that. I have considered applying to HFT firms but I feel like I won't be able to make it past their interviews since I'm not prepared much in that area and also am quite inexperienced in C++. As Db2 is a database, I'm also getting experience in low latency/high transaction systems, solving concurrency problems. I feel like these are all skills HFT firms value. I understand I'll be lacking in the area of financial knowledge. After 2 years of working here, I hope to get a Master's done with a minor in Finance, after which I plan on applying to HFTs. Would you say this plan is realistic or are there some changes you would suggest? Thanks as always :)",

I want to one day work with AI, not sure in what way but probably more in the engineering way rather than the science/math part of it. I’m looking at job listings in my area and a lot of them want one or the other (or even both sometimes), and I’m wondering which I should prioritize learning in my free time. I personally don’t want to just pick up something without a goal or purpose… this field is too huge for that",

        "content": "Background (skip further down if you don't care):I'm a SENG with 3+ years working on a product that was acquired by Trimble in 2023. Nobody knew we were getting acquired besides our CEO at the time. When they told us our new salaries I'm not sure what they were based on since the lead (who actually knows what I do) wasn't involved at all. I wasn't exactly happy with my new salary compared to my coworkers so I spoke with my manager (formerly the lead) and told him I'll take on more work/responsibility so I can get a promotion down the line. So I bust my ass for 1.5 years and finally he tells me he's submitting a request that I'm promoted with the higher ups. Fast forward *8 months*, nothing. Two performance reviews during this time and my manager doesn't really know what's going on, no updates from anyone. So I'm frustrated, burnt out, unmotivated, and feel taken advantage of.My question (skip here):In my search for a new job I have an opportunity at Stripe. Stripe pays twice what I'm paid at Trimble but the internet tells me the wlb and culture there sucks, like Amazon bad. Now I'm fine with occasionally working late but it can't be every day and I can put up with annoying coworkers if I can just focus on my work and don't deal with them much. In contrast I love my coworkers where I currently am, we're all buddies. The culture at our office is amazing, but the work itself isn't always great as I'm constantly helping other teams. So is the pay at Stripe really worth it? Do I just take the leap and see how it goes? I don't want to be miserable at my job but I also want to get paid what I know I'm worth.",

        "content": "I'm a new grad SWE working at a F500 company. I'm lucky enough to be on a team of young, hungry engineers/data scientists building a cool internal product with a modern stack. From what I understand in my capacity as a junior, my colleagues are strong engineers who have a great, rounded skill set and are capable of building robust code quickly. I have a lot to learn from them and I've already picked up more than I ever did in college. With that being said, they're also fairly young. I barely know what I'm doing, and while I trust their technical skills, this seems to be their first time in a mentorship position. They've expressed to me that they're always open to advice, but I, the mentee, am not sure I trust myself to give that feedback. My question is this: What does good mentorship look like? How can I guide my mentors towards helping me develop a useful set of skills? And how will I know if we're on the right track?",
