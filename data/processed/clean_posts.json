        "content": "I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:- Application scalability, availability, and security.- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. I've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *\"Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.\"*However, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.Data lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?Even simple stuff like \"what is a 'feature'?\" took some time to wrap my head around. *\"Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?\"*Anyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering. When they wander into your lane and start stepping on your toes, try not to get too upset.",

That table has not been updated for the past 2 weeks. We sent wrong invoices to our non-USD customers. Morale of the story: Never ever rely on people upstream of you to make sure everything is running/working/current: implement a data ops service - something as simple as checking if a critical table like that is current.I don't know how this situation with our customers will be resolved.

Now I've become curious as to it's usecases and found a few confusing comparison, which lead me to two different questions still unanswered:1. Is DuckDB really a database? I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. 2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS.",

I have zero clue of what to do or where to start. My SQL skills would be somewhere between beginner and intermediate. How should I go about setting the data quality checks and data transformation? Is there any particular resource that I could refer to, because I think I might have seen the DBT core tutorial on the DBT website a while back but I see only DBT cloud tutorials now.

        "content": "I am working on a real-time pipeline for a logistics client where we ingest millions of IoT events per hour from our vehicle fleet. Things like GPST, engine status, temperature, etc. We’re currently pushing this data through Kafka using Kafka Connect + Debezium to land it in Snowflake.It got us far but now we are starting to see trouble as data scales.One. We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.And two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.To make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. We are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance. Would like not having to spin up a full lakehouse or manage Flink.Any thoughts or insights that can help us get out of this mess?EDIT - Fixed typo.",

Even better if you can get some analyst experience and have data engineering experience. This will get you a seat at the table with more important business stakeholders.I had a lot of hope that I would develop this type of domain knowledge, but I ended up just being assigned data platform work or data ingestion work where domain knowledge is almost not required Even after asking to be moved to positions that provide this kind of experience, I am not provided with those opportunities.",

The repository has everything you need to run it yourself.Find the project on GitHub: https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/tree/main/projects/mobile-game-top-k-analyticsAnd if you want an easy way to spin up the necessary infrastructure (Kafka, Flink, etc.) on your local machine, check out our Factor House Local project: https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-localFeedback, questions, and contributions are very welcome!",

When I try to study with MOOCs or read books alone, I drop off quickly. So I’m considering **enrolling in a postgrad certificate or structured course**, even if it’s not the most elite one — just to have *external pressure* and deadlines. I care about building real skill, not networking or titles.# What I’m looking for:* A **practical learning path**, preferably with hands-on projects and real tech* Structure that helps me stay accountable* Deepening my skills in: Airflow (advanced), PySpark/Spark, Kafka, SQL, cloud-based pipelines, testing, CI/CD* Willing to invest time and money if it helps me build solid skills# Questions:* Has anyone here gone through something similar — what helped you push through the discipline barrier?* Any recommendations for **serious technical courses** (e.g. Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, ProjectPro, Coursera, others)?* Are structured certs or postgrad programs worth it for people like me who need external accountability?* Would a “nanodegree” (e.g. Udacity) be overkill or the right fit?Any thoughts are welcome. Honesty is appreciated — I just want to get better and build a real career.Is it really just \"get your sh\\*t together and create a personal project\". Is it that easy for most of you guys?

The pipelines I build are fairly small and nothing too heavy.I’ve been given a project that’s actually very important for the business, but the standard here is still batch files and task scheduler. That’s how I’ve been told to run things. It works, but only just. The CPU on the VM is starting to brick it, but you know, that will only matter as soon as it breaks..I use Linux at home and I’m comfortable in the terminal. Not an expert of course but keen to take on a challenge. I want to containerise my work with Docker so I can keep things clean and consistent. It would also let me apply proper practices like versioning and CI/CD.If I want to use Docker properly, it really needs to be running on a Linux environment. But I know that asking for anything outside Windows will probably get some pushback, we’re on prem so I doubt they’ll approve a cloud environment. I get the vibe that running code is a bit of mythical concept to the rest of the team, so explaining dockers pros and cons will be a challenge. So is it worth trying to make the case for a Linux VM? Or do I just work around the setup I’ve got and carry on with patchy solutions? What’s the general vibe on docker/linux at other companies, it seems pretty mainstream right?I’m obviously quite new to DE, but I want to do things properly. Open to positive and negative comments, let me know if I’m being a dipshit lol",

You can load data from PDFs, transcripts, spreadsheets, databases, integrations, etc., and pull structured tables directly from it. The output is always a table you can use downstream. You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.The workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets. There is a RAG agent as well, I have a vectordb attached.In the gui on the left is the table and on the right, there’s a chat interface. Behind the scenes, it analyzes the table you’re looking at, figures out what kinds of Python/SQL operations could apply, and suggests them. You pick one, it builds the code, runs it, and shows you the result. (Still working on getting the python/SQL thing in the GUI, getting close)Would anyone here use something like this??? The goal is let you publish the workflows to business people so they can use it themselves without dealing with prompts.Anyhow, I am really interested in what the community thinks about something like this. I'd prefer not to state what the website is etc here, just DM me if you want to play with it. Still rough on the edges.\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\* Thanks to everyone who reached out. A lot of people asked for a demo video, so I put one together. It starts with a real use case: a customer receives a weekly report that breaks down feature requests and related metrics.This is just one example. What makes this platform different is accuracy and flexibility. There are plenty of polished tools built for product teams (and to be clear this tool is not marketed as a dedicated tool for PMs). We offer the same insights, but without the fluff. Raw data goes in, and you get structured tables or written reports out. You can push results into tools like Jira or Aha, or plug them into your own dashboards, or just query data in our interface.It also supports broader use cases. Need to convert 1,000 PDFs that are dumped in a Google Drive each day into a Google Sheets and into S3 for purchasing managers? No problem.The platform supports up to 1GB of data with a built-in vector store.So at its core, it is an AI-native ETL engine built for unstructured-to-structured or vector store workflows. We are also working on a simple, center-screen chatbot that gives execs access only to what you choose to publish. Here's the youtube, follow us! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdOKeSq8E4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdOKeSq8E4k)FYI - right now this is a closed beta. We have a general waiting list.

It took what I went through, and still going through, for me to post this.****So, Chris Garzon..., Lets talk about him a moment. This is a guy who couldn't give a sh!t about his students/clients. Unless, of course, they pay him a crazy amount of money. And, I found recently, he isnt as good as he says he is. There is so much I want to say here but it may incriminate some folks so I must digress. Just know, Chris is not a good person. He has a great face for his commercials and has a good mop of hair. On top of that, he uses some good taglines in his commercials. At first, his commercials targeted noobs like me. He made it seem like this was easy and they were here to help. What a crock of shit.****I started learning SQL (which I found out was free). If you have a question about something you are learning, you are asked to place the question in a slack channel that is provided to you. The question sits there until someone gets around to it which is usually the next day. A lot of the time the CSM (Client Success Manager) would tell you to \"check chatgpt\" or \"Look it up on youtube\". What? Isnt that what I paid OVER $10K for? For you to assist me? Sorry to inconvenience your day. Its hard for anyone studying to come across a question or logic that is hard to understand and just need a quick answer.** **Calls for study would happen but the instructor didnt show a few times. They have been better about that. DEA even created a discord channel and right when people were using it, they took it away. At first they were all about \"Study Buddies\". Find yourself a partner and study with them. Great, so you do that and use the discord but then they take it away. Back to square 1. Studying on my own with no one to ask questions or anything. I felt lost.** **Then, a number of months go by and we see a new add from Chris. He was marketing different. \"You must make between $150k-$200k and have a couple years of experience OR KEEP SCROLLING\" was the new tagline. Everyone was up in arms. Some guy on the site made a post about it. He called Chris out and everything. He was pretty respectful too. I wouldn't have been. To think they scammed the new comers, me. To think that the job security they talked about is now gone and out the window. What pieces of crap!****Then... Python starts and the instructor is insufferable. The course is horrible. Not much else to say about that other than I paid over $10k to change my career and become a data engineer and I have to go buy another course because the one I was ripped off for is absolutely terrible.** **Now, not everything is bad. There have been some good teachers and mindset coaches. Payal was amazing and she got tired of the place and quit.** **It would be in your best interest to look elsewhere for your education as a data engineer, even if you are experienced. Dont fall for the commercials.****#whatdidigetmyselfinto** **Me...**",

        "content": "Hey everyone!We just released an open-source Airflow provider that solves a problem we've all faced - getting reliable alerts when DAGs fail or don't run on schedule. Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.With just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (\"did the nightly job run?\") and execution health (\"did it finish within 4 hours?\"). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings: from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout... dag = DAG(\"nightly_dag\", ...) # Enable tracking with one line! enable_telomere_tracking(dag)It integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.Check out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.Would love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",

[https://dlthub.com/blog/dlt-and-sling-comparison](https://dlthub.com/blog/dlt-and-sling-comparison)The tldr: \\- The pyarrow backend used by dlt is generally the best: fast, low memory and CPU usage. You can speed it up further with parallelism. \\- Sling costs 3x more hardware resources for the same work compared to any of the dlt fast backends, which i found surprising given that there's not much work happening, SQL copy is mostly a data throughput problem.All said, while I believe choosing dlt is a no-brainer for pythonic data teams (why have tool sprawl with something slower in a different tech), I appreciated the simplicity of setting up sling and some of their different approaches.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,Is anyone here using GitHub for managing Power BI assets (semantic models, reports, CI/CD workflows)?We're currently migrating from Azure DevOps to GitHub, since most of our data stack (Airflow, dbt, etc.) already lives there.That said, setting up a clean and user-friendly CI/CD workflow for Power BI in GitHub is proving to be painful:We tried Fabric Git integration directly from the workspace, but this isn't working for us — too rigid and not team-friendly.Then we built GitHub Actions pipelines connected to Jira, which technically work — but they are hard to integrate into a local workflow (like VS Code). The GitHub Actions extension feels clunky and not intuitive.Our goal is to find a setup that is:Developer-friendly (ideally integrated in VS Code or at least easy to trigger without manual clicking),Not overly complex (we considered building a Streamlit UI with buttons, but that’s more effort than we can afford right now),Seamless for deploying Power BI models and reports (models go via Fabric CLI, reports via deployment pipelines).I know most companies just use Azure DevOps for this — and honestly, it works great. But moving to GitHub was a business decision, so we have to make it work.Has anyone here implemented something similar using GitHub successfully?Any tips on tools, IDEs, Git integrations, or CLI-based workflows that made your life easier?Thanks in advance!",

When he was in my place he decided to use Talend with Redshift. He's quite proud of this, and wants every pipeline to use Talend.My fellow engineers have found workarounds that minimize our exposure to it, and are basically using it for orchestration only, so the boss is happy.We finally have a new use case, which will be, as far as I can tell, the first streaming pipeline we'll have. I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”. (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).Of course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing. I'm fine with using it to shift from S3 to Redshift to keep him happy, but would appreciate some examples of why not to use Talend streaming over MSK.Thank you in advance r/dataengineering community!",

        "content": "Hello everyone,I recently transitioned from a Data Analyst to a Data Engineer role at a startup and I'm facing a significant architectural challenge. I would appreciate any advice or guidance.**The Current Situation:**We have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.This architecture has led to two major problems:1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.**My Question:**How can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.**ETL Details:*** The entire pipeline is written in Python.* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily). The main pain point is the constant manual effort required to adapt to schema changes.Thank you in advance for any suggestions",

I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.### What's inside:* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing### Known limitations:* Not memory-efficient (yet)* Feature set is evolving### Links:* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)* Docs:  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)  or  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)I'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!Thanks!",

The system classifies queries as textual or visual and dynamically weights the results, executing both searches in parallel via the multi-search API, then merging results using weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Our main bottleneck is running and merging two separate queries, one for KNN and one for BM25, which currently results in an average response time of 7–10 seconds. Has anyone optimized a similar setup or found effective ways to reduce latency for this kind of hybrid search? Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated!",

        "content": "We’re currently exploring a fairly radical shift in our backend architecture, and I’d love to get some feedback.Our current system is based on MongoDB combined with Atlas Search. We’re considering replacing it entirely with DuckDB + Ducklake, working directly on Parquet files stored in S3, without any additional database layer.• Users can update data via the UI, which we plan to support using inline updates (DuckDB writes). • Analytical jobs that update millions of records currently take hours – with DuckDB, we’ve seen they could take just minutes. • All data is stored in columnar format and compressed, which significantly reduces both cost and latency for analytic workloads.To support Ducklake, we’ll be using PostgreSQL as the catalog backend, while the actual data remains in S3.The only real pain point we’re struggling with is retrieving a record by ID efficiently, which is trivial in MongoDB.So here’s my question: Does it sound completely unreasonable to build a production-grade system that relies solely on Ducklake (on S3) as the primary datastore, assuming we handle write scenarios via inline updates and optimize access patterns?Would love to hear from others who tried something similar – or any thoughts on potential pitfalls.",

Some of the local/global style sheets I couldn't figure out where they were applicable to other components until further digging. And then there was the issue of the UI library itself and it's own self-imposed CSS rules. I wrote what felt like the most ridiculously specific selectors just update some simple component UI because otherwise, nothing worked. Honestly, if I could've just coded it in bare HTML/CSS/JS, it probably would've taken 30 minutes at max. Instead, it took me half a day. Am I just really slow?",

I wasn’t expecting big changes because they were busy with coursework and exam prep and didn’t have much time to practice between sessions. To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.This experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials. I used to think problem-solving was different that you had to grind endlessly to “figure it out.” In college, I spent countless hours on Codeforces (eventually reaching ~1900 rating and I remember feeling soo excited) and told others, including my brother to just practice more.

        "content": "Hey folks,I'm currently learning web development, and I’ve been trying to escape this thing everyone calls \"tutorial hell.\" Instead of just following along with videos, my strategy has been something like this:1. I find a project with source code (usually from GitHub or a course).2. I go through the code and figure out which parts I don’t understand.3. I take crash courses or quick tutorials on those missing concepts.4. Then I try to rebuild the project from scratch on my own.I’ve seen a lot of people here say that building your own stuff is the key, and I totally get that. But as a beginner, building something *completely* on my own still feels a bit overwhelming. So this method has been kind of a middle ground for me. I’m currently thinking to work on 3–4 projects using this approach.Just wondering — does this sound like a good learning path? Has anyone else tried something similar or got any tips to improve it?Would love to hear your thoughts!",

Im currently reading \"Automate the boring stuff with Python\" which is great, but after learning and \"understanding\" what it says, when i try to make a simple program i just brain fart so bad. In C++ i can make a simple program with all sorts of basic functions, read to file, write from file, etc. Ask me to iterate through a list and insert items in Python and wallahi im cooked.

I have no CS work experience, no internships, or anything professional under my belt. I’m honestly lost on where to start.I've taken time off and I can dedicate 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, to learning until December to- as they say- \"figure my life out\" and \"get my shit together.\" I need a clear, up-to-date path that won’t lead me to dead ends. My husband and I are fortunate to make this sacrifice (I currently work as an elementary school teacher(long story), but I’m terrified of wasting time. I’m worried that come November, when I’m ready to apply for jobs, I’ll realize I focused on the wrong things and I’m still unprepared.I’ve done some research online, but it feels like staring into a void. I see posts about people with 5+ years of experience struggling to get jobs and others saying there’s no way a newbie like me will land a role.  Any advice on how to approach this? What should I do for the next 4 months to be job-ready by December? Any specific field that's more fruitful than the rest?I was thinking of doing **AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate** certificate - however I read it's impossible to land a job without experience in the workforce. I was thinking of doing iOS- but again - the competition is cut throat- truly im at such a loss.

My last couple of review cycles have been positive overall but have highlighted some areas that I feel like are quite big weaknesses for me and that I am not sure how to improve at.It took me a very long time to get to the level of being a steady junior contributor who can be given a task and reasonably trusted to implement it with some guidance and instruction from more senior engineers (partially slow adjustment period on my part, partially poor management during COVID) but I really feel like I've hit a plateau and don't know how to get out of it. The main feedback I'm getting is that I need to do more code reviews and speak up more in meetings to discuss design - my work is fine in and of itself (though I feel my ability to design things and push my projects forward is a bit lacking) but I have very little impact on the wider team. I feel like I don't know how to analyse code or review it at all, that I have no deep understanding or knowledge. I can execute tasks well but really struggle a lot with designing solutions to problems or critiquing designs to suggest improvements or point out potential holes. When I try to review code I can spot simple mistakes, but amn't able to give anything more indepth (pointing out areas of refactoring, inefficiencies, suggesting alternative ways of solving the problem) and don't know where to start. When I start looking at reviews I can just feel my mind go blank instead of being able to break down the review and think through what's going on with it or what could be done better.Because I've been working in this career for quite some time I feel bad even asking for help, I've managed to struggle my way through it so far but it's very stressful and I don't want to feel so incompetent and afraid when doing my job.

After a week of doing them I forgot them I just can not get the idea to solve them but when I am revising or solving them I can do them pretty well. Every time after a week I dont remember or it takes me some time to solve them it feels new to me even after solving them multiple times. I just feel very disappointed.I had been sick for a week now and I have not done any programming, I had a interview today where I was asked to write the code to find larger number in a list and print the prime numbers in a list. I know that I have solved them before but I just could not solve them . It feels like coding is not for me but I like to code. I dont know why is it happening . Is there any way I can get good at coding or is it just not for me. Thanks for reading and any help will be appreciated.",

        "author": "tree332",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. I had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.In linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor. I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems, but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \\*any\\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation. In discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me. In intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.I ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.I have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school. I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year, but I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS degree curriculum on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.When I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. when I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as \"how to draw a 2d triangle program\" opens up a new journey learning the opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.I have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. I then go back to an \"intro to java/python/c# course\" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.I'm not quite sure how to move forward.",

I see so many job postings and new projects built with this combination. I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on why this happens.Is it simply because they're a \"safe\" and established choice? Are there specific technical advantages that make them so popular, or is it a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where everyone learns them because they're popular, which in turn makes them more popular?On a related note, this got me thinking about languages that were once super popular but have since fallen out of favor. For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options? Was it a lack of features, performance issues, or did other languages just innovate faster?I'd love to hear your insights and experiences! No wrong answers here, just genuinely curious about the community's perspective. Thanks in advance!",

I don't have a job in programming, only have 1 major project under my belt, and I still have a lot to learn.Now for my advice that I wished I knew when I started out: code by discipline, not by inspiration.What do I mean by this? Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.Anyways, that's my advice.

I've recently been intrigued by computer vision right now but again, all of this confuses me what should i really study to land me something fruitful.I am just really confused what field I should be choosing for future. Can anyone guide me? Also, I flagged this debugging because I want to debug my life (its supposed to be a good joke :p)",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm currently in university and have only learned the *very basics* of C and some other things related to programing and Software Engineering. I got into an internship (called FTT) where I was placed in a project as a backend developer — but there wasn’t much onboarding or guidance.The project is a WhatsApp chatbot (not AI-based, just a menu tree of questions and answers to help students with common doubts about our university). The second part is a dashboard for professors to interact with “tickets” — messages from students that the bot couldn’t handle.At first, I was excited and learned a lot. I got exposed to things like databases, HTTP requests, backend frameworks, APIs… way more than I ever saw in class. But now I’m stuck. I don’t know what the next step is. I’m just staring at the codebase and feeling completely lost.To make things worse, the “client” (university professors) barely show up to clarify things. We don’t know what API to use for WhatsApp integration, and we’re not even sure if we’ll get access to a real number to test the bot properly.We had about a month of vacation, and during that time, I started learning Java. It felt cool — I like how structured it is. But despite that, I still feel like I don’t know how to code. I feel like I’m just copying code, Googling everything, and faking my way through things. I don’t feel like a “real” dev. Sometimes I feel like a fraud.I know this is all part of learning, but it’s hard not to feel lost or like I’m falling behind.Has anyone else been through something like this? Any advice on how to push through this kind of block?",

        "content": "I guess it's more of a productivity question. Often times, I find myself wanting to build multiple projects, contribute to existing ones, or learn new technologies. The problem is I can only focus on one task at a time. These tasks usually require deep focus, making it impossible to effectively switch between them.For example, I have a couple of pet projects, and when I return to either of them to make some changes, it always feels like starting from scratch - learning the codebase again, figuring out the code logic. Every time. Another example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time. I'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them? Maybe it's a silly question, but I'm genuinely curious how other people stay productive in these situations.",

To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.I need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \\~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.Unless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed. Is the the standard approach to just immediately serve images and accept the low levels of risk as a tradeoff for very fast UIs, or is there a better approach that I am unaware of?",

Because I realized I suck at coding so much and I’m struggling to improve.At first, I thought it was time investment ; I thought I simply wasn’t coding enough. Then I thought I just didnt know the syntax. Now, I’ve realized that u will most likely never know all the built in functions or the syntax, but u still should be able to code and solve problems. My biggest issue is this: I dont think I ever approached compsci in a correct way. I just thought if I solve enough questions, if I just see enough codes from the past, I’d be able to get past it like I did with other subjects in high school but it’s not true. The more I try to become better, the more I realize the biggest issue is: I really don’t know how to break down big problems into smaller ones, know how to specify what kind of functions/ datatypes I will use, and solve the problem. I’ve just been learning the syntax, never deeply dove down to the core of the problem, and relying on ai when there are parts I dont know how to fix. And to make things worse, I really dont know how to practice these things. The more I look at what I’m doing, I’m realizing more that I have really shaky foundations in computer science, and I’m scared because I know in a couple weeks, I’d just have assignments and exams flooding, possibly without fixing the core issues I need to fix. I really dont want to continue ‘barely passing’ all my subjects over and over and end up graduating as a C/D tier software engineer who can easily be replaced. I would really appreciate help. Books, any type of online practice for this kind of thinking. I’m often overwhelmed even by leetcode style questions where there are multiple things i need to do for one program, and it’s like I start panicking completely and I dont know what to do or how to even approach the problem. When things get complicated, I simply don’t know where to begin with.I seriously feel so useless because I just recently found out I was focusing on the wrong thing the past two years. I can’t afford to give up now either. I NEED TO MAKE THIS WORK. Please help me :folded_hands:",

However, we have never written unit tests for the Java code. Was thinking to write unit tests on the Java methods that help support the Gherkin Syntax to catch any issues with our Gherkin integration tests, such as false positives, , ensure the syntax is working as intended, etc., but is that a good practice?Maybe I am overthinking it. I guess we can write unit tests for anything if we want to, but also not sure if we are writing tests for tests in this case, which I think might be a bad practice. It's more of tests for the Java code that allows QA to write the integration tests. I have only seen unit tests for a service's or library's functionality, but not for the tests in a way so was having some doubts.",

        "author": "YangLorenzo",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone! :waving_hand:I'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?A minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.**Core Features**:* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.* **Two wallpaper switch modes**: * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching). * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).#### Why I built thisAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.Originally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.--- **What’s new in 3.0.0*** :check_mark_button: Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)* :check_mark_button: Hotkey system* :check_mark_button: Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom* :check_mark_button: Better folder switching logic* :check_mark_button: System tray + auto-start support* :check_mark_button: UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below :backhand_index_pointing_down:)---**About the UI**I initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.I uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.---**Architecture decisions*** **Two-project structure**: * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs). * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.---**Tech stack*** C# (.NET 9)* WinForms* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)---:package: **Project & Source Code**:backhand_index_pointing_right: GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)Any feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.Thank you all for reading! :folded_hands:If you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!",

After that it breaks out the loop and the next if statement checks the bool value and since it's not false, the program ends. However my confusion is that since the bool variable was set to false from the start, isn't the for loop checking that as long as the program is within the bounds of the vector and that the foundCountry is now true (since !foundCountry changes the value to true) execute the following within the loop statement? Wouldn't it make more for it to be set up as foundCountry == false? // Find country's index and average TV time foundCountry = false; for (i = 0; (i < ctryNames.size()) && (!foundCountry); ++i) { if (ctryNames.at(i) == userCountry) { foundCountry = true; cout << \"People in \" << userCountry << \" watch \"; cout << ctryMins.at(i) << \" mins of TV daily.\" << endl; } } if (!foundCountry) { cout << \"Country not found; try again.\" << endl; } return 0; }",

        "content": "After 4 years as a backend developer at my current company, I've decided to look for new opportunities. One of the main reasons is that my salary hasn't kept pace with industry standards, which has made me feel undervalued in my role.Over time, I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also tried to use my own knowledge and experience to improve my skills. Unfortunately, as one of the remote workers in the company, they are mobbing me to leave. As a result, my team pushing me to do tasks like meetings, ci/cd deployments and documentation. Limiting my work but I still do the coding stuff because Im the one who is pushing for it and I dont get any support from my team. It started be like this since last 2 years. First 2 years were great and I learned a lot in those times.I've found it tough to balance my work and personal life because of work times and getting tired from sitting for 8-10 hours. These has made it hard for me to find time to learn new things outside of work. I have applied for jobs but I've often struggled with basic development trivia questions because I haven't been keeping up as much as I'd like or memorizing about everything about the technology I used.In one of the applications that did showcase my skills was the one I created a microservice from stratch. But after the project interview they wanted me to write some basic code(reverse the string they provided). It took me a bit longer than expected to get it done because I wasnt going to write code in the interview from what they told, my laptop was in a way to show my face which didnt had room for me to write but I managed to write it with some debugging. It wasnt enough for them I think they just declined my application. I applied to here through a senior friend and they thought how did he create all of this by himself, must have got helped which I didnt get any.Anyway, now I'm feeling a bit stuck and unsure about how to move forward. Despite knowing a lot about project structures and API design, backend development etc... I'm not feeling like my skills are growing as quickly as I'd like. Im doing some leetcode, hackerrank examples and studying some topics (taking notes) but yet Its not enough or match the criteria for the applications. Sometimes I feel like I cant write code without looking to documentation or examples. And sometimes I cant write it out of my head, I know what to create or write as an idea but the functions or annotations are not in my memory all the time, I have to look for the usage.I'm wondering how can I make some changes or seek out new opportunities to learn and grow. Im really tired of this loop, feeling like exhausted but need a job for living. I keep learning, taking notes etc but Im still here without moving forward",

        "content": "Hello,I graduated this past June with a bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems. I’m aiming to get into front end web dev / software dev, but I’m seeing how tough it is for new grads with no experience. I'm honestly just hoping to land any position that relates to my degree now.The only job I’ve had is working at Burger King for a year. I know I messed up not doing internships during school. Skill-wise, I know HTML, CSS, some basic JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I’ve been working through The Odin Project but I’m only around halfway through the Foundations section. It’ll probably take me well into next year to finish the whole curriculum and ideally I’d like to be working before then.I know this kind of post probably shows up here a lot, and I’ve done a bit of googling and researching already. I guess I just want to feel more certain about what all my options really are, given my situation and in todays market (since it seems to shift around quickly).After researching, I'm wondering if I should just get my A+ cert and try to land a help desk job for now. I’d honestly prefer not to go that route, but if it’s the most realistic way to get a foot in the door, I’ll do it.So basically I’m wondering: – Is it still worth trying to get an internship now, even after graduating? – Are there other entry-level roles besides help desk that I can realistically land with my degree + skills in 2025? – Given where I’m at, what should I focus on most right now?Any advice or personal experience would be really appreciated. Just trying to get a better sense of direction. Thanks",

However making feature enhancements or UI tweaks was painful or just impossible. So I moved to coding myself in VS Code getting help from the Kilo Code extension.I've since completed crash courses in HTML, CSS, Tailwind, React and Nextjs. To get a better understanding of what is going on under the hood and make small changes myself to rely less on AI. I've built a couple more simple web apps hosted on vercel and supabase. Also learned git and pushing to github.Then I discovered Svelte and my life changed, it is amazing. Nextjs is fairly poopy in comparison. But there are very limited learning resources for Svelte5/Sveltekit working with supabase. The Svelte docs seem geared to experienced coders.Looking for any good resources to teach me webdev concepts e.g. when to use components, props, state, effects, best practices for API calls to the backend, etc. In one project I was manually calling the same component multiple times, then I saw a youtube video on how to use For Each to iterate through it. Is there a structured resource to help learn this stuff?",

        "content": "I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.That’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.So yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.I know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.What are your thoughts?",

        "author": "FredWeitendorf",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)Let me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may \"know\" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.Number one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?Number two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.Third most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they \"get it\"? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.None of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.Here are a few common examples:* Sending very flowery, \"fake personalized\", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to \"stand out\" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.*** Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**What these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**(cont. below: what to do instead)",

        "content": "Over a month ago, we had a regression testing deadline coming up. My manager reached out to me on Saturday to work on some bugs . I told her I was out of town and couldn’t work — which was true. I’ve got four kids and my weekends are usually packed, especially with no notice.The following Monday in standup, she brought it up — saying she should have communicated earlier, but also added that she expected the team to step up and work weekends to meet deadlines. I mentioned I wouldn’t be available the coming weekend either if that’s what she was expecting. It was my son’s birthday weekend. They worked til midnight that Saturday.For context: my manager has always been happy with my work. She’s consistently appreciated my contributions and never had any complaints about my performance. The only “issue” seems to be that I don’t volunteer for extra work. lol. She’s made comments in the past like she wants me to “see the bigger picture” and help other teams.A couple of weeks ago, she asked if I’d be available the second weekend of September for another deadline. At the time, I said I should be. But since then, my wife made plans for that weekend, so I updated my manager and told her I wouldn’t be available anymore in case she needs people to work.She wasn’t happy and said something like, “I can’t keep asking the same person to work on weekends,” referring to a coworker who regularly puts in 50–60 hours. I replied, “That’s a personal choice. I already stretch my weekdays beyond 40 hours. I choose to spend weekends with my family. If every release requires weekend work, then we have a process problem.”Now I’m brushing up my resume. Haven’t interviewed in over 10 years……",

The second one they had to let her go because they did some bad calculation around the budget they had and fired a couple of new people and she was one of them.She is getting really depressed with this despite being her dream, and I think she's not so bad that she can't find a job, there are really bad people out there, how can she not find one after all this energy and struggle. It makes me really sad to see her in this situation and would love to help her in any way possible.Since I use reddit regularly I wanted to ask people in this subreddit what we can do?We have optimized CV in every possible way, she did a portfolio, she's trying to find clients in the meanwhile. But a part from that, what can we realistically do? How can it be so hard after all the efforts?",

It’s the only proper job offer I’ve ever received. I came in at the minimum, making a bit over $50k. I was happy to finally have a job.The job is stable. Demands are more than reasonable. But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, \"why should we?\" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.I’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?Maybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.I had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of \"I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me.\" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.Maybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.I don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore? If I was, or could be, what would that even look like?",

Recently I got laid off due to \"business org restructuring\" bullshit yada yada.The problem I'm having isn't the job search itself, it sucks but it's always sucked and it always will suck because Capitalism is designed to suck us of our willpower to make us forfeit our deserved remittance in favour of ending the drudgery ASAP. That hasn't changed, though. It's always been that way.The problem isn't leetcode, because as stupid as the whole concept is fundamentally, I'm at least good enough at it to be able to handle them with some modicum of confidence, in spite of it being completely irrelevant to any work in the field.The problem isn't interviews, because in spite of this job being fairly insular (although not as much as most people believe), I have good soft skills from my last job especially being very interactive with many different teams.The problem is that *I fucking hate what tech has become in 2025.*90% of job ads are for gambling sites, crypto sites (but I repeat myself), or AI bullshit that's draining society for every penny it's worth while putting people out of their jobs without any plan for what happens when vast swathes of the population are trained in unemployable fields. It's feeding into a regime that I will withhold my feelings about so as not to get too political, but suffice it to say I vehemently disagree with. The rest of the job ads are so hotly contested and so few and far between that I have barely any shot of competing for them, and even those jobs are still mildly problematic, but at least it's only in the same old ways that they've always been (ie. Banking, marketing).Sorry if this has been said before by others but the feeling of needing to sell my soul to these companies that are speedrunning societal destruction makes me want to throw myself into a river rather than prostrate myself at their feet hoping a little bit of their plundered wealth trickles into my pockets.",

I rarely get asked for input in planning or architecture discussions. It’s like I’m just… there, floating.It’s not that I hate the work. I just thought by now I’d be doing more — maybe mentoring junior devs, leading small projects, or at least working on something that pushes me. But I feel invisible. I get decent performance reviews, but no real guidance on how to grow or get to the next level.What’s worse is, I don’t even know what to do differently. Speak up more? Build something on the side? Apply elsewhere? I keep waiting for some kind of sign that I’m ready, but I’m starting to realize that no one’s coming to hand me that next step.If you’ve been stuck in the “mid-level trap,” how did you break out of it?

For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.During my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.Lately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.Here's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I'll be looking into doing a Master's program and getting internships that way. I'll also try to monetize my app and leverage my skills to see if I can start turn it into a business.",

My title is plant supervisor but I have significant roles in other sectors. Im due for a promotion to distribution manager by the end of the year but I doubt I surpass the 75k salary mark. Online medians are higher but I have a feeling it will be less. I dont love my job. I wouldn't say I particularly like it either. Some parts yes but mostly not. I'm just good at learning and perfecting. I enjoy making processes efficient and error free. Investigating missing inventory is probably my favorite thing to do. Tracking and finding out who, where and why there's a discrepancy in the inventory count. I also have picked up roles along the way such as parts sales, service coordination, small machine repair (technician quit, they asked if I knew how to repair, said I'll try. Now I'm the small machine repair guy). I dont feel like I'm being compensated for any of the extra roles I fill.fill.This job is very stable. No reason to believe I'll ever be let go. Not a volatile market but slow to progress pay and I don't like doing most of it. Would I be committing career suicide to chase a career in tech? I only have a high-school diploma. I start college classes in a few weeks to work towards a BS in CS",

        "author": "SomeRandomCSGuy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. I am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. As a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. I realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).There is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.A lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. For these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. The documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.I worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. Don’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. So I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. If you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. Looking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!Happy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"In the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.For the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.Throughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.Fast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. At 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.No full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"Honestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.Truthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\" today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. Side note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.Is it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?I just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

No FAANG experience. I was looking for remote work in Canada, and felt like I was just on the cusp of applying to senior roles. I was careful in what roles I applied to - I didn't really want to work in advertising or wacky new AI start ups. The roles I applied to I either thought I'd absolutely love working there, or they would be a great fit for the specific skill set I was starting to build for myself. 3 YOE did turn out to be the edge of non-senior: I was offered a senior role by one company, a non-senior for another, and rejected by a third company because I wasn't quite senior enough. I think if you have a few years of experience, the job market is not as bad as people say it is. If you don't, then you might be SOL. I was also pleasantly surprised, none of the interviews were very leet-codey. They were mostly common sense, real-life kind of scenarios. I prepped about 100 leet code mediums before applying, which was a bit useless, but I think it gave me the confidence I needed in these interviews.",

Not even a screening call. I’m surprised because I thought the app would boost my success rates up from last year’s rounds of interviewing, which was also about 0.I’m wracking my brain to come up with why I’m failing to even get off the ground here. Could it be because I don’t have a degree in CS? I figured that would no longer matter at this point in my career, but maybe it does.",

My second manager made an 8 point per sprint requirement and said I didn’t have to do it, then it became a performance issue when I didn’t do it. Very confused. Now the thing is I “ask too many questions” and am not technically independent. I’m tired. I do all my stories. I never caused carry over or even a defect. I always take notes after asking a question so I never ask the same question twice. I have multiple certs. Was in a hackathon. If I’m struggling so much, how am I completing all my work before the deadline? When I ask a question, I always say what I tried first. I never ask without trying and saying what I tried because that’s annoying. I don’t communicate well with my tech lead because he always gets irritated very quickly towards me. Use to laugh and snap at me when I code constantly. Didn’t want to deal with that so I route questions elsewhere.Had multiple managers and they’re just like “oh if you just do x (replace x with study outside of work, try before asking a question, say what you tried before asking a question), then they’ll be nicer to you”. Like….ok….havent I been doing that for a year straight?And apparently performance reviews aren’t based on actual goals, but vibes. No one has given me goals yet. I don’t pass my tech leads vibe check so all feedback from him is negative. I don’t know what they want from me. How do I even improve at this point? I study outside of work, I use ai, like…do I just suck at my job? Do I suck at this field? I don’t get it. Went to hr, they said “sounds like you’re just complaining that you have to do your work.” I can get another job, but is that best? Is this a team specific problem? I think tech is cool, but is my brain just not cut for this?",

I have been in software development for years at consulting companies where clients ask to develop certain systems for their needs which are mostly CRUD with complex business rules, rarely realtime. Most of those solutions do not need large scale system design, you may use containers, may be K8s if you are lucky. But mostly do not need hundreds of microservices, CQRS, event-driven stuff. Even if we have freedom of tech stack we are doing disservice to client and future developers if you did something complicated for resume driven development. While I can try and learn new design patterns, good coding practices, there is no room to build things at scale.But when you look at jobs posts, they ask for things like microservices, event-driven design, CQRS, Kafka etc. So my question to those who were in similar situation before, **how to gain experience building things at scale when your work do not need things at scale?** It seems I have been stagnant years without opportunity to involve in systems that need scale.",

I have a dream of doing a CS PhD (probably in Europe) for Type Theory/Programming Language Theory, but I did Math in undergrad so all my letters of rec would have to come from the Masters.

I'm very passionate about theoretical CS but am kinda regretting the Math bachelors right now ;-;",

Then he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away \"it should be quick\". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work.

I've only recieved 3 interviews / non-automatic OA's since, and mostly from positions I was referred to. My resume is very heavily focussed on my Walmart experience, both my previous internship and full-time role. I enjoy coding but it is not some large passion of mine that I do in my free time, and most of my projects are either from University, which have very brief or no mentions in my resume. Should I still be building projects to put on my resume? Do companies really care much once you have real work experience? Am I hurting my chances by mostly applying to New Grad / < 1 YOE positions, as it seems there are less of them than the Entry level 1-2 YOE positions, but I only really have a few months of FT experience. I feel like I am in an awkward spot between New Grad Level, where many positions don't even start until 2026 and state they are exclusively for 2025-2026 Graduates, and the 1-2 YOE entry level roles.",

        "content": "When I was a teenager, I developed an interest in programming. I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.Should I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes? What does your career path look like?",

        "content": "8 years ago I completed a 2 year degree in CS. Got on the honour roll and everything, but couldn't afford to keep going. Luckily the job market was strong and I was able to find good paying jobs. I even worked with a few people who did the same, or were even self taught, over the years. I have 8 YOE now.I've been at my current employer for 4 years now. But last year new management took over, and things have been slowly going downhill. I would be surprised if we made it another year at this point. So I've started applying for jobs. I take my time and tailor the resume and cover letter to the posting, and I'm only applying for ones that I'm a good fit for. Despite this, I get rejected automatically. My best guess is that I'm being filtered out based on my degree. Even when it comes to posting that say they'll take equivalent experience. Even if the job only requires 4 years of experience and pays less than what I currently make.The problem is that I have a family and a mortgage and all that now, so I can't just drop everything and go back to school. I could do online classes, but there's no way I would be able to finish a degree before this company folds. What do I do?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "In 2026, I'm going to be a grad fresh out of college in Ireland. I want to break into high frequency trading as a SWE and had a roadmap set in my mind for how I would reach my goal in 2 - 3 years time. I wanted to have people's opinion on how realistic this is. Currently as part of my placement year (more like semester), I'm interning at IBM. I'm working on Db2 which is IBM's enterprise database solution. If I get a return offer, hopefully, this is what I'll continue working on. Now, I know to break into HFT, I'll need a lot of experience in C++ and I was hoping this opportunity would give me that. I have considered applying to HFT firms but I feel like I won't be able to make it past their interviews since I'm not prepared much in that area and also am quite inexperienced in C++. As Db2 is a database, I'm also getting experience in low latency/high transaction systems, solving concurrency problems. I feel like these are all skills HFT firms value. I understand I'll be lacking in the area of financial knowledge. After 2 years of working here, I hope to get a Master's done with a minor in Finance, after which I plan on applying to HFTs. Would you say this plan is realistic or are there some changes you would suggest? Thanks as always :)",

I don’t have a CS degree or any formal training, so I’m completely self-taught. For this project, I’d really appreciate your honest feedback.[https://github.com/MMCagdas/expense-tracker-api](https://github.com/MMCagdas/expense-tracker-api)The README file was written with the help of AI, but apart from that, I tried to avoid relying on AI as much as possible during the development process.My goal is to continue focusing on backend development and eventually find a job in the field. I’m very open to any kind of advice, how much further I need to progress to land an internship or entry-level job, what I could be doing better, or what I should avoid completely.\\*edit:Thank you so much for all your comments! I'm currently trying to work on a project using TypeScript. Coming from JavaScript, the errors and project setup feel a bit strange at first, but from what I’ve seen, moving forward with TypeScript seems like the most sensible path. Thanks again to everyone!",
