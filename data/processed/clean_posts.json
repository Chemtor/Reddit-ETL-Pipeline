I am also studying Software Engineering at the moment.I've been working in isolated environments for the past 3 years which prevents me from using modern cloud platforms. Most of my time in DE has been on the platform side, not the data side. Since I joined the field, DevOps, MLOPs, LLMs, RAG and Data Lakehouse have been added to our responsibility on top of the old Modern Data Stack and Data Warehouses. This stack covers all of the use cases I have faced so far. These are my current recommendations for each of those problems in a self hosted, open source environment (with the exception of vibe coding, I haven't found any model good enough to do so yet). You don't need all of these tools, but you could use them all if you needed to. Solve the problems you have with the minimum tools you can. I have been working on guides on how to deploy the stack in docker/kubernetes on my site, [www.datacraftsman.com.au](http://www.datacraftsman.com.au), but not all of them are finished yet... I've been vibe coding data engineering tools instead as it's a fun distraction. I hope these resources help you make a better decision with your architecture.Comment below if you have any advice on improving the stack with reasons why, need any help setting up the tools or want to understand my choices and I'll try my best to help.",

No demo, just bold claims in a post.We tried to set realistic expectations and even did a demo to show how it actually works. Unsurprisingly, when you connect GenAI to tables without any context, metadata, or table descriptions, it spits out bad SQL, hallucinates, and confidently shows completely wrong data.And of course... drum roll... it’s our fault. Because apparently we “can’t do it like that guy on LinkedIn.”I’m not saying this stuff isn’t possible—it is—but it’s a project. There’s no magic switch. If you want good results, you need to describe your data, inject context, define business logic, set boundaries… not just connect and hope for miracles.How do you deal with this kind of crap? When influencers—who clearly don’t understand the tech deeply—start shaping stakeholder expectations more than the actual engineers and data people who’ve been doing this for years?Maybe I’m just pissed, but this hype wave is exhausting. It's making everything harder for those of us trying to do things right.",

I work sometimes 12+ hours a day including weekends and it feels no matter how hard I play 'catch up' there's still neverending work that I never truly felt caught up. I feel dissapointed honestly, I hoped my current job would help me land somewhere more in the engineering space after working in analytics for so long but my job ultimately makes me feel like I will never be able to escape all the annoyingness that comes with working in analytics or data science in general.My ideal job would be another more technical DE role, backend engineering or platform engineering within the same general domain area - I do not have a formal CS background.

Jupyter notebooks and the whole DS package, to completely and finally document the data pipeline _and the data quality_, before the data analysts can lay their eyes on the data. And at that point it's considered a failure if I need to make some change. I feel like this is very waterfall like, and slows us down, because they could have gotten the data much faster if I don't have to spend time doing basically what they should be doing either way, and probably will do again. If there was a genuine intentional feedback loop between us, we could move much faster than what were doing. But now it's considered failure if an adjustment is needed or an additional column must be added etc after the pipeline is documented, which must be completed before they will touch the data.I actually don't mind doing data analysis on a personal level, but it's weird that a data starved data science team doesn't want more data and sooner, and do this analysis themselves?",

Still, I’d really like to start the job being reasonably prepared, knowing the basics of how things work, and become independent in the project as quickly as possible.I’ve been thinking about what the most important elements of Databricks I should focus on learning first would be. Could you give me some advice on that?Secondly – I don’t know Terraform, and I’ll mostly be using it here for managing Databricks: setting up job deployments (to the right cluster, with the right permissions, etc.). Is this something difficult, or is it realistic to get a good understanding of Terraform and Databricks-related components in a few days?

That seems...incredibly expensive.Or would they pre-aggregate at a higher granularity, potentially sacrificing some dimensions in the progress, to accelerate their dashboards?This way you could just group by hour + ad_id + dim1 + dim2 ... and then run sum(clicks) / sum(impressions) to get a CTR estimate.

GizmoSQL is powered by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and [Apache Arrow Flight SQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html)We launched a `r8gd.metal-48xl` EC/2 instance (costing $14.1082 on-demand, and $2.8216 spot) in region: `us-east-1` using script: `launch_aws_instance.sh` in the attached zip file. We have an S3 end-point in the VPC to avoid egress costs.That script calls script: `scripts/mount_nvme_aws.sh` which creates a RAID 0 storage array from the local NVMe disks - creating a single volume that has: 11.4TB in storage.We launched the GizmoSQL Docker container using `scripts/run_gizmosql_aws.sh` \\- which includes the AWS S3 CLI utilities (so we can copy data, etc.).We then copied the S3 data from `s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc/` to the local NVMe RAID 0 array volume - using attached script: `scripts/copy_coiled_data_from_s3.sh` \\- and it used: 2.3TB of the storage space. This copy step took: 11m23.702s (costing $2.78 on-demand, and $0.54 spot).We then launched GizmoSQL via the steps after the docker stuff in: `scripts/run_gizmosql_aws.sh` \\- and connected remotely from our laptop via the Arrow Flight SQL JDBC Driver - (see repo: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql) for details) - and ran this SQL to create a view on top of the parquet datasets: CREATE VIEW measurements_1trc AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('data/coiled-datasets-rp/1trc/*.parquet'); Row count:We then ran the test query: SELECT station, min(measure), max(measure), avg(measure) FROM measurements_1trc GROUP BY station ORDER BY station; It took: 0:02:22 (142s) the first execution (cold-start) - at an EC/2 on-demand cost of: $0.56, and a spot cost of: $0.11It took: 0:02:09 (129s) the second execution (warm-start) - at an EC/2 on-demand cost of: $0.51, and a spot cost of: $0.10See: [https://github.com/coiled/1trc/issues/7](https://github.com/coiled/1trc/issues/7) for scripts, etc.Side note: Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM measurements_1trc;` takes: 21.8s",

        "content": "To provide measurable benchmarks, there is a need for standardized tasks and challenges that each participant can perform and solve. While these comparisons may not capture all differences, they offer a useful understanding of performance speed. For this purpose, Coiled / Dask have introduced a challenge where data warehouse engines can benchmark their reading and aggregation performance on a dataset of 1 trillion records. This dataset contains temperature measurement data spread across 100,000 files. The data size is around 2.4TB.**The challenge**“Your task is to use any tool(s) you’d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3: s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also generate the data yourself.”**The Result**The Apache Impala community was eager to participate in this challenge. For Impala, the code snippets required are quite straightforward — just a simple SQL query. Behind the scenes, all the parallelism is seamlessly managed by the Impala Query Coordinator and its Executors, allowing complex processes to happen effortlessly in a parallel way.**Article**https://itnext.io/the-one-trillion-row-challenge-with-apache-impala-aae1487ee451?source=friends_link&sk=eee9cc47880efa379eccb2fdacf57bb2**Resources**The query statements for generating the data and executing the challenge are available at https://github.com/boroknagyz/impala-1trc",

Things like:•What’s a recursive query?•Difference between a relational DB and a data warehouse?•How to delete duplicates from a table?•Difference between a stored procedure and a function?and a few more in the same category.When I asked about the team’s mission or who the stakeholders are, he just said “there aren’t one but many.” I mentioned I’m a fast learner and can quickly ramp up, and his reply was, “There won’t be time to learn. You’ll need to code from day one.”Is this normal for tech rounds in data engineering?

This pipeline uses AI agents (orchestrated with LangChain/LangGraph and powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to:* **Plan** data transformation strategies.* **Generate** production-ready PySpark code.* **Review** the generated code for quality and correctness.* **Execute** transformations across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.* Crucially, **self-correct** by revising code and retrying in case of errors.It aims for a truly zero-touch, self-healing data flow, with integrated observability via LangSmith.As a CS undergrad, this is my first significant venture into building a comprehensive data transformation agent like this. I've learned a ton about integrating LLMs with data platforms.I'd be incredibly grateful if you seasoned data engineers could check it out. Any feedback on the architecture, agent design patterns, PySpark optimization, scalability considerations, or general best practices would be immensely valuable for me.**:open_book: Deep Dive (Article):** [https://medium.com/@codehimanshu24/revolutionizing-etl-an-agentic-medallion-data-pipeline-on-databricks-72d14a94e562](https://medium.com/@codehimanshu24/revolutionizing-etl-an-agentic-medallion-data-pipeline-on-databricks-72d14a94e562)",

Here are my recognized weaknesses:- Always get rejected becoz of the DSA in technical tests (so I’m grinding LeetCode everyday)- Lack of work exp for some frameworks that I mentioned- Lack of C++ work exp- Lack of big scale exp (like processing TB data, clustering) ——Your advice on these topics is definitely valuable for me:1. Evaluate my profile and suggest any improvements in any areas related to data and quant2. What kind of side project should I work on to showcase my capabilities (I may think of sth like analyzing 1PB data, streaming market data for a trading system)3. Any must-have foundation or advanced concepts to become senior data eng (eg data lakehouse / delta lake / data mesh, OLAP vs OLTP, ACID, design pattern, etc)4. Your best approach of choosing the most suitable tool / framework / architecture5. Any valuable feedback Thank you so much of reading a long post, eager to get your professional feedback for continuous growth!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hopefully this is the correct subreddit. Not sure where else to ask. Premise: So our application has a requirement from the C-suite executives to be active-active. The goal for this discussion is to understand whether Mongo or Postgres makes the most sense to achieve that. Background: It is a containerized microservices application in EKS. Currently uses Oracle, which we’ve been asked to stop using due to license costs. Currently it’s single region but the requirement is to be multi region (US east and west) and support multi master DB.Details: Without revealing too much sensitive info, the application is essentially an order management system. Customer makes a purchase, we store the transaction information, which is also accessible to the customer if they wish to check it later. User base is 15 million registered users. DB currently had ~87TB worth of data. The schema looks like this. It’s very relational. It starts with the Order table which stores the transaction information (customer id, order id, date, payment info, etc). An Order can have one or many Items. Each Item has a Destination Address. Each Item also has a few more one-one and one-many relationships. My 2-cents are that switching to Postgres would be easier on the dev side (Oracle to PG isn’t too bad) but would require more effort on that DB side setting up pgactive, Citus, etc. And on the other hand switching to Mongo would be a pain on the dev side but easier on the DB side since the shading and replication feature pretty much come out the box. I’m not an experienced architect so any help, advice, guidance here would be very much appreciated.",

I was reflecting on what else my degree could be useful for, and I did a lot of data analytics and visualization, with a close friend of mine who was a math major just landing a very well paying Analytics job. This genuinely has me thinking of going back for MS in some data-related field.If you think this is a good idea, what programs/schools/masters do you recommend?

Reporting is mainly done via downloading files from the ERP and importing it into PowerBI or excel. For some projects we call the api of the ERP to get the data. Other specialized Applications sit on Top of the SQL databases.Problems: Most of the Reports get fed manually and we really want to get them to run automatically (including data cleaning), which would save a lot of time. Also, the many sources of Data cause a lot of confusion, as internal clients are not always sure where the Data comes from and how up to date it is. Combining data sources is also very painful right now and work feels very redundant. This is why i would like to Build a „single source of truth“.My idea is to Build a analytics database, most likely a data Warehouse according to kimball. I understand how it works theoretically, but i have never done it. I have a masters in business Informatics (Major in Business Intelligence and System Design) and have read the kimball Book. SQL knowledge is very Basic, but i am very motivated to learn.My questions to you are:1.⁠⁠is this a project that i could handle myself without any practical experience? Our IT Department is very small and i only have one colleague that could support a little with database/sql stuff. I know python and have a little experience with prefect. I have no deadline and i can do courses/certs if necessary.2.⁠⁠My current idea is to start with Open source/free tools. BigQuery, airbyte, dbt and prefect as orchestrator. Is this a feasible stack or would this be too much overhead for the beginning? Bigquery, Airbyte and dbt are new to me, but i am motivated to learn (especially the Latter)I know that i will have to do a internal Research on wether this is a feasible project or not, also Talking to stakeholders and defining processes. I will do that before developing anything. But i am still wondering if any of you were in a similar situation or if some More experienced DEs have a few hints for me. Thanks :)",

Source -> BI ToolLonger version:Coming from being \"the excel guy\" I've recently been promoted to analytics engineer (whether or not that's justified is a discussion for another time and place).My company's reporting was entirely build upon me accessing source systems like our ERP and CRM through SQL directly and feeding that into Excel via power query.Due to growth in complexity and demand this isn't a sustainable way of doing things anymore, hence me being tasked with BI-ifying that stuff.Now, it's been a while (read \"a decade\") since the last time I've come into contact with dimensional modeling, kimball and data warehousing.But that's more or less what I know or rather I can get my head around, so naturally that's what I proposed to build.Our development team is seeing things differently saying that storing data multiple times would be unacceptable and with the amount of data we have performance wouldn't be either.They propose to build custom APIs for the various source systems and feeding those directly into whatever BI tool we choose (we are 100% on-prem so powerBI is out of the race, tableau is looking good rn).And here is where I just don't know how to argue. How valid is their point? Do we even need a data warehouse (or lakehouse and all those fancy things I don't know anything about)?One argument they had was that BI tools come with their own specialized \"database\" that is optimized and much faster in a way we could never build it manually.But do they really? I know Excel/power query has some sort of storage, same with powerBI but that's not a database, right?I'm just a bit at a loss here and was hoping you actual engineers could steer me in the right direction.Thank you!",

Can I do it with SQLAlchemy taking a Polars dataframe as an input?The complete data pipeline looks like this:- read in flat file (xlsx/CSV/JSON) with Polars- perform some data wrangling operations with Polars- upsert data to SQL Server (with table operation 'Create table if not exists')What I also found in a Stackoverflow post regarding Upserts with Polars:```df1 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"inner\") .select(df_new.columns) ) df2 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") ) df3 = ( df_old .join(df_new, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") ) df_all = pl.concat([df1, df2, df3])```Or with `pl.update()` I could perform an Upsert inside Polars:```df.update(new_df, left_on=[\"A\"], right_on=[\"C\"], how=\"full\")```With both options though, I would have to read in the respective table from the database first, perform the Upsert with Polars and then write the output to the database again. This feels like 'overkill' to me?...Anyways, thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on a project where I'm building a pipeline to organize, analyze, and visualize experimental data from different batches. The goal is to help my team more easily view and compare historical results through an interactive web app.Right now, all the experiment data is stored as CSVs in a shared data lake, which allows for access control, only authorized users can view the files. Initially, I thought it’d be better to load everything into a database like PostgreSQL, since structured querying feels cleaner and would make future analytics easier. So I tried adding a batch_id column to each dataset and uploading everything into Postgres to allow for querying and plotting via the web app. But since we don’t have a cloud SQL setup, and loading all the data into a local SQL instance for new user every time felt inefficient, I didn’t go with that approach.Then I discovered DuckDB, which seemed promising since it’s SQL-based and doesn’t require a server, and I could just keep a database file in the shared folder. But now I’m running into two issues: 1) Streamlit takes a while to connect to DuckDB every time, and 2) the upload/insert process is for some reason troublesome and need to take more time to maintain schema and structure etc.So now I’m stuck… in a case like this, is it even worth loading all the CSVs into a database at all? Should I stick with DuckDB/SQL? Or would it be simpler to just use pandas to scan the directory, match file names to the selected batch, and read in only what’s needed? If so, would there be any issues with doing analytics later on? Would love to hear from anyone who’s built a similar visualization pipeline — any advice or thoughts would be super appreciated!",

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL Debezium CDC connectors as of now. As per my understanding, the reason MongoDB and PostgreSQL connectors need the heartbeat mechanism is that both MongoDB and PostgreSQL notify the connector of the changes in the subscribed collections/tables (using MongoDB change streams and PostgreSQL publications) and if no changes happen in the collections/tables for a long time, the connector might not receive any activity corresponding to the subscribed collections/tables. In case of MongoDB, that might lead to losing the token and in case of PostgreSQL, it might lead to the replication slot getting bigger (if there are changes happening to other non-subscribed tables/databases in the cluster). Now, as far as I understand, MySQL Debezium connector (or any CDC connector) reads the binlog files, filters for the records pertaining to the subscribed table and writes those records to, say, Kafka. MySQL doesn't notify the client (in this case the connector) of changes to the subscribed tables. So the connector shouldn't need a heartbeat. Even if there's no activity in the table, the connector should still read the binlog files, find that there's no activity, write nothing to Kafka and commit till when it has read. Why is the heartbeat mechanism required for MySQL CDC connectors? I am sure there is a gap in my understanding of how MySQL CDC connectors work. It would be great if someone could point out what I am missing. Thanks for reading.",

In reality, they’re just paying for an expensive Microsoft license to make alterations to a cloud-based semantic model that really just abstracts the data of their source system. My position is that it seems like an anti-pattern to expect your OLAP environment to influence your OLTP environment rather than the other way around. Someone else suggested changing the CRM system and got very little upvotes. I think data engineering is still going to be lucrative in 10 years because businesses will need people to unfuck everything when Microsoft is bleeding them dry after selling them all these point and click “solutions” that aren’t scalable and locks them into their Microsoft licensing. There’s going to be an inflection point where it just makes more economic sense to set up a Postgres database and an API and make reports with a python-based visualization library.",

So I have been working as SQL Server Dba for last 2 years for a service based company and I am currently part of the dba team which caters to atleast 8-10 clients simultaneously. Most of my work is monitoring work with ocassional high level stuff, otherwise most of the time I get like L1 level tasks. Since we cater to multiple clients therefore I had the opportunity to get in touch with other databases like MySQL and Oracle. I also work in AWS cloud, mainly we work with RDS, S3 for backups and EC2 instances where DB instances are installed. We work in rotational shifts which is the least favorite part of the job me. I got DBA role as a chance to enter to corporate and specially the data field, but I really don't like the DBA role, because I have seen the kind of time this role demands from you. I have seen my manager even working weekends sometimes due to some client activity or doing some POC for potential client. Plus the rotational shift I just hate it, I have endured for 2 years but I don't think so I will be able to endure for another year or two. I have been working remotely for last 2 years Therefore I had plenty of time to upskill myself and learn technologies like SQL Server, AWS Cloud (Mainly Database related tasks), L1 administration of MySQL and Oracle. Apart from that I have also invested time in learning Python which I like a lot, I had also invested a lot time in learning SQL too. Earlier I was learning web dev along job thinking that I could transition from DBA to dev, but I realised that both are very different roles and whatever I have learnt here as a DBA won't do me that good in dev role. Therefor I have decided to further transition into DE role. I have made a plan of the things that I will have to learn for DE role and also a plan to double down on things I already know. Mostly I want to focus on Azure ecosystem for DE and for That I have decided to learn SQL, Azure Data Factory - ADF - ETL, Databricks, Python, Spark - PySpark, Azure Synapse Analytics. I am already familiar with SQL and Python as mentioned before, and just need to take care of the other things. I just want to know from you guys is this even possible? Or am I just stuck with DBA role forever? Is my plan even relevant and doable or not? I have come to hate rotational shift and specially the night shifts so much that made my hate for DBA role even more greater. I am just looking for opinions, what do you guys think?Azure Devops",

        "content": "So MQTT and AMQP seems to be low latency pub sub protocol for IOT.But then NATS came out and it seems like it’s the same thing, but people seems to say it’s better.And we often see event streaming bus compare to those technology also like Kafka, pulsar or Redpanda. So I’m confused on what they are and when should we use them. Let’s only consider “new” scenario. Like would you still use MQTT? Or switch over to NATS directly if you were staring from scratch?And then cool that it’s better but why ? Can anyone tell me some use cases for each of them and/or how they can be used or combined to solve an issue ?",

It has around 3 GB, and using `file database.db` indicates that it has around \\~533k rows and \\~433M columns.I'm helping support perform this migration but we can't open this database. My work notebook has 32 GB of RAM and I get a `MemoryError` when I use the following: import scipy.io data = scipy.io.loadmat(\"database.db\")I've tried spinning up a VM in GCP with 64 GB of RAM but I got the same error. I used a `c4-highmem-8`, if I recall correctly.Our current last resort is to try to use a beefier VM in DigitalOcean, we requested a bigger quota last Friday.This has to be done by Tuesday, and if we don't manage to export all these tables then we'll have to manually download them one by one.I appreciate all the help!",

He wasn't too specific when describing it to me.I’m comfortable with basic Python, but still learning most of the other tools. This past week I’ve been self-studying Bash, but haven't really touched on the rest of the technologies he said I might use. I have \\~2 weeks until my start and \\~2 hours maybe more each day to learn.If anyone has experience with internships like this, I’d love advice on:* What kind of tasks I should expect as a junior/HS-level intern in DevOps/Data Science. Also not really sure how experienced they think I am lol * Are they expecting me to learn these technologies beforehand like I am doing?* What skills should I absolutely know vs. what I can learn on the fly* How to make a good impression when I’m a *lot* less experienced than everyone else* How to ask for help without sounding incompetent or annoying them* Any specific prep/resources you recommend in the next couple weeks* Etiquette in generalAppreciate any advice.

        "content": "Hi Folks,Need some advice on below process. Wanted to know if anybody has encountered this weird behaviour snowflake.Scenario 1 :- The Kafka Streamwe have a kafka stream running on a snowflake permanent table, which runs a put command to upload the csv files to table stage and then runs a copy command which unloads the data into the table. And then a RM command to remove the files from table stage.order of execution :- PUT to table\\_1 stage >> copy to table\\_1 >> RM to remove table\\_1 stage file.All the above mentioned steps are handled by kafka of course :)And as expected this runs fine, no rows missed during the process. Scenario 2:- The batch loadSometimes we need to do i batch load onto the same table, just in case of the kafka stream failure.we have a custom application to select and send out the batch file for loading. But below is the over all process via our custom application.Put file to snowflake named stage >> copy command to unload the file to table\\_1.Note :- in our scenario we want to load batch data into the same table where the kafka stream is running. This batch load process only works fine when the kafka stream is turned off on the table. All the rows from the files gets loaded fine.But here is the catch, once the kafka stream is turned on the table, if we try to load the batch file it doesnt just load at all.I have checked the query history and copy history.And found out another weird behaviour. It says the copy command has been run successfully and loaded around 1800 records into the table. But the file that we had uploaded had 57k. Even though it says it had loaded 1800 rows, those rows are nowhere to be found in the table. Has anyone encountered this issue? I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal. But i dont understand this behaviour of snowflake. Couldn't find anything on the documentation either.",

What I was expecting is to have a single Unique Id, update in place, then use Time Travel to toggle between versions. The only way I can do this, is check if the Id exists, and if it does do a simple Update statement, then have follow up query to do the insert of fresh rows. Which puts this on the Application code.Perhaps I am missing something conceptually with table formats/parquet files, or maybe Ducklake is missing key functionality (primary key constraints), I see Hudi has primary key support.

Over time, I’ve built some real-time streaming projects on my own, mostly to deepen my understanding and explore beyond my day-to-day work.Last year, I gave several interviews, most of which were in companies working in the same domain I was already in. I was hoping to break into a role that would let me explore something *different*, learn new technologies, and grow beyond the scope I’ve been limited to.Eventually, I joined a startup hoping that it would give me that kind of exposure. But, strangely enough, they’re also working in the same domain I’ve been trying to move away from, and the kind of work I was hoping for just isn’t there. There aren’t many interesting or challenging projects, and it’s honestly been stalling my learning.A few companies did shortlist my profile, but during the interviews, hiring managers mentioned that my profile lacks some of the *latest* skills, even though I’ve already worked on many of those in personal projects. It’s been a bit frustrating because I do have the knowledge, just not formal work experience in some of those areas.Now I find myself feeling kind of stuck. I’m applying to other companies again, but I’m not getting any response. At the same time, I feel distracted and not sure how to steer things in the right direction anymore.",

Our core stack includes MinIO, Apache Spark, probably Trino, some Scheduler for backend/compute as well as Jupyter + some web based SQL UI as front ends.Here’s where I’m hitting a roadblock: table management, especially as we scale. We're expecting a ton of Delta tables, and I'm unsure how best to track where each table lives and whether it's in Hive, Delta, or Iceberg format.I was thinking of introducing Hive Metastore (HMS) as a central point of truth for all table definitions, so both analysts and data engineers can rely on it when interacting with Spark. But honestly, the HMS documentation feels pretty thin, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something—or maybe even looking at the wrong solution altogether.Questions for the community:- How do you manage table definitions and data location metadata in your stack?- If you’re using Hive Metastore, how do you handle IAM and access control?Would really appreciate your insights or battle-tested setups!",

(this course is with a third party [not a vendor] that I won't name).All of my courses have sandbox environments that can be run in GitHub CodeSpaces, infra is open source, and uses a public gov dataset. For this I'm planning on having the following:- Postgres Database- pgAdmin for SQL IDE- A very simple typescript frontend app to surface data- A very simple user login workflow for CRUD data- A data catalog via DataHubWe will have a working data product as well as create data by going through the login workflow a couple times. We will then intentionally break it (update the data to be bad, change the login data collected without changing schema, and changing the DDL files to introduce errors). These errors will be hidden from the user, but they will see a bunch of errors in the logs and frontend.From there we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the issues. Examples of ways we will resolve issues is the following:- Revert back changes to the frontend- Add regex validation for login workflow- Review and fix introduced bugs in the DDL files- Implement DQ checks to run in CI/CD that compares proposed schema changes to expected schema in data catalogAnything you would add or change to this plan? Note that I already have a DQ for analytical databases course that this builds on.My goal is less teaching theory, and more so creating a real-world experience that matches what the job is actually like.",

Sorry for the confusion.Additionally, what I meant is to store all the excel data into SQL Server(we already have a DB) using SSMS.

Their only task should be to pass API keys to the correct ETL script and hit run. For example, [`zendesk.py`](http://zendesk.py) moves Zendesk data around. This is the level I’m dealing with.I’m looking for a platform (similar in spirit to Airflow) that can:* Show which ETL scripts are running* Display logs of each run* Show status (success, failure, progress)* Allow them to input different clients’ API keys easilyI’ve tried n8n but not sure if it’s easy enough for them. Airflow is definitely too heavy here.Is there something that would fit this workflow?Thank you in advance.",

Whatever your decision is, you should be able to justify it.---### I got my feedback!Two days ago, I hopped on a call with two senior devs in the company. They told me that they designed the test to find people that \"fit their spirit\", so that, \"if we go into a project on day two, everyone has the same mentality\".Problems they named and reasons they gave:- I didn't generate my controllers with the open-api spec.- I didn't explain __why__ I implemented the `CreditStoreService#transaction` method the way I did.- My tests are not connected to the open-api spec.- My tests use `@Order`-Annotations.As I explained my reasoning for these deliberate decisions, they listened to me and told me my motives were valid. They just do it another way. As I then said that it's impossible to get these criteria right because they are not a part of the task, they said that they hope for a candidate who is \"a lucky hit\".The rest of the meeting was just an awkward talk, where we all came to the conclusion that this is not a good criterion for hiring, they agreed, but said the decision was already made. :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone:",

So many properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, mixins, parameters, and I’m like:\"Wait… what do I actually need to look at right now?\"I often just search for what I need in the moment, but then I get this weird FOMO (fear of missing out), like maybe I’m ignoring something really useful that I’ll need later.At the same time, reading everything seems impossible and draining.So I wanted to ask:How do you personally approach big documentation pages?Do you just read what’s relevant now?Do you take time to explore what else a class can do, even if you don’t need it yet?And if yes, how do you remember or organize what you saw for later?I guess I just feel like I should \"know everything\" and that pressure gets overwhelming. Would love to hear how others deal with this — especially devs who’ve been doing this for a while.Thanks",

        "author": "W_lFF",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I was also guilty of this when I started 3 years ago. I wanted to learn everything, because everything seemed so cool. My main goal was Backend development but I ended up starting courses on Kotlin, Go, Rust, Java, Python and Lua. I didn't see these languages as tools but as personalities, and that's a big mistake I made aswell as a lot of other beginners. Very often I'd find myself asking questions like \"How many languages should I learn?\", \"Is Java, JavaScript and Python a good stack for backend development?\", but I'd still be learning JS arrays in codecademy with only 3 projects in my directory.The answer to all those questions, in my opinion is, it does not matter. Programming != coding, so it doesn't matter how many languages you learn, the thing you should be mainly focused is learning how to solve problems using the syntax. Learn to solve problems with what you have, THAT is the important piece in my opinion.Why I think it's important that many beginners grow out of this phase ASAP: 1. When you start to view languages as what they are, you start to appreciate more what you use. In my case, I don't find JavaScript to be the most charming language, but I love it's rich ecosystem and the fact that I can use it for pretty much anything I want to do. 2. You risk burning yourself out. This was me three years ago. I had 5 courses on different languages and it polluted my mind with information that I KNEW deep down was completely useless to me in the long run. You could argue that I was getting to see new paradigms and techniques to solving problems, but that wasn't even true. I never made it far enough into ANY course to learn anything that I hadn't seen in JavaScript. It was a waste of time and it lead to me burning out and losing interest, until recently that I finally got back into programming. 3. You stop thinking and you start doing. When I finally got back into coding recently with better learning habits I started learning and creating projects faster than ever before. Because I wasn't focused on \"Hmmm, maybe I should try out Scala!\", no I was focused on \"What other Data Structures should I learn to implement?\", \"How do I solve this bug?\", \"What should be my next project?\". When you start seeing languages as tools, you'll want to use those tools.In conclusion, this is not to say that you shouldn't be curious and you shouldn't ask questions and you shouldn't experiment and you should just stick to one thing and never explore. What I'm trying to say is that, a lot of the time, beginners are so excited to learn that they forget WHY they're learning. Which is to get a job, to be successful, to create something meaningful, to be good at a hobby, etc.. And I feel like if you don't focus on creating and learning and solving, and you're always thinking about what's the future and not the present, then you'll just risk burning yourself out. There are tons of roadmaps out there for whatever you want to build, stick with it or tweak it a little along the way. But don't start a course on Python today and then tomorrow it's SQL and then the next day is HTML and CSS, no. Stick to what you want to do, once you understand the core concepts and programming as a whole, everything else will follow and everything after that will be easier to learn.",

I have a lot of knowledge when it comes to web, game and software development but not enough work officially done yet to prove that I do. I’ve at least have a part time job in the it industry already but I feel like I still have to show much more than work. It’s the same way I feel about my academics.My biggest goal has always been to expand my portfolio especially during the summer. And at first while classes were technically over in highschool, I was first being productive towards my goal spending everyday coding this one project. I later became tired and fed up with my process that I moved onto another as a break of sorts. Then another. And another. And at this point, I haven’t coded in a while in two weeks or done anything productive. I’ve really just been getting into crochet to take off the pressure about contractual stuff and just focus on something else for the time being like making a sweater I saw from Pinterest for instance..I have about three projects which are unfinished and I promised myself especially about the portfolio website that I will finish it because I have been working on that since last December. Then again the reason why it took awhile was because of I was trying to figure out and decide what the UI would look just to avoid large frontend revisions. Anyways, any advice for managing projects? I really want to be able to finish these independently and especially at least one of these within the end of the summer.",

Started with editing (see: copying code into and altering) a 3D character controller state machine for godot, was pretty proud that I got it so that the player couldn't uncrouch underneath something and adapted someone else's code to make a leaning system. Realized the 3D game idea was way way too outside of my skill set so I downgraded to 2D, worked on that a bit, got caught up making screenshot mockups cause I'm an artist, barely really coded anything but figured that this was still too hard for me probably. Tried making pong. Too hard. Finally I just ate my pride and said I'd shed the need of trying to learn to program and learn a game engine at the same time and now I'm making a text adventure game in python.The reason I had my first win is cause I've had such a hard time coding anything by myself. I've always needed a tutorial and never come up with solutions on my own. I needed a bit of help to get this project rolling but overall but now I'm able to open up VS Code and work alone with googling and documentation reading. I made a really basic save system on my own! Came up with the problem, thought about it, and came to a solution on my own! It's far from robust or complex, there are probably a million better ways to do this but I did it by myself and I'd say it's reasonably complex considering I was having troubles coding a 2D character controller on my own.I've got a long way to go but I think this is a good ass win.

The courses are very well put together and really make it easy and approachable to pick up and learn the foundational material. The community is exceptionally helpful, the AI tool for education theyve employed is very good at \"teaching\" you concepts without just flat providing the answers (very different from what the other AIs out there do), and you do feel as though you are progressing and learning as you go up in the subject matter.>**THE GRIPE** *i say this as someone who did NOT have a coding background*As you move along through the courses, especially once you hit the PyGame / Object Oriented Programming / Functional Programming areas, you will start to hit \"concept walls\" where you can't complete the answer just based on the information that's been previously provided. I've hit many moments, where feeling completely stumped on a lesson, that the core solve for it came from an understanding that was not reviewed in the previous \"internal\" materials, but existed as something that would have been \"understood\" if the user had some comp sci / programming background. It's just very frustrating at times to feel as though you've been paying attention to the materials and following along, only to suddenly hit a wall of knowledge and discover, \\[ no its designed to not be informed, so you have an urge to go out and find what you dont know \\]. Personally, if I'm paying for a service, I want the knowledge to be provided for learning, not that I have to go out externally elsewhere and hopefully discover it. >**THE WARNING**Content will become SIGNIFICANTLY harder as you progress. The Discord is there and does help a lot in answer basic questions, and some more advanced ones; but it does genuinely feel as though the course materials are being written more for people who are already have familiarity with Comp Sci / Programming, **ie the core basics**, and then the later courses are meant to build on top of that wider external schooling and knowledge. Those that are there to assist, again all well meaning and wanting to be helpful, advise on how to solve for it as if they were speaking to other programmers who also are familiar with the code youre having trouble with. Like hearing 2 experts talk to each other trying to solve a problem, if youre not on the same level knowledge wise, it becomes more difficult to follow along on what theyre trying to advise on how to correct for. >**FINAL THOUGHTS**The service provided is INCREDIBLY well worth the cost... to a point depending on where you're starting from. If you have some code formal training / teaching, it probably is easier to follow along, but its openly stated that there is a teaching approach of not providing all the resources / guideposts for you to follow, and that you should go beyond the platform to find some answers.**For me, I have issue with that approach as a service I'm paying for to learn a subject matter on** *but again, thats uniquely to me*I just want to share this to both promote the service, as I have been able to write functional python blurbs for solving my own small scale ideas and puzzles; but also as a warning that its VERY unlikely you can go into this, completely cold fresh and blind, and come out within 1 year as a trained backend dev with the full experience. I'll most likely renew my yearly membership for the platform, but there are hurdles that I now have to figure out the best way to learn-around instead of just beating my face into the wall as I have been for some problems.",

When I joined my current company I was actually hoping to get to be more hands on again, but the reality was my role didn't call for it... until now. Our new CTO wants dev managers to be more \"player coaches\". So I am actually pretty keen about learning my stack which is primarily node.js, react and postgres based and API standards are important.So my question is how best to efficiently learn the stack in 2025. I will need to learn syntax, and I will need to learn mechanisms that I have not worked with before, eg: promises - as asynchronous programming was not prevalent when I was a programmer. Back in the day, I learned very well reading good books - I remember a book about Java by Ivor Horton from WROX that I read back to front in a matter of days. But I wouldn't say all books were of that level. I even read all the IBM books on DB2 to learn the product and become strong on databases.Over the years I have dabbled with Udemy courses, but I find them far too inefficient to consume in video format in comparison to reading. I did learn some concepts in React and Typescript syntax, but I never completed the courses because frankly they wouldn't have benefited my role at the time and I haven't really coded for fun in some time.I also tried an ACM membership where I got access to some Safari books as well as well as Pluralsight courses which were better I found than Udemy - but lacked much one the node.js front (perhaps limited by the ACM offering). The Safari books were ok, but not necessarily that well written.I'm looking for what is likely to be the best path forward for me. Appreciate any tips you can offer.",

        "content": "Now, I've been working on JS pretty much since I started coding 3 years ago, and I really like the C-style syntax. The curly braces especially, semicolons make so much sense and when looking at Python code snippets it just looks so unnatural. Yet so many people SWEAR by how enjoyable it is to use. So, I want to ask, is it really?Python does look easy, but the indentation makes no sense to me and it honestly makes code more difficult to follow for me. I have no experience in Python so I may be VERY wrong. But personally, even though I can understand Python code to a good extent, the indentation just throws me off and makes reading nested code a HEADACHE for me because I have to take a hot second on each line to see where the indentation begins and ends. Now, this could all be because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but isn't the whole point of Python to be easy to read and understand? It is easy to read, I understand most code snippets out there, but the whole indentation thing is just so confusing to me. Is this a normal thing to say? Am I going crazy for questioning Python's readability? I'll still learn it some day, but I just wanted to ask whether anybody has ever felt this way and how they overcame it, because I don't want to get a headache every time I create an API.",

Hopefully) has been pushing me to go towards a career i've always had dabbled with in my free time.I'm just in need for some advice on my best route possible. I've played around with TrueNAS, linux, and Docker before and i am well aware that these are just trivial things and in no way a reflection as to how difficult coding truly is.What i'd like to ask the community is: What is some advice anyone in the industry could lend me? Should I go to uni and take night classes? Would online certificates land me a good job? If so where should i take them?I've also been very interested in [Boot.Dev](http://Boot.Dev) Has anyone been able to land a job with the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) program? if not and i were to sign up for their program, would i be wasting my money by signing up for another online school to pass their accredited courses?The reason i'm so interested in [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) is i have ADHD and i never knew about it until my 4th year of trade school. I always had issues with learning by reading. but with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) making it into a game i truly think i could pick up the basics through them.Anyways, I apologized for ranting. if anyone could lend this old man some knowledge i would be forever indebted!Thanks!!",

That's (more or less) why we have the very popular rule of thumb in Python: multithreading for I/O-bound work, multiprocessing for CPU-bound work.Also thank you to u/HQMorganstern for the more detailed explanation",

        "content": "I’ve been watching Fireship since 2021, and I’ve always loved his content. It’s super educational, helpful, and at the same time funny and really engaging. I used to look forward to every upload, it felt like a little event each time. Watching the channel grow over the years and gain millions of subscribers has been awesome.Lately though, I’ve noticed that most of the content has been focused on AI, especially in the Code Report series. I totally understand why AI is huge right now, and those videos are pulling crazy numbers. But I kind of miss his older content, like the classic “100 Seconds of (Tech)” videos, the JavaScript survival guide, or Web Dev 101. That kind of content was gold, especially for new and intermediate devs or engineers trying to get a solid grip on different technologies quickly.It does seem like Fireship is aware of this he even mentioned in the recent MCP tutorial video that it’s still a tutorial channel. So it’s nice to see that acknowledgment. And to be fair, even his newer videos still have that signature humor and creativity that made his channel stand out in the first place.Overall, I still really enjoy his channel and respect what he’s doing. It’s been a valuable resource for a lot of programmers, developers, engineers. Fireship has played a big role in making learning tech feel less intimidating and more fun, and that’s something I’ll always appreciate.",

I’m new to programming, have been dabbling for a couple months now and I recently started CS50 which so far has been great in helping build a more conceptual understanding of cs.However, I’ve been really struggling for the past two days. I get crazy brain fog while I’m watching the lecture (my digestion has been off lately so it might be a factor) which makes it nearly impossible to digest—no pun intended—some concepts from the course, such as functions and loops. It’s very hard not to let this obstacle convince me that coding is just not for me, but I can’t deny how this brain fog makes it extremely hard to focus and have mental clarity. As a side note, I’m also navigating a difficult situation in life and it’s bringing a lot of stress and frustration. Has anyone ever dealt with that? Any advice? How not to let this issue discourage you from continuing to learn… I’ve got a personal project I really want to work on, and the last thing I want to hear is that I won’t be able to make it :pensive_face:",

I used AI to help generate and structure some of the flashcards, but I made sure to review and refine everything by hand so it’s actually useful and not just noisy.There’s also a blog section — I’ll be honest, part of the reason I added it was to help grow the site a bit and make it more friendly for things like AdSense. But I’ve tried to make sure the posts are genuinely helpful, not just filler.Anyway, it’s still a work in progress, but if you give it a try I’d love to know what you think or what’s missing. Happy to improve it based on real feedback.It's available in both polish and english, however as most programming is done in english -> even for polish native I suggest you to use english version.Thanks!",

        "author": "AxelsOG",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I started up on learning Python again and have made more progress than previous attempts and I'm starting to enjoy it a bit more now. But I've started by using Grok simply as a baseline starting point because I've always had trouble \"just learning\" and if I have no structure it tends to be difficult. I understand its probably not great long term, but I'm just simply using it to guide, but I'm also relying on other documentation and other sources online beyond a baseline \"Try and do this, maybe try and implement this and go in this general direction\"But anyway, the suggestion it gave me was a program that checks whether a number is odd or even. My first iteration was made because I didn't read what it was supposed to be and ended up making a program that had a list of preset numbers, picked a random number from that list and checked if it was even or odd.Since I realized that wasn't what I was 'supposed' to do, I actually realized what I should have done and made this.What it's intended to do is request a valid positive integer, and check if its even or odd. It ignores any negative integers, any numbers 'too larger' (which I added simply to continue learning new stuff), and anything that isn't a number.It also gives you 3 tries to input a valid integer before closing after too many tries. I also made it so the \"attempts remaining\" will either say \"attempts\" or \"attempt\" based on whether you have multiple attempts left, or only 1 attempt remaining.And this works exactly as intended on the user side. I may be overthinking this, but I was wondering if there was a way to optimize it or make it more 'efficient' when checking if the number is less than 0 or if the number is too large. Even though it works exactly as intended, I was wondering if this code was 'bad' even though it works. I don't want to develop any bad coding habits or make things longer/harder than they need to be. from time import sleep max_attempts = 3 #Total attempts allowed. attempts = 0 #Attempt starting value. number = None print('This program checks if a number is even or odd.') #Welcomes the user. while attempts < max_attempts:     try:         number = int(input('Enter a valid non-negative integer: '))         if number < 0:             attempts += 1             remaining = max_attempts-attempts ##Defines remaining as maximum attempts minus wrong attempts             if attempts < max_attempts:                 print(f\"Invalid input!

It was the most complex thing I have worked on as a beginner and learner.I lost confidence after pausing for 8 months after starting everything from scratch. It was hard to restart. So I picked up the challenge to learn by doing. And I kid you not I did what I could not have if I did things normally. I encourage everyone reading this to go out and fail, to be in a situation where you scratch your head. That is what growth looks like. Tutorials are equivalent to stories of warriors, and you could hope to become one only when you place your foot on the battlefield.You can check it out if you want to on my profile!Thanks!",

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice? Anybody who is/was in a similar situation who wants to share?",

I am currently enrolled in option 2 but I know it is going to be a struggle. I’m wondering if I should try to teach myself python basics before I get to school so I have a chance at passing (reviews mentioned the level of coding involved is not actually appropriate for an intro level class, and only students with previous experience were able to do well) or see if I can ask an advisor about finding an approved alternative course. Luckily my dad knows python so I can ask him for help on assignments and stuff so I won’t be completely lost if this class is my only option. What should I do?

When we ask for more definition, they say, “We’re agile, we don’t define things upfront.” Topic owners exist, but they’re not software engineers and handle this work on the side.I’ve tried to bring structure (requirements engineering, estimations, etc.), but that work isn’t recognized or factored into planning. Only visible UI changes seem to matter. One colleague quit over this, others have told me to consider leaving.

The program would also read the file and even re-write it, and the data would be ordered by the time when it was calculated.As I believe to understand, fstream read functions don't load the whole file into the ram, but if I want to remove parts and move everything back to \"fill in\" the space, it could lead to having to move very large amounts of data. With separated files, that work would be reduced, specially if I put a header in the files that tells the \"Creation time\" of the data inside, allowing the program to quickly detect the file in which the data that it's looking for is stored.My question is, at which size does it tend to be better to create a new file for the program to access? Would this even be the best way to implement what i want?Thank you",

Now a days every role seems like unstable, roles are getting merged or eliminated, you cannot plan your career anymore. You cannot decide if I do X, Y, Z there is a high probability I will land P, Q or R. By the time you graduate P, Q, R roles may not even exist in the same shape anymore. You are trying to catch a moving target, it is super frustrating.Not only that you cannot build specialized expertise in a technology, it may get automated or outsourced or replaced by a newer technology.

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Let me start by saying I’m (early career) a year into this corporate job at a \"billion-dollar\" multinational company. I fully understand that any work I do while employed is legally the company's intellectual property. That said, this post is more about how I can take advantage of my contributions for my career rather than being brushed aside.A couple of weeks ago, I made an earlier post about a similar situation, but at a smaller scale. Since then, things have escalated quickly, and I feel the new developments warrant a separate post.Long story short, I modernized an outdated system with great success for our region. It gained a lot of traction so much so that a team from another region requested I build the same system for them, tailored to their needs.Now here’s where the new developments start. Apparently, while all this was happening, someone higher up at the global level got access to my project and showed it to their boss who is just one level below the CEO. I still have no idea who this person is or how they even gained access to my work. Anyways, this corporate leader was so impressed that they decided the system should be rolled out globally as soon as possible. The person who shared my project then took it upon themselves to assign a team dedicated to replicating it for all regions.Now this assigned team somehow managed to access my project (I genuinely suspect a security breach or admin-level involvement) and tried to reverse-engineer everything I built.. but failed. They then began trying to identify who was behind the project and eventually contacted my manager (the \"official\" project manager) by pulling him into a meeting without prior notice. Odd.So my manager then decided to setup a proper call with this team with me involved this time. In this call, they basically came forward and requested us to provide all the code, tools, and infrastructure so they can simply copy and paste it for all regions, as well as requesting several technical sessions. To make matters worse, they want me to handle all the IT bureaucratic processes for every region to get things set up. I can already see myself being roped into supporting all regions and not just my own at this point. Not only that, but I believe this \"replication\" approach will be destined to fail as each region has different user requirements and processes not quite comparable to ours. And I also strongly believe they will struggle to get anything running, due to their limited technical and business knowledge of the processes, and the type of technical questions I was being asked. Nevertheless, if this team rolls out my solution globally for each region, they’ll receive all the visibility and credit (they'll be hosting demo sessions with region leaders which for sure I wont be invited to), while I'll be essentially cast into the shadows. What’s frustrating is that I have full knowledge of the system and am responsible for it so why isn't my manager at least being the one leading this global rollout and not some random team?I’ve been trying to indirectly nudge my manager to take ownership of the global initiative, instead of letting this new team take over. But I’m not sure how this will play out. The person who assigned this team is closer to the corporate leader, while my manager is a few steps lower in the hierarchy. So far, all he’s done is try to keep our regional manager informed of the situation playing out. Realistically, only the regional manager can mention this to the corporate leader, but I’m not confident that will happen.My manager often says \"how will this benefit the team?\" But in this case, it’s clear he’s struggling to see any benefit in simply handing over our work to another team that will walk away with all the credit.We’re still in the early stages, and I haven’t handed anything over yet. But I’m deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. From a career perspective, it looks like I'm gaining nothing from this besides telling myself I did the work. Being so early in my career, a project like this would really benefit me tenfold. I really don't want to waste this chance to turn this into something beneficial.&nbsp;EDIT: Thank you to everyone who shared their perspective. I recognize that my tone reflected more negativity than I aim to carry as a person. I allowed ego to slip in due to the project's success. Moving forward, I’ll focus on assuming positive intent and professionally advocating for myself when possible as that is the only thing I truly have control over.",

Especially because the job was in-person and paid something like 50k, which is not much for Boston.I work in economics, so I'm curious to see if this experience is representative of the field overall right now and what that might signal for the trajectory of the economy. From browsing this subreddit, it does seem like there's a lot of lamenting the state of the job market, but I'd be curious to hear insiders' perspectives.For anyone involved in hiring, are you seeing similar levels of competition? If so, is this a recent occurrence or has it been ongoing for a while? Is the current hiring environment similar to previous periods you've experienced (the Dot-com bubble, the GFC, etc.)?",

        "content": "~4 YOE. Took up a new job for a new change of pace. I did screw myself because this new role wasn't paying that much more than my previous role and the commute was significantly worse, but I was already sort of burned out by my old place so I thought anything would be a nice change of pace.Fast forward one and half weeks in. A few things struck to me as red flags -* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.There might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.After spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.I was given a warning for using my phone for \"non-productive reasons\" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours. This was followed by another warning from another member of management. Essentially two people. (With heavy irony that the person giving me the warning was also on his phone in between waiting for things to load.)Followed by a e-mail where the entire team was CC'ed, singling me out that I did not fall into their expectations for focus and productivity with possible escalation to the CEO.Consider this a vent or a plead for affirmation, but was it just me or did this behaviour come across as total overreach? Either way, I've decided that my way of working is clearly not aligned with the company's expectations and I immediately resigned on the spot. Yes, I know that the market is bad and this may have been an overreaction on my part, but would anyone of you have done the same?",

After about 6–9 years in this role, is there really anywhere to go?Let’s be real — it’s a simple job. You build screens, hook up APIs, and maybe add some animations or state handling here and there. But when it comes to core business logic, anything that actually requires deeper system thinking or architectural decisions — all of that is almost always at the backend (for good reasons).And honestly, most app devs I’ve worked with don’t even try to go beyond that. Very little interest in performance optimization, state management patterns, or even understanding what happens behind the API. It’s mostly a UI plumbing job.So I’m wondering — is this it? Do people just keep doing the same thing for 10–15 years until they’re replaced by younger devs who can do the same job for cheaper? Or is there a natural transition path (into BE, product, or something else) that actually makes sense?Would love to hear from others who’ve been in the app dev track longer or made a pivot.",

        "content": "**Intro.**I wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.**Story time.**At first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.Over the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.After five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.I feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.**Where I applied.**About 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.**The numbers.**Now for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).**Advice.**Over the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a \"Skills\" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.Don't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.I spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Overview**About 7 months ago, I got a job as a software engineer at a great company straight out of college. For the most part, I like my job. I really can't complain, but I just wanted to get other people's perspective. **Context**I went to school for programming because I loved it. My passion was mainly in embedded systems. During college, I was lucky enough to get a position as a research engineer on a research program, and got to write the firmware for a very small satellite. I truly loved it. During this period, I submitted hundreds of job applications that went nowhere. I ended up getting my current job from a connection I made during college.Don't get me wrong, I like my current job. I am not complaining in the slightest, I fully understand how lucky and privileged I am to be in my current position, and I don't take that for granted. I went through the job struggle like many others have. I even followed this sub, and almost lost hope because of it :( **Question**In my current position, I write Python microservices for a very large company. It can be interesting. Most importantly though, I couldn't be happier with my coworkers. They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them. However, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. That being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore. **Conclusion**Again, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want* to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week. **TLDR**Got a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad. What do other SWE's do about this?",

Technically, I’ve been eligible to graduate for the past year, but I’ve been deliberately delaying it to continue doing internships and gain experience while at the same time applying for full-time jobs. My plan was always to hit the graduation button the moment something landed.So far, I’ve racked up **28 months of internship experience**, mostly including software and hardware development at places like Dell Technologies and a space agency. And yet, I’m still struggling to land a full-time role, let alone an interview.The job market here in Vancouver (and across Canada) has been... bleak. I’ll admit I’ve been picky, wanting to stay in here, but it's been *REALLY* tough. I’m feeling incredibly stuck and unsure of how to move forward.I have some options that I'm considering, but I just don't know which move is best1. Delay graduation again to do an Undergraduate Thesis in Robotics, hopefully to fluff my GPA a bit and make me more competitive for grad school. Problem is, though I have considered a master's program, I don't even know what I'd want that to be in.2. Graduate in August and spend day and *night* applying for jobs. Figure out a grad school to go to later and hope my CV is good enough to get in. Maybe do an accounting diploma in the evenings as a back-up (I've heard the memes, I did have a friend successfully land a job after a year of their diploma though)3. Go into Electrical trades (my friend spent 8 months looking for work and started doing this when he couldn't find anything).4. Join the Air ForceFor those in similar shoes, what did you do? Would love to hear if anyone’s been in a similar situation or has insight from the other side.",

I couldn't find anything in this area, so I started looking at remote jobs, and it seems like anything that I'm remotely qualified for is no longer accepting remote applications. For example, data engineering and data analytics roles. Most positions I keep seeing are in some metro area requiring relocation and not even tolerating any sort of remote applicant anymore. This is completely opposite to how it was when I entered the workforce in 2020. In 2020, people were excited to talk to me and reaching out all the time regardless of where I lived. Now they don't care what my qualifications are, how talented I am, what my skill set is. They just won't even consider me at all it's like they just close the door in a huff and cut off communications if I'm not directly in the local area. I can give you one example. Lowe's the hardware store. Back in 2021 they were trying to recruit me even though I wasn't in the area. I talked to the same recruiter again couple weeks ago, and she was very dismissive and condescending about me not wanting to relocate to Charlotte North Carolina, and was very adamant about the fact that I would have to drive outside of Charlotte about 20 mi north of the city to Morrisville where the job was located, which is honestly kind of stupid if you ask me? Why would I go and move to a big city right? And then live out in the middle of nowhere to commute to this weird corporate office. So I would basically be making my life worse and more costly",

Before this, I was working as a Full Stack Developer for the last 4 years at a very small company. The typical task at my last job was very simple CRUD work with business logic sprinkled in and our whole system ran fine on a medium EC2 instance. Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.While I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.We have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).What sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it? I feel like the last 4 years I've been playing little league and have only had to worry about such small things and picked up some bad habits, but now I'm in the big leagues and I feel so out of place.Thanks!",

I’m fine with the world of IT, but it’s not where I want to be in 5 years. This is my first real job — I’ve had 3 internships before this. I originally took the job because I was told I’d be doing development, but so far I’ve only done one project that sends out an email to my coworkers.I also hate my job and the people I work with. Every day feels like it could be my last. I’m surrounded by unrealistic expectations, humiliation rituals, and egos that don’t listen to reason. I’m coming up with a plan to leave because I don’t see how this job is helping my career as a software dev. To make things worse, I’ve become rusty because I haven’t coded in about a year.Here’s my plan for the next 3–6 months to get back on track and be as employable as possible:* Grind LeetCode’s **Blind 75**, with extra focus on arrays* Use ChatGPT to simulate behavioral interviews* Read and take notes on **Cracking the Coding Interview*** Clean up my GitHub and add projects + Blind 75 solutionsI also want to show some solid projects on GitHub to prove I know how to code. Any suggestions for projects that would stand out to employers?I’ve already started applying to jobs in hopes I find something marginally better, even while I’m rusty. I’m totally fine working in IT too — I just really want a remote job.Does this seem like a good plan? Any resources or changes that would be a better use of my time?",

It lasted from November 2023 to November 2024.I feel so lost. I really like coding and stuff but I have some issues:I suck with coming up with ideas for projects. I finally made one prototype app that uses sleepers api for fantasy football. It was built in python django since that is what my internship used, but remaking it in Java/Springboot since I prefer Java (https://mysleeperapi.com/). I also deployed it on my own too. It's not much, but it's kinda cool.Right now I have low motivation due to serious depression, and it's getting worse. I sit infront of my PC all day when not at my crappy data entry job. I have udemy courses that I try and follow, but even that is hard sometimes.I'm kinda older than the newer grad, I turn 29 on July 11th (so i was about to turn 27 when i graduated). I'm afraid that due to my age and lack of experience, I'll never get my foot in the door.I also have the issue on not knowing what I should do and with the current job market, it feels like I have to learn everything.Lastly I feel like my region sucks for tech jobs. I live in Northeast Ohio in the Cleveland area.My life feels so derailed, and of course I would graduate in 2023 when everything falls apart, and I can't image being a graduate in 2024 onward.If this is what I have to look forward to, I'd rather not be around because it's bullshit.

        "content": "Long story short, I landed an amazing job as a SWE. It's at a very well known FAANG+ company and the team is sort of new and we'll be working on some interesting problems. Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.Then there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).I never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.I realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.So, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated! **Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

The latest round is regarding how information is displayed, which no one else has had an issue with 6+ people, actively using the information given to debug every single issue we’ve had so far.

But I'm constantly getting negative vibes.* I'm forced to stay in one city while working, (even working remote).* Strict dress code rules including wearing suits. * I'm constantly facing too much security checks in my pc. * I face too much pressure about documenting every step (including creating hotfixes, commits etc.) and I need to write everything in depth. Too much regulations going on and I'm really bored because the code is terribly bad. I'm as if doing documentation rather than usual coding. Even though NO ONE HAS mentioned me how I should have done it. Even after 7 months...* Issues are getting bigger with each iteration. * I am constantly being micromanaged by my team leader and my manager and they warn me about every step. * I have to work after hours and even weekends if there's a problem, because obviously it is my fault. * I'm getting blamed because I opened too much \"hotfixes\" that my team lead wanted yet I'm to blame. * Team lead is always mocking my work and talking as if I'm a really bad developer. * No PR reviews and no testers resulting in prod problems, yet I'm to blame.* Bad coworkers and weird office environment. * I have to go on site everyday because of my bad performance* I also can't change my team because of bad performance...I'm not so sure anymore if it is either me that is the bad developer or I am not a cultural fit to the company. I am burnout and I don't want to work on a weekend because there's something broken. Also how come people are so terrible with not working on weekends? Don't you have life? Why should I care about the company even after hours, let me live my fcking life.",

        "content": "Hi folks. I need your advice. I'm a front-end developer, ux-designer and startup founder who wants to become a product manager. I'm struggling to decide how I want to sell myself during interviews and on my CV. These are the points I'm struggling with:* I'm introverted, love to listen and ask a lot of questions. I have the feeling PMs are expected to be extroverted and spew out energy - especially during an interview. Should I fake it? * If I don't know something I say it. I feel like these days everybody is looking for the perfect candidate. “You don't know x or y? Next!” At least this is how it goes for dev roles. Should I pretend to know everything and wing it? (this question applies to resumes, too) * I am humble and quite frankly I should be because neither have I founded a million dollar company nor worked in big tech yet. To me it seems like during the interview phase you have to present yourself like you are the big shit and exaggerate everything you have done. Because this is exactly what everybody else does. At least for dev roles there are programming tests that show real skills. Should I exaggerate my past successes?* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. To me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM “knows his stuff”? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? * I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobsTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems “real”. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? I hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub. If not, please excuse me. Thanks a lot.",

Recently I've been put in more of a leadership role where I have to manage delivery for a team of 5, now 8 as of this week, engineers and 3 QE.While I think I'm getting better at it, it also feels like there's never enough time to do all the things I need to do. I'm in meetings 6 hours a day, have to achieve increasingly difficult timelines, need to plan ahead for upcoming sprints and further on the roadmap, make sure capacity is being fully utilized, parallelize as much of the work as possible, help the developers grow, unblock them, provide technical leadership, accelerate them to meet deadlines, provide feedback to their managers, etc.Run on sentence is intended, but the main idea is that I'm overwhelmed with all that I'm responsible for. I have a project manager type person to support me, and recently we've had a more productive relationship in a way that they manage the backlog in Jira independently after we've scoped out the work and what can be done in parallel. They've started using ChatGPT to initially populate the details and we later review each of the stories when it's closer to the time someone needs to pickup the work. I have trouble gauging when my engineers are underperforming, or if I haven't provided enough support. I'm use to holding myself to my own standards, but I also feel like it's not fair to hold others to my own standards, because while they work for me and my personality, I feel like it's too high of a bar to force on others unless they opt in.I continually think about just leaving and being an IC somewhere else, but I also feel like 30 years from now I wont want to be an IC due to the changing landscape of the CS world.I think what I'm looking for is advice on how others manage it. It feels like as soon as I got good at the engineering part, I don't spend nearly as much time engineering. Managing other people in delivery feels like a different skillset than the one that I've been focusing on for most of my career.",

I don't feel like I grew as a developer for some of those years. I still feel like a junior dev sometimes. Mid-level at best. Most of my work has been very similar bug fixes and QOL upgrades. I have been gradually gaining trust to work on larger issues over the years though, especially recently. I've suggested and implemented some design changes for certain modules, but most were small changes. Recently, while working on some bug fixes, I realized that a certain system needs a pretty dramatic re-design, which I am currently working on. We also have a relatively new dev and since we've returned to office, I've kinda been her default mentor for showing her how some of our systems work. This led me to thinking that I may be closer for a senior position than I originally thought.I know my technical skills still need a lot of improving. I've gotten complacent only working with our outdated tech stack (and general practices if I'm being honest). I haven't done much outside learning/coding over the years, but I am currently re-learning React and I'm finally working on a personal project that isn't from tutorial hell.",

I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface, and yet I’m also falling behind on other big topics like AI, embedded systems, applications, back end dev, stuff like that.

However, my offer letter and onboarding portal were all for a Vancouver, BC role, even though I’m in the U.S. and have never held a Canadian status.Naturally, I got super confused because the onboarding materials all referenced Canadian work authorization, SIN numbers, and pathways for Canadian citizens, international students, etc. I emailed Amazon’s onboarding team asking for clarification, explaining that I’m a U.S. citizen with no Canadian status and no idea how to start the work permit process.I received a reply today and was told that I should have received a U.S. offer, not a Canadian one. Furthermore, the Vancouver offer is to be canceled, and a new U.S. offer was promised by “end of day.”However, it is now evening, and I still haven’t received the new offer.My original onboarding timeline mentioned a deadline of July 7th to accept the offer and complete a survey (which I completed, though with answers which apply to the Canada offer).The Vancouver offer has definitely been revoked, attempting to access the employment documents states that I do not have an account. Tomorrow is July 4th, then the weekend, and then July 7th is Monday. I’m scared some automated system might cancel my candidacy entirely if there’s no active offer in the system by the deadline.I’m not sure if there is anything I should do in the meantime. I have already replied to the email regarding the promised U.S. offer and am hesitant to contact further, given that I have already emailed 2x today. I just don’t want to let this slip through the cracks.Should I follow up again tomorrow or wait until Monday? Will Amazon’s systems actually auto-cancel an onboarding if there’s no active offer in place?Any advice is hugely appreciated. I'm just worried about getting lost in the system due to the timeline and offer error.",

I’ve been promoted twice and I have good reputation. I think it’s time to leave because: 1. Lowish salary for YOE 2. I feel I’ve learned most of what I’m going to learn from the stack used here 3. I’m scared of getting stuck here for the rest of my career 4. I’m not super confident in a recent reorg that we’ve hadSalary: 136k + Performance based bonus (~22k +/-)Hybrid 2 days a week with 9/80 schedule Company B: Tax consulting firm that isn’t a household name but has 10000+ employees globally (according to glassdoor). I had never heard of them until a recruiter reached out in LinkedIn. I went into the interview with the mindset of just shaking of the dust on my interview skills but I ended up liking the team and they liked me a lot too. I think the work should be a nice change of pace. My main concern is if this will look good in my resume in a few years when I’m ready to move on. Salary: 150k + Performance based bonus (up to 30%)Remote with occasional travel to a city that’s ~4 hours away. Part of my hesitation is how unknown of a firm Company B is. I went to a top 10 computer science school for undergrad and I know that got my foot in a lot of doors. Would moving to Company B moving away from opportunities like that? Or is it worth it to break away from being type casted as an O&G only SWE?",

I'm wondering if I need more time searching or if I am cooked only 1 internship and a 3.09 GPA. I am also wondering if anyone here has websites they reccomend or if there was a nice route to transition into IT from a cs degree. I have only got 2 callbacks, but I think those have failed as they did the usual we will contact you later. I suspect my greatest limitation maybe the fact im limiting myself to Georgia, but Atlanta had a lot of new companies open up tech companies there so it might be on me. I will remain hopeful though and with an open mind. I saw more ai websites and stuff like that and was wondering if anyone used any of those or any other strategy I may not know about. Sadly this months tech networking event was cancelled, but if I am still jobless I will go to next month's meetup.",

For the next 3 years, I grew it to a team of 40 people and was in active negotiations with Nvidia to introduce RTX into our game (it was 2019 when Nvidia just published it). I was studying just enough to keep the scholarship, but nothing more.After we ran out of funding, and closing it, I joined an American based startup as VP of Product & engineering, but after 6 months got promoted to CIO, where I was responsible for our product portfolio and managing our engineering and R&D departments.During this time, I got headhunted by one of the largest corporations in Europe and wanted me to work as Senior Project Manager (had to wear Product Manager hat too often). They made it clear, they wanted me no mater what, doubled my salary and put me in big projects to work for. And after 2.5 years, it was one of the most amazing working experiences as had to deal with hundreds of engineers and millions of dollars in projects.After some internal things, I decided to go in business on my own, and start a digital agency. it was one of the roughest experiences even though within 1 year I had 3 other employees and 15 clients. And decided to close this in beginning of June.\\-- now July --I had an interview today, and one of the HR said that my CV seems like I'm lying. I just turned 29, so it is impossible for me to have done all of this. (I have recommendation letters, experience, posts and everything to prove my work...). I asked some of my friends about this and they said the same thing too, and even suggested I lower the tittle for example from CIO to just Head of Product Management Office.I'm looking to join startups where I can bring best of my experience and knowledge, but I am seriously getting worried what my friends are suggesting.from 50 tailored applications I have done, I've had only 1 interview, so I'm really wondering if ATS is screwing me up, or HR see's it and thinks \"just bloated stuff\" and ignores it.What do you think?im seriously stuck thinking for this.PS: made this post on EU version but got automatically removed.",

        "content": "I've worked 3 jobs in my career.The first was in defense industry (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc). I worked on a radar project that was pretty cool. Tbh, we hardly had meetings and just had stand up oince a day and outside of that it was mostly reaching out to people for help and once a month a product meeting with the clients. Once a quarter we had a 2 day sprint planning event that really was a waste of 2 days with most engineers just nodding along while the managers and POs did all the talking.Second job was in FAANG - it seemed like even as a mid-level Engineer I had to spend half my day in meetings, a quarter of my day reaching out to people and the rest of the time coding. Obviously 2 hours coding isnt enough, so it caused people to have to work an extra 2-4 hours a day. Stand up was everyday for 30 minutes. No meetings friday was hardly respected. If you werent it felt like you were behind if your days didnt look like this. It was very on the go. Even in the meetings, it felt like everything was a discussion that took an extra hour of meeting time. ANythign brought up during parking lot took an hour to resolve. You put a for loop but a principal engineer wants you to do a while loop? Let's discuss it for an hour about why for loops are better or worse. If you needed to talk to anybody, you had to schedule time and theyd get annoyed if you went over the alloted scheduled time. It was stressfula nd when I left I was glad I was gone.Current job is at big tech but not FAANG - It seems meetings are the last thing on their mind. We have stand up twice a week. Twice a month we have an extended stand up. Even then it goes by pretty quickly (most of the time it takes half the scheduled time). Parking lot items are resolved really fast unless someone is confused about the code. Im still fairly new but i get the vibe that it's similar to my first job where you can just reach out to someone and tehy didnt mind spending an hour with you to talk it through. Once a quarter they do a \"no meetings week\" where major meetings are cancelled. This was a shocker i've never heard about, in my last job that is something laughable and seen as a waste of useful time. What's surprsiing is I make more in this job than I did in FAANG for what seems like will be less stress.Just wondering how common it is in other jobs when it comes to meetings?Edit: im 7 YOE as a backend SWE if that helps.",

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice?

The company has multiple projects that have received funding, but the one I applied for is very early and has not. I'm a fresh grad with no internships unfortunately and I need experience, but I also need pay, and this job seems to expect a full time commitment which I would not be able to balance with my current part time job that does pay.The biggest thing holding me back from taking this role is that the company is \"employee owned\" and during the meeting they talked about how ownership is taken by everybody and there will most likely not be a senior ahead of me providing guidance.

I applied to openings in other cities, but the the number of openings were so little compared to the number of applicants so the competition was crazy, I couldn't get a job for about a year.Afterwards, I found a role as a teacher, so, I started teaching programming fundamentals and web development, I kept this job for 2 years, during which I tried applying to as much software development jobs as possible on LinkedIn and everywhere else, mainly looking for fully remote roles in the US or elsewhere.Then, I found a role at a startup as a paid intern, gotten through the interview and started work as a contractor.My initial contract was for 6 months, after that was over I signed a different contract for another 6 months, this time as a Jr. Software Developer. After this contract ended, they renewed it again as a Jr. Software Developer, but this time for 4 months, because the startup was failing. So, in total I worked as fully remote contractor for 1 year and 4 months.Then, I was jobless, I started looking for jobs again for about 6 months, then out of nowhere, the same employer from before got in touch with me and recommended me to a different startup looking for contractors. I happily accepted the offer and started work, the problem is, I wasn't even assigned a title in this new startup, I was a software developer, but I didn't know whether Jr, Mid? However, based on my own evaluation I still considered myself Jr.I was the only developer on the frontend team for this new startup, I was responsible of taking a full Figma design from scratch and implement it with React, I have to be honest I had to use a component library to get the job done, because the deadline was very close and everything was fast paced, there was no room for code refactoring, code quality, TBF I didn't even write tests! But, I ended up delivering in time, and after a couple of rounds of bug fixing, the client was happy.However, after about 8 months, I lost this job because the startup failed to secure funding again.Now, I feel a bit lost on where to move on from here. Getting a job for a US-based employer is very difficult, especially once they learn that I am based in Iraq.I have a couple of questions:1. Am I a dead cause? Is there still hope? I mean I am still a Jr.2. How should I structure my resume? I have no past projects other than the work I've put for my past 2 employers?",

Software is extensible and scalable, but I have no reference of whether this is how it's developed at a major tech company.Is it attractive to teams hiring for CS careers at bigger tech companies to see this kind of experience? On one hand, it's a lot more than junior work like building specific features and testing them - it involves interviewing stakeholders, learning their needs, and figuring out how to translate that into features and how to design the software to be able to grow sustainably without having a team of other developers to lean on. On the other hand, for all I know it could be riddled with bad habits and blind spots.Most job postings with PhD qualifications are mid- to advanced-stage roles, but having not \"grown up\" in a \"professional\" team environment, I'm not sure I have the relevant experience to be able to head a team in a conventional, expected way. At the same time, while I personally don't have hang-ups about starting lower on the totem pole, I'm not sure if my experience and degree path would make me appear over-qualified for a more entry position? As in, over-qualified but under-skilled, so, pass and on to the next candidate. Opinions, or do you have experience hiring folks with \"unconventional\" career paths?",

Having a difficult time finding a new job -- I think part of it is that only 2.5 years puts me at an uncomfortable position where I'm not a new grad but also not exactly an experienced dev, but the other problem is that I just feel like I... can't *do* anything. At my company I spent the majority of the time on our bug-fixing team. Idk if this is how things usually are at big companies but our codebase was largely undocumented and no one ever explained to me how anything really worked -- everything I learned I learned because I asked about it directly. Most of the bugs I fixed were either very clear-cut, where I could just look at the code and identify the problem, or for more abstract ones I did it with a lot of guidance from a senior dev. I spent a bit of time on other teams \"helping\" implement new features but I was largely in over my head and being held by the hand by my seniors while just trying to absorb whatever I could. So I know how to code I guess. I can pick up new languages and I can look at simple things and sort of understand what they're doing and I understand principles like data structures, algorithms, encapsulation, inheritance, etc, all stuff you would find in a college course. I've also done 100+ puzzles on AdventOfCode, which I usually find to be not super difficult but have also learned about stuff I wasn't super knowledgeable about like dynamic programming and sorting algos while doing them. I feel like I'm a good employee. I'm not afraid to ask questions and I'm well-spoken and I'm proactive about my work rather than sitting in silence when I get stuck. I love to learn new stuff and always take opportunities that are presented to me. But I don't feel like any of my knowledge transfers to an actual workplace environment. I can't build apps or deploy microservices or optimize software or develop new features. I subscribe to /r/programming and read stuff there but I usually understand like 5% of it. I thought I would learn once I got my first job but I spent most of that time fixing bugs and trying to understand how our product even worked. I was discussing moving to a different team to start gaining more skills with my supervisor but then I was laid off. I know lots of programmers build stuff in their free time but I have no idea what to even make. I don't even know if I *can* make anything. So what do I do? How do I learn? Hope I get a better job? Do a boot camp? Grad school?Would be very greatful to hear how any of you transitioned from being a booksmart college level programmer to an actual developer",

Do I need to have a strong foundation in coding before the schooling, or can I go into a computer science program and expect to learn coding from the basics.

No internships, but I do have a couple projects and active linkedin/github. After applying for a few months I’ve basically got nothing to show for the last two years.

Im back living with my parents for the last 3 months after a break up (9 year relationship), and the idea of pursuing my bachelors would probably mean I’d be still living at home for another 2 years minimum, which kind of depresses me in and of itself - being here the whole time and not having a real bachelors until I’m (at least) 32, I mean, Im a grown man. I feel embarrassed and that I shouldn’t have to rely on my mom and step-dad still.I’m getting quite overwhelmed with these feelings of hopelessness in this field or if I should just pivot to something else, maybe get some IT certs and start at a help-desk position or do school part time or something, I really just don’t know.

I was an intern twice and was asked to come back full time. Last week I found out that I will be working on a distributed systems team that codes almost entirely in C++. The product is internal and was the basis of an industry revered paper from the company in the early 2010’s, think Chubby or Kubernetes. I met with the manager a few days ago, and he seems really nice, but cautioned me that the work is quite challenging. Of course I am super grateful to be in such a position given the condition of the market, and I look forward to learning as much as I can. However, I can’t help but feel anxious about starting my new job. I have zero experience in distributed systems and did not even take the class since it was only offered at my school during my first year there. I did take a networking class, which touched a bit on some of the fundamentals of distributed systems (CAP theorem, concurrency), but really nothing practical and useful. My experience with C++ is quite limited as well, as I have mostly coded in Java and Python. With that said, how can I succeed at my new job? What advice would you give to a new grad trying to learn as much as they can while delivering in what is likely a team full of experts? How do you fight the inevitable imposter syndrome? Any resources I can leverage? I recently picked up Designing Data-Intensive Applications and have been polishing up my C++, but I start in a couple of weeks so there is not much time. Your advice would be much appreciated.
