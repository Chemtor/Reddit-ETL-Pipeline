I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.But the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.All the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",

        "content": "I’m a newly minted Data Engineer, with what little experience I have, I’ve noticed quite a few glaring issues with my workplace, causing me to start hating my job. Here are a few:- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. - We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. I don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem. Additionally, if there are other problems you’d like to point out (other than people being difficult to work with), please do so.",

        "content": "I am curious what was your role under each title, similarities and differences in knowledge and which you ultimately prefer and why?I know some people say DE is a subset of SWE, but I don't necessarily feel this way about my job. I see that there is a lot of debate about the DE role itself, so I'm not sure if there is a consensus of this role either. Basically, my DE job entails creating SQL tables, but more so than that a ton of my time just goes into trying to figure out what people want without any proper guidance or documentation. I don't interact with the stakeholders but I have colleagues who are supposed to translate to me what the stakeholders want. Except that they don't...they just tell me to complete a task with my only guiding documents being PDFs, data dictionaries, other documents related to the projects. Sometimes, my only guidance is previous projects, but when I use those as templates I'm told I can't rely on that since every project is different. This ends up just being a constant back and forth stream and when there is a level of concensus reached as to what exactly the project is supposed to accomplish, it finally becomes a clean table in SQL that is frequently used as the backend data source for a front-end application for stakeholders to use (I don't build this application). I have touched Python very rarely at my job. I am supposed to get a task where I should be doing more stuff in Python but I'm not sure if that's even going to happen. I'm kind of more a technically minded person. When my job requires me to find solutions by writing code and developing, I feel like I can tolerate my job more. I'm not finding my current responsibilities technical enough for my liking. The biggest gripe I have is that the person who should be helping guide me with business/stakeholder needs is frequently too busy to communicate properly with me and never tells me what exactly the project is, what the stakeholders want and keeps telling me to 'read documents' to figure it out, documents that have zero guidance as to the project. When things get delayed because I have to spend forever trying to figure out what exactly I should be doing, there's a lot of frustration directed at me. I personally think I'd be happier as a backend SWE, but I am uncertain and would love to hear from others what they preferred between DE and SWE and why. I would consider changing to a different DE role but with SQL being the only thing I use (I do have experience otherwise in Python and JavaScript, just not at my current job), I'm afraid I'm not going to be technically competitive enough for other DE roles either. I don't know what else to consider if I want to switch jobs. I've been told my skills may transfer to project/product management but that's not at all the direction I was thinking of taking my career in....",

These days the only times I get in contact with DE is when I am called out to look at an excessive error rate in some random ETL jobs. So my exposure to this is limited to when it does not work and that makes it biased.At my previous job, the entire data pipeline was written in Python. 80% of the time, catastrophic failures in ETL pipelines came from a third-party vendor deciding to change an important schema overnight or an internal team not paying enough attention to backward compatibility in APIs. And that will happen no matter what tech you build your data pipeline on.But Python does not make it easy to do lots of healthy things like ensuring data is validated or handling all errors correctly. And the interpreted, runtime-centric nature of Python makes it - in my experience - more difficult to debug when shit finally hits the fan. Sure static type linters exist, but the level of features type annotations provide in Python is not on the same level as what is provided by a statically typed language. And I've always seen dependency management as an issue with Python, especially when releasing to the cloud and trying to make sure it runs the same way everywhere.And yet, it's clearly the most popular option and has the most mature ecosystem. So people must love it.What are you guys' experience reaching to Python for writing your own ETL jobs? What makes it great? Have you found more success using something else entirely? Polars+Rust maybe? Go? A functional language?",

Would love to get some expert insights from the communityUse Case Overview:We support multiple data sources (currently 5–10, more will come) including:SQL ServerREST APIsS3BigQueryPostgresUsers can create accounts and register credentials for connecting to these data sources via a dashboard.Our service then pulls data from each source per account in 3 possible modes:Hourly: If a new hour of data is available, download.Daily: Once a day, after the nth hour of the next day.Daily Retry: Retry downloads for the last n-3 days.After download:Raw data is uploaded to cloud storage (S3 or GCS, depending on user/config).We then perform light transformations (column renaming, type enforcement, validation, deduplication).Cleaned and validated data is loaded into Postgres staging tables.Volume & Scale:Each data pull can range between 1 to 5 million rows.Considering DuckDB for in-memory processing during transformation step (fast + analytics-friendly).Which orchestration framework would you recommend for this kind of workflow and why?We're currently evaluating:Apache AirflowDagsterPrefectKey Considerations:We need dynamic DAG generation per user account/source.Scheduling flexibility (e.g., time-dependent, retries).Easy to scale and reliable.Developer-friendly, maintainable codebase.Integration with cloud storage (S3/GCS) and Postgres.Would really appreciate your thoughts around pros/cons of each (especially around dynamic task generation, observability, scalability, and DevEx).Thanks in advance!",

We recently ran some detailed benchmarks comparing its performance and cost against several popular data movement tools: Fivetran, Debezium (using the memiiso setup mentioned), Estuary, and Airbyte. The benchmarks covered both full initial loads and Change Data Capture (CDC) on a large dataset (billions of rows for full load, tens of millions of changes for CDC) over a 24-hour window.More details here: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks) How the dataset was generated: [https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)# Some observations:* OLake hit \\~46K rows/sec sustained throughput across billions of rows without bottlenecking storage or compute.* $75 cost was infra-only (no license fees). Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.Sharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.Note: Full Load is free for Fivetran.",

        "content": "I’ve been occasionally working on this in my spare time and would appreciate feedback. The idea for ‘framecheck’ is to catch bad data in a data frame before it flows downstream. For example, if a model score > 1 would break the downstream app, you catch that issue (and then log it/warn and/or raise an exception). You’d also easily isolate the records with problematic data. This isn’t revolutionary or new - what I wanted was a way to do this in fewer lines of code in a way that’d be more understandable to people who inherit it. There are other packages that aren’t pandas specific that *can* do the same things, like great expectations and pydantic, but the code is a lot more verbose. Really I just want honest feedback. If people don’t find it useful, I won’t put more time into it. pip install framecheckRepo with reproducible examples:https://github.com/OlivierNDO/framecheck",

But that didn't change, it was like that before the increase in costs.* The tables follow the \\[One Big Table\\](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/one-big-table/) data modelling * It could be something else, but the incremental in costs came just after that.My question would be, is it possible that changing the partition granularity from DAY to MONTH resulted in such a huge increase or would it be something else that we are not aware of?",

Their thinking behind this is that this gives the greatest flexibility when it comes to different asks by the business. For example if tomorrow the business wants to create another report, you are not locked down to the data types enforced in staging for the needs of the first use case. Personally I find this a bit of an odd decision but would like to hear your thoughts on this. Edit: the issue was that he once had defined a column as BIGINT only for business to come later and say nulls are allowed so they had to go back and change to Double and reload all data.In our case though we are working with BigQuery and most data types do accept nulls.",

It's \\~2 dozen azure SQL databases, none huge at all by modern standards. But they do have a LOT of tables and the transformation needs aren't trivial. And whatever we build needs to be deployable to additional instances with similar source db's ideally using some automated approach. I.e. don't want to build manually or by hand the same thing for all \\~15-20 customer instances.At this point I just need to put together a matrix of options running from \"write some python and do it manually\", to \"use parameterized data factory jobs\", to \"just buy a tool\". ADF looks a bit expensive IMO, although I don't have a ton of experience with it. Anybody been through a similar process recently? When does an expensive ETL tool become \"worth it\"? And how to sell that value when you know the pressure coming will be \"but it's free to just write python code\".",

I’m using tools I love — GCP, Airflow, Spark, SQL — and have built a strong reputation with my manager, who’s expressed interest in converting me to full-time when the budget allows. The catch? There’s no clear timeline, and I’m expecting my first child later this year, so stability and benefits are becoming a priority.Now, I’ve been approached with a full-time offer at a smaller company working in healthcare data. The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community. I haven’t worked with Fabric directly, but I understand the concepts (like medallion architecture, data governance, etc.). I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.My questions:Has anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?How much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?What would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?What other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?Appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!",

If you’re not interested in my context and motivation, feel free to skip the paragraph below and go straight to describing your day – whether by following my guiding questions or just sharing your own perspective freely.I’ve tagged this post with *career* because I’m currently in the process of applying for data engineering positions. I’ve become particularly interested in working with data in cloud environments – in the past, I’ve worked with SQL databases and also had some exposure to OLAP systems. To prepare for this role, I’ve completed several courses and built a few non-commercial projects using cloud services such as Databricks, ADF, SQL DB, DevOps, etc.Right now, I’m applying for Cloud Data Engineer positions in Azure, especially those related to ETL/ELT. I’d like to understand what everyday work in commercial projects actually looks like, so I can better prepare for interviews and get a clearer sense of what employers mean when they talk about “commercial experience.” This post is mainly addressed to those who already work in such roles.Here are some optional guiding questions (feel free to use them or just describe things your way):* What does a typical workday look like for a data engineer working with ETL/ELT tools in the cloud (Azure/GCP/AWS – mainly Data Services like Databricks, Spark, Virtual Machines, ADF, ADLS, SQL Database, Synapse, etc.)?* What kind of tasks do you receive? How do you approach them and how much time do they usually take?* How would you classify tasks as easy, medium, or advanced in terms of difficulty – could you give examples?* Could you describe the context of your current project?* Do you often use documentation and AI? What is the attitude toward AI in your team and among your managers?* What do you do when you face a problem you can’t immediately solve? What does team communication look like in such cases?* Do you take part in designing the architecture and integrating services?* What does the lifecycle of a task look like?* How do you usually communicate – is it constant interaction or more asynchronous work, e.g. through Git?I hope I managed to express clearly what I’m looking for. I also hope this post helps not only me but other aspiring data engineers as well. Looking forward to hearing from you!I’ll be truly grateful for any response – whether it’s a detailed description of your workday or more general advice and reflections.",

Instant rejections.Now I know the job market isn't the hottest right now, but the one thing I'm struggling with is understanding what's missing. How do I know what my experience should have, when I'm applying to a certain job/industry? I'm eager to learn, but without a sense of direction or something to compare myself with, it's extremely difficult to figure out. The general guideline is to connect/network with people, but after countless LinkedIn connection requests I still can't find someone who would be interested in discussing their experiences.So my question is simple. How do you guys figure out what to do to shape your career? How do you know what you need to learn to get to a certain position?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.We have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.Our project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.The data team proposed this workflow:1.Add a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.2.Run ML models on that data.3.Send predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.This feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. Is this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?Would love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",

        "content": "Hey there, Im a bit of a spark ui novice and I'm trying to understand what is creating the bottle neck in my current glue job. For this run, we were using a g.8x with 2 workers.This job took 1 hour 14, and 30 minutes of the job were between 2 jobs. A GlueParquetHadoopWriter and rdd at DynamicFrame.I am trying to optimize these two tasks so i can reduce the job run time.My current theory is that we convert our spark dataframe to a dynamic frame so that we can write partitions out to our glue tables. I think this step is the rdd at Dynamic Frame job, i think its shuffling(?) to a rdd.The second job i think is the writes to s3, this being the GlueParquetHadoopWriter. Currently if we run this job for multiple days, we have to write out partitions at the day level, which i think makes the writes take longer. Example if we run for \\~2 months, we have to partition the data to day level then write it out to s3 (60\\~ partitions).Im struggling to come up with solutions on how to increase the write speed, we need the data in this partition structure for downstream so we are pretty locked. Would writing out bulk and having another job pick the file up to repartition it be faster? My mind thinks this just means we would then pay for cold start costs twice and get no real benefit.Interested to hear ideas people have on diagnosing/speeding up these tasks!

The second company has no DE team, so I, a junior, would build everything up, currently they are manually querying SQL databases, with minor Python automation. My main concern is not being able to use sought after DE tools that will help me down the line in my next job.The first one is more standard in terms of what I'm used to, I have 2 years of experience at a similarly sized company, where DE cloud tools were used. But in my experience this kind of environment is less demanding in terms of responsibility, so I could start getting too comfortable.Which one would you choose? I'm leaning towards cloud megacorp due to stability and the future being cloud tech. Are there any arguments for choosing onprem only?Thank you for reading.",

Why would they do that without any warning or explanation beforehand or at least after archiving it? Do you think it is better to slowly prepare to switch do dbt or stay on dataform?",

        "content": "Hello,I'm a student/employee at a governmental banking institution. My contract is due to end in November of this year at which point I'll graduate and be on the job market. My work so far has been scripting in Python to aggregate data and deliver it to my supervisor who does business specific analytics in Excel. I export data from SAP Business Objects and run a Python solution on it that does all of the cleaning, aggregations and delivers multiple csv files of which only two are actively used in Excel for dashboarding.We've had problems with documentation of the upstream data that had us waste a lot of time finding the right people to explain some of the things we needed to access to do what we do. So my supervisor wants us to have a suitable, structured way of documenting our work to contribute to the enhancement of the state of Data Cataloguing at our firm.On the other hand, I haven't felt satisfied in what I've been doing so far, 7 months into the work. My motivation has declined slowly and it's quite obvious that my relationship with my supervisor has suffered from it (lack of communication, not much work on the table, etc...). I would like to change this reality and give myself the opportunity to show that I could be more of use if I'm put to work on the technical aspects more so than following the trail of my supervisor on the business oriented work. I understand that I must ultimately be in service of the business goals but as explained above, doing Python scripting on excel and csv files then letting him do the dashboarding in Excel while I sit back and wait for another need to be done isn't very fulfilling on all levels (academically, I need to showcase how I used my technical expertise in DE. Professionally, I need to show that I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining robust data pipelines. The job market is hard enough as it is for the freshly graduated, not having any actual work under my belt on some of the widely used technologies in the field of DE)Eventually, the hope is to suggest a data pipeline to replace what we've been doing so far. Instead of exporting csv and excel from SAP Business Objects, loading in them in Python, doing transformations in Python, then exporting csv and excel files for the supervisor to load them using Power Query in Excel and do his dashboarding there I suggest the following: \\- Exporting from SAP BO and immediately loading into an Object Storage System, I have experience with MinIO. \\- Ingesting data from the files into PostgreSQL as a Data Warehouse. \\- Using DBT+Python to do the Transformations & Quality Control (Is it possible to only use DBT to preprocess the data, i.e remove duplicate rows, clean up columns, build new columns? I do these in Python already) \\- Using a different tool for BI (I worked with PowerBI & Metabase before) \\- Finally, a Data Catalog to document everything we're doing. I have experience with Datahub but my company uses Informatica Axon and I don't have access to ingesting any metadata or adding any data sources.I appreciate anyone who read my lengthy post and suggested their opinion on what I should do and how I should go about this. It's a really good company to work at (from a salary and reputation pov) so having a few years here under my belt after graduating would help my career significantly but I need to be of use to them for this.",

I scrape and clean the data in notebooks, multiple notebooks as there are multiple tables focusing on different aspects of performance e.g. shooting, passing, defending, goalkeeping, pass types etc.I then create relationships across the tables and then load them into a database I created in Google's BigQuery. At first I collected and only used data from previous seasons to set up the database, before updating it with this current season's data. As the current season hasn't ended (actually ended last Saturday), I wanted to be able to handle more recent updates by just rerunning the notebooks without affecting other season's data. That's why the current season is handled in a different folder, and newer seasons will have their own folders too.I'm a beginner in terms of databases and the methods I use reflect my current understanding.TLDR: I built a database of Women Super League players using data scraped from Fbref.

My gripes with our current approach are:1. Our HPC cluster doesn't have good spark support. Running any spark application involves spinning an independent cluster with a series of lengthy bash scripts. We have tried to simplify this as much as possible but ease-of-use is valuable in an academic setting.2. Our rust tools are fast and efficient, but impossible to maintain since very few people are familiar with rust, MPI, multithreading... I have been experimenting with dask as an easier-to-use tool (with slurm support!) but so far it has been... not great. It seems to eat up a lot more memory than the latter two (although it might be me not being familiar with it)Any thoughts?",

However, I'm currently stuck and unsure how to proceed.The project involves processing monetary transactions. My company collaborates with international partners who send daily Excel files containing the transactions they've paid for that day. Meanwhile, my company has its own database of all transactions it has processed.I’ve already worked on the partner Excel files and built a data warehouse for them on my own server (Server B). My company’s main transaction database is on Server A. However, Server A cannot be accessed through linked servers or any application—its use is restricted to tools like SSMS, SSIS, Power BI, and similar.The goal of the project is to identify unpaid transactions, meaning those that exist in the company database (Server A) but not in the new data warehouse (Server B). I also need to calculate metrics such as total number of transactions, total amount, total unpaid amount, and how many days have passed since the last payment. Additionally, I must create visualizations and graphs, and provide filtering options by partner, along with an option to download the filtered data as a CSV file.My main problem is that I don't know what to do next. Should I use Power BI or build an application using Streamlit? Also, since comparing data between Server A and Server B is essential, I’m not sure how to do that efficiently without importing all the data from Server A into Server B, which would be impractical given that there are over 2 million transactions.Can someone please guide me or give me at least a hint on the right direction?",

Are there ways to handle the encryption type mismatch client-side from the VM that runs the self-hosted integration runtime?

Because we already worked with csv-files for persistence, I want to do my current task using an embedded sqlite-database. But unlike the csv-file approach that I completed, there's a problem with database.The task is to make a small checkout for sales. The following models are neededProducttype Product ; has a Produkttype LineItem ; has a Product Sale ; has a List of LineItemsWhere in the version of my task, where I used csv-files, it just saved Sales and thats it, a database will now cause a problem.I have a Product that references a Typ, a LineItem will reference a Product, a Sale references a List of LineItems.But a Sale is a one time event. So the \"history\" of Sales saved in the database shouldn't be able to be changed afterwards. But with a normalized database, when I someday change the price of a product, all the sales will also change, because of using references.My thoughts of possible solutions1 - Data Historization I could copy all referenced data into an archive table, when an entity is about to be changed and change all referenced from the product to its archived version.2 - Product versioning Basically the same as 1 but I have only one table and an extra attribute \"Version\" and everytime I change something the Version goes up, and the GUI will only fetch the ones with the highest version, while Sales reference the versions they were created with.3 - Denormalization We were taught to normalize, but I also read that if needed, it's better to denormalize for simplicity instead of making everything super complicated to maybe save a bit of performance. By that I mean, I create a column for every attribute and save it directly in the Sales table. But that means this could in theory lead to infinite columns over a long enough time.So which option, or maybe a completely different one, is the goto method to solve this problem?

On top of all that, I still struggle with basic decisions. Like, a week ago, I was having a crisis because I couldn’t figure out if I was using classes properly. Like, I feel like the loop I’ve been in is I learn a bunch of stuff, but then I don’t understand it, so I don’t use it or I apply it incorrectly, so I go back to the way I was coding before, but then the code is ass and it’s absolutely painful to refactor, so I restart. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t want to admit to it because of how much time I’ve put into it, but I feel like I’m following a false passion.",

That’s why I started learning PHP and Laravel on my own and luckily, I got to use them during my internship.Now I’m in the final weeks of that internship, where I built a full Laravel + Filament application that includes things like resources, policies, custom actions, Slack notifications, etc. Here's what I can do at the moment:* PHP & Laravel (main focus now since I'm really interested in Laravel)* Laravel Filament & Livewire (internship)* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (school)* Vue.js (school)* Astro.js (learning on my own because it looks useful for statics)* Tailwind CSS* Craft CMS (school)* SQL / database knowledge (school & internship)* Working with tools like DDEV & Vite (school & intership)I’m aiming to become a solid backend/PHP developer, but since I'm almost graduated I still wonder: how “good” do you really need to be to get that first junior job?

I looked through all the rules and terms before I took it, and there was not one direct mention of whether reading documentation or looking things up was fair game or not. From their other rules, it seemed to potentially imply that they only wanted one window/tab open, so I went into this test with no resources.Suffice it to say, it didn't go so well. It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).So my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them? I figure that in the real world, methods, libraries, etc., can always be looked up, so I don't typically set aside storage space in my brain to remember all of them. Should I devote more attention to this?",

This book teaches programming with a 1990s-style approach. It may not use the latest tools, but I’ve heard it actually teaches how to think like a programmer and builds real logic skills.Once I finish it, I plan to take the University of Helsinki’s Java MOOC. Again, sticking to fundamentals and learning the core ideas, not just trendy frameworks.For context, I’m not naturally a math person either—I’m teaching myself beginning college algebra right now. That’s less about going old-school and more because I never had a college education, so I’m starting from scratch across the board.So, does this sound like a solid strategy? My goal isn’t a career—just a deep, strong foundation to see if I can really do this.What do you all think?",

So it makes me wonder if even Google is hanging it up with Angular on a slow transition if they don't even use their own frameworks?

And want help in my next steps..The main issue, is that I've lost all motivation or drive to work on the project. But I'm not sure if i should start a new one in the interim. The project isn't overly \"difficult\" and honestly I've probably finished the most difficult parts of it. The problem lies in not entirely understanding wtf I'm doing or why. The issue? I basically asked GPT to help me think of a project that was out of my scope. I normally don't use AI at all, trying to learn everything myself, only asking small questions when i get stuck for too long. But this project was kind of.. perfect? It showed how weak i was in certain areas, and I've been learning to fill the gaps.The issue is that I've been unwell, and every time i jump back into this project, i feel overwhelmed and spend more time remembering what i was doing, than actually doing anything. However I've already begun adding it on github, and i feel like, as a resume-project, it may look a little bad that i started it, and paused for a couple weeks?So I'm not sure what to do, either i force myself to cram and finish it, even just a super basic version. Or i put the entire project on hold, finish something a little smaller, to add to github, and then go back to it. I just.. feel stuck, overwhelmed, and not sure if i should just scrap it entirely tbh.",

The issue is that throughout the whole semester we only covered the mathematics side of functional declarative programming however we never had any practice. I simply cannot wrap my head around the syntax of declarative programming since what I have been learning is imperative. Everywhere i look online shows basic examples of it like \"lst = \\[x\\*2 for x in lst\\]\" and there are no examples of more complex code, e.g. nested loops or branching. On top of this, everywhere that mentions declarative programming they all say that you should not update values throughout the lifespan of the program but that is quite literally impossible. I have spoken to my teacher multiple times and joined several support sessions but i still have no clue how to program declaratively. I understand that i need to \"say what result i want, not how to get to it\" but you still write code in a specific syntax which was simply not exposed to us at a high enough lvl to be able to go and write a small program.

Because using csv-files is something we did in every practice so far, and it's nothing new at this point. While with csv-files, the problem was to make sure you don't have redundancies, the problem with a database is now the other way around. Here is a simplified layout without any m:n:Product(id as PK, name, price) LineItem(id as PK, volume, product as FK) Sale(id as PK, lineitem as FK)Products need to be able to be updated, because you can edit them. But LineItem and in the end, Sales should not be able to change. With this normalized setup, changing the price of a product, would also change them in all line-items and sales from the past. That obviously must not happen. So what would be the best practice to save a \"history\" of Sales? Save the price in the LineItem? But what if the name changed. So saving the entire Product in the LineItem? But what if the Product becomes bigger, then I'd end up with a lot of columns in Line item, which are also not referencing.Not really sure how this should be handled. Because DB is normally to have uptodate things, but here I want uptodate things, but also a history of records that shouldn't change after i create them.",

So, I’m choosing the self-taught path.My question is:Is it truly possible to become a front-end developer through self-learning and land an internship or junior role within a year if I build a few good projects?Would love to hear from anyone who’s done it or is on the same journey.",

I recently got back into programming and I've been learning for a few years now. I'm about to start my 3rd year of my Computer Science major. I have ADHD... really bad ADHD. Obviously, I'm medicated now, and that helps. My problem is trying to remember proper syntax. I can code just fine. Passed all my classes so far. Worked with C++, C#, Java, HTML, and CSS without issues EXCEPT I cannot remember proper syntax for the life of me. I know what I need to do. I know how to get there. I just can't ever remember code syntax and structure. Going from C++ to C# was especialy frustrating. I can't tell you how many times I wrote Console.PrintLine() instead of Console.WriteLine(). I constantly have to have a reference open on my computer to help me remember syntax. Here's an example: Lets say I'm building a class. I would need to have something like this open to help me remember syntax: public class MediaItem { // Properties common to all media items public string Title { get; set; } public int PublicationYear { get; set; } // Constructor for the base class public MediaItem(string title, int publicationYear) { Title = title; PublicationYear = publicationYear; Console.WriteLine(\"MediaItem constructor called.\"); } // A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes public virtual void DisplayInfo() { Console.WriteLine($\"Title: {Title}\"); Console.WriteLine($\"Publication Year: {PublicationYear}\"); }I would need to have this open in OneNote so I can reference because my memory is so terrible. Is this a bad practice? Is this a normal problem? Obviously, I know it will get better with repetition, but it is very frustrating.",

I know how I would build a TicTacToe in C or Python, but I have no idea how to translate all that into implementing the use of classes and objects.Hi everyone! I'm a programming student since 2020 and I went through a lot of languages that I loved and hated, but nothing was like Java.Recently, due to a Software Engineering course in my university, I had to start using Java and it's so so so difficult to me. Even a simple tic tac toe game it's difficult and I can't understand why.In the past, when I didn't understand something I always relied on YT videos and tutorials, but for Java I can't find any of that. No one who really explains how to start and finish a project or what are the good practices to follow.Is there anyone who has ever been in my situation and wants to advise me on how to proceed?",

I have never built anything from scratch and I have never done any mobile (android) work or full stack work and I don't know where to start.What should my technology stack stack look like?

With that, my friend and I would like to know how long it would possibly take to learn sql if we were to dedicate the next few weeks into it. We both set ourselves a deadline of exactly 2 weeks + 2 days (very ambitious I know; didn't really had a proper plan).We are also trying to do this to enhance our skills as aspiring programmers, and it would be great if you guys could provide any recommendations to sources where we could start learning off from.

        "content": "I’m sharing this experience as context for the title.I've been learning Python fundamentals, and one of the topics I recently explored was working with dictionaries and lists. Yesterday, I started building a simple contact book that uses these structures. The idea was for the program to ask the user how many contacts they'd like to add, and then prompt for each contact’s name, phone number, and email. The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.I spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it. .update({x: {y: z}})Where x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.I felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.All of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up. Where do I draw the line?",

I hate wasting my time.I would love some tips as to how to \"rejoin.\" Maybe you guys have a better platform or YouTube channel that I could use to replace Codecademy? I checked the FAQ and the learning resources, but I'm not very sure if this is what I'm looking for. I see things for AI, full-stack development, a CS course, which might or might not have a quarter of things that I already know. I'm a little lost. I checked [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh), and it definitely helps, but I'm looking for learning resources and not just a map of what to learn next. I don't like learning from YouTube videos unless I really have to. I prefer something as interactive and as structured as possible, like Codecademy or FreeCodeCamp. I was thinking of starting over with JavaScript, because I'm already comfortable with it, so I could probably get through the JS Codecademy course in like a week or less.

        "content": "Hey, guys! I'm planning to self-study computer science from scratch with the goal of reaching a job-ready (junior-to-mid level) skillset. My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one. Here's my current plan: 1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture. 2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). 3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects. 4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment. I'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources. ### My Questions:- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

I have the basics nailed down and I mostly only do projects which I know I can do with my knowledge set but there are some projects I do where I have to learn a bit of stuff before starting the project. But the thing is I don’t feel like these projects aren’t that good when you put on a resume. What I meant is they aren’t brand new project ideas but mostly projects HRs would have probably seen before on other resumes. And when trying to create projects which would be useful to me, I can’t think of any since I already have most of my issues solved by using open source projects other people made for the same issue :loudly_crying_face:",

As I am about to graduate, I’ve been reflecting on my academic journey and future career path.Although my major was in AI, I found that the quality of education in this area did not meet my expectations, especially in terms of practical experience and effective teaching methods. As a result, I’ve decided to shift my focus after graduation toward becoming a software engineer, with interests in both backend and frontend development.During my time in university, I didn’t have the opportunity to work on impactful projects within the curriculum, largely due to limitations in the local educational environment. That said, I’m eager to grow beyond that and make up for it through independent work and real-world experience.To recruiters and industry professionals:What kinds of projects would stand out to you on a resume for an entry-level software engineering role? I’d love some guidance on what you value most when evaluating candidates like me.",

My goal is to make Indie games, and I want a lot of flexibility. I've spent hours looking through UE5 courses, but most are towards generic FPS games, and I really can't find courses that teach with C++. All of them use blueprints. On the flip side of making your own game engine, I can find even fewer resources. I'm okay with any medium, be it book or website or video course. I simply want a thorough guide, with a complex project (beyond snake or tetris) that will get me to grips with it. I've tried doing it on my own, but it never went very far, as I have no idea how things are actually implemented, and I end up writing unintuitive code.

After using PyInstaller Extractor, I was left with a folder containing several .pyc files and a .pyz subfolder containing an extensive Python directory. I’m pretty sure I found the specific .pyc file that does what I’m looking for, but there are a lot of additional .pyc files in that directory that I’m struggling to understand the purpose of. The folder that contained the .pyc files and the .pyz directory looks like it mostly has initialization and compatibility code snippets, (the application references several .pyd and .dll files so I assume this is mostly related to compatibility between Python code and a windows executable file) but I’m not sure I understand why the meat and potatoes are all in a subfolder.",

        "content": "**Background:**I have taken an intro to programming class which covers the very basics of (console-only, no GUI) C# coding, and I loved it. I am a high school swimmer, and I have been heavily involved in running meets and repairing our timing system due to my schools limited funding. From this process I have noticed that the current \"industry standard\" meet management software leaves a bit to be desired and is exorbitantly expensive. I have always had an interest in computers and coding and I want to advance my skills. **End Vision** I have heard it is good to have a goal project as you learn. In the end (end likely means a matter of years as this is a side project/hobby), I would like to create something similar (an alternative to) *Hy-Tek Meet Manager For Swimming*. It does not have to be fully featured just to learn. This program runs on a database and tracks swimmers, events, and entries. It also has more advanced features including implementation with timing consoles and the sort, but I am currently not concerned with this. **My Question**What might be some coding languages/applications I would want to learn to approach a program like this? I am assuming I would need some form of database back end with a gui on the front. Where should I start? I would prefer not to take true college classes or anything like that. I know there are bootcamps, but Id much prefer to do something at my own pace as this is a side hobby. Any information is greatly appreciated!",

I don't won't keep on view the output of my pdf program in another pdf viewer or in my web browser.I have added a seperate renderer dll that will be mainly used for rendering the content of a pdf page onto a framebuffer with OpenGL and then displayed in an ImGUI window( the gui ). The renderer dll initializes the freetype library and loads the 14 pdf base font into a map.As of now the program can only parse some text only pdfs. When I want to render a page:I render the pages box in a 1:1 scale assuming the 1 pdf unit is 1 opengl vertice unit to keep things simple. I grab the text content of the page, the font used to render it and the font size and render. At the end the renderer in my GUI does not look the same as the one an actual pdf viewer.

It's not normal and I think it is breaking our industry.I was talking to a family member who was a developer in in 90s, and he said any time he needed a job he would apply to 5 roles and get at least one job offer. Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. Even in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.I feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. For those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.But every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

Instead of just wasting away, I decided to build a project that I had enough faith could pan out as a startup, and I’m doing it. I got 120 users within 2 days of my first public market test. I’m building relentlessly, and I got interviews at two startups. Three other companies reached out to me. For the first time in months, I actually had hope. I felt like I had a shot. Yesterday, the startup that had the culture and the work I’ve always dreamed about working at rejected me. The other one ghosted me. Why? Not because I was bad, or because I failed the interview. They just wanted someone with more experience on their stack. All those interview requests went the fuck away. I think that stung more than anything. I put in the work, so much work. I didn’t even fail through any fault of my own. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I really really don’t. Since that, I think I’ve actually applied to 145 apps in the past 2 days. I’ve reoptimized my resume 3 times in the past 2 days, which makes this my 30th iteration. I did everything I was supposed to do. I just want a job. I want to start my life. Forgive me for feeling sorry for myself. I just needed to do that this once. I’ve been so stoic and determined for five months, and now I get it.",

I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.I am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.Next day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.Edit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work.

The startup co-founder also doubles as my boss and it is a roughly 15 person startup. Time to start packing up and look for another job? The thing with this is now my parents are aware that I have to be falling behind on productivity. But the co-founder is trying to make them motivate me which is very weird",

        "content": "The market is tough for inexperienced folks. That is clear. However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).What I’ve seen:1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern. I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above. Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search? 3. Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse. Seriously?4. Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough. I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year. I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.5. Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff. I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again. I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before. Seriously?6. Can’t code your way out of a box. Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.7. Cheat on interviews with AI. It’s so common.8. Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles). You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.Do the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.",

        "author": "cscqthrowaway16661",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was hired at this company a few months ago, it's a larger startup with a few hundred employees, and I got in via the referral of a friend who works there, although he's in a different department. I was hired as a senior SWE but the impression I'm getting is that they basically wanted me to be a lead SWE instead. We have a principal on our team as well as a few juniors and midlevel, and essentially, they hired me not as an IC but I guess more of a manager of the juniors? The principal is too busy on multiple other teams and projects to really participate in our team, although he does sometimes.This all came to a head when a few weeks ago on the 1:1 the manager said I wasn't acting like I was the second in command so to speak, but I told them I felt hired as more of an IC and for the past few months before that, no one had communicated anything regarding managerial type work at all. Nevertheless, we agreed on some action items like me being more present in the Slack, doing more code reviews, mentoring the juniors (all of which I was doing already but I just started documenting them in a work log then), as well as creating tickets and assigning and delegating work, even if that means I do less overall IC work myself (but, isn't that what the managers and scrum masters are supposed to do? Why am I responsible for that part?). The 1:1 the week after that, they presented a PIP. The PIP itself is quite vague, it wants me to take more \"ownership\" and \"leadership\" of the project as I'm the only one on the team who can since the principal is so busy, part of which is talking more in meetings apparently. When I presented the action items I was already doing, they said it was a good start but I needed to do more, but they were very vague on what that actually meant, they couldn't really define it at all since it had nothing to do with concrete performance metrics like \"finished or didn't finish X tickets per sprint.\"It said PIP on the document but I didn't sign anything and they didn't ask me to, they didn't even CC HR like a traditional PIP would be. It's a 30 day one so I have to improve in the next 4 weeks apparently but I honestly don't get what they even want from me and every time I ask, they can't tell me anything more concrete. Essentially I think they hired me as a senior SWE when they really wanted to hire a lead (or even an engineering manager), and now they're trying to make me do lead/principal level work for senior pay (I'd need probably another 50k for that to happen). It all seems so sudden, like only a couple weeks ago they tell me about these sudden new \"performance\" problems when the several months before since I joined, there had been no complaints in the 1:1s.So now I'm just injecting myself in the meetings and asking questions no matter how dumb they sound, and it seems like the manager is pleased but it's all just so dumb, they literally said that they don't know if I understand things when I'm not talking in the meetings; I'm not talking so I can listen to what the more experienced team members are saying (we have some outside contractors and the full time devs were hired to eventually replace them, but in domain knowledge, the contractors know more than we do, so I also think the manager is comparing us to them too).Edit: I think people here are assuming I'm not doing senior level ticket cutting and talking often to the principal on architecture and code choices, etc, I am, it's that they seem to want even more people management type work in that they want me to essentially manage the work of the juniors and check in with them every couple days which is fine and which is something I've been doing but somehow they want even more management out of me.",

        "content": "Hi,So I just joined a job and then quit after a day, these are the following things happened from interview to the end of the first working day.Premise : It is a small startup(3 people: CEO, CTO(Non-technical, uses lovable to code), a month old web developer) which has raised $ 1.25 million.Interview Process- The CEO without introducing himself or the team, asked me - \"Tell me about yourself in few words\", then eventually he asked few other things, then salary expectations(which I told because I don't know what to say in these situations). Then he asked - When can you join - I told him, give me 2 weeks to think about it, the CEO said No, give me an early response. Then the CTO told him to atleast tell me about the company. Then he talked about the company. After it, I was desperate so I joined it.First day - They didn't even gave me any offer letter, just onboarded me on their payroll system, they didn't even gave me company laptops. So I started the day at 10 am, get every system access(github, backend) access around 11am-12 pm, they have already assigned me a ticket. Around 3 pm, the CTO asked me whether I am done, which I said No because they have hired me as an AI engineer position and their work/tickets assigned were for backend development. Then CEO came around 5 pm, started asking me whether I am done, then he further asked me around 7 pm- How much percentage I am done of the first ticket. I was really exhausted after 7:30 pm so I left, the ticket was still assigned. Also, second ticket was also assigned around nighttime to me.Meanwhile, at the same night, he called the other developer and asked him- How was my performance on the first day.I thought a bit at the same night, and then I told them I can't work there. All of my friends are saying that I should have stayed there, and I am behaving like an entitled Gen-Z and startups are run like this only and I should have collected atleast few paychecks. According to me, working there would have impacted my psyche negatively, and wasted my time which I could have utilised applying elsewhere.But am I over-reacting, am I a weak-willed person or was I correct in judging it.p.s - Office was in open areas of WeWork.",

I am the best at building front ends, but apparently I'm not the best at figuring out wordle edge cases while people with half my experience stare me.If you are in college for CS, I cannot tell you strongly enough to change your major to business. You're going to put in thousands of applications even when you have a decade of experience and you will have to go through endless interview rounds. Even when you are in demand, you will still need to jump through these endless hoops where people ask you completely useless facts and then smirk at you when you don't figure out the specific edge cases in the worldle app the made you code.Please do not respond to this by saying \"well that's just because it takes 5 interviews to tell whose a good software engineer.\" It doesn't. Software engineering is like any other profession, we do not need these endless tests.I feel like I am going crazy and seriously thinking about leaving the industry for one with an actual sane interview process. I've been doing this for seven months and I seriously am at the point where I am crying and exhauswted and have ptsd from these endless interviews!If you are in college for cs, change your major to business or some other type of engineering or literally anything!

I can do sliding windows and depth first searches off the cuff. I'm exhausted because unlike in the first seven years of my career, people have started to have 5 interviews on average, *including* coding tests. If everybody had reasonable hiring processes *like they used to* I would not be as angry even if I were failing them, because at least then I could move on quickly.Edit 2: I am not asking to do away with coding interviews. I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses. Every single of one of those failing businesses had elaborate hiring processes. Startup failure rates are blazingly high, 30 percent higher than other small businesses, because they do things like these stupid elaborate hiring processes.",

I dont know everybody's life so im making some assumptions here.",

        "content": "Hi all, I just finished my PhD and interviewed with AWS for a SDE2 position. However, I was downleveled to SDE1. I have a verbal offer from Huawei as a research engineer, and I'm interviewing with Meta for a research scientist position (however, I'm at the beginning of the process, and it would likely take me a couple of months). I'm EU based, all the positions are EU/UK based. I would love to move to US eventually, hence why I'm not too keen in joining Huawei. I definitely enjoyed meeting the AWS team, as it's very much related to my research topic.Would it look bad career-wise if I accept the SDE1 position at AWS, since I have a PhD?EDIT:Some clarifications. The research scientist role at Meta would be a \"glorified\" software engineering position. I do non-AI distributed system research, and I found basically no research-heavy opportunities for such a topic in EU, except for Huawei. On the other hand, a software engineering job in a company such as AWS or Meta would help me gain practical experience nonetheless",

Every word that came out of his mouth was filtered through a layer of buzzwords and asskissing to the point i had to mute my audio while he's talking. I counted down the day before he left and thought that was the end of it. The first workday of the new year is when our boss announced that this intern would be returning fulltime. My first issue with him was when i refactored a file in our codebase that he was also working on. He released a PR that undid everything i fixed in my refactor, but i was patient and told him when there are merge conflicts it's expected to meet with the other author to resolve it together. This happened just before i took a week of PTO and where i returned to find he blindly pushed his PR overwritting all my changes. My refactor got deprioritized for a couple weeks, but i finally got to remaking my changes only for him to try and do the same thing before being caught by another developer. At first all my complaints about him were about his personality, but after seeing more of his pull requests its become obvious he doesn't know how to code and is just copy/pasting AI responses without any thought as long as they accomplish the job. Our job gave every developer a Microsoft CoPilot license, which i also use to help get out of roadblocks, but reviewing his PRs is basically just rewritting AI slop.",

        "author": "Candid-Progress-1184",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "When writing your resume and negotiating pay, be mindful that Equifax operates a database called The Work Number that contains info on past employers, titles, pay, etc for a huge number of employees in the US. I recently discovered my report was wrong: it claimed I was a 'payroll specialist' rather than a 'computer systems engineer' at a previous employer because the person filling out the form put their own title instead of mine... About half my previous employers have entered data into it, and I have a feeling it might be integrated into modern HR tooling and ERP systems.Definitely check your report and make sure no one jacked up your previous title, pay, etc. Receiving a copy of any consumer credit report, including these ones, is free. My current employer tells them about every single one of my paychecks, so keep in mind future employers might literally be able to see when you got your raises too. If you're as cautious as I am, you probably want to make sure the titles listed on your resume at least bear a passing resemblance to the ones in the report so it doesn't set off alarm bells for HR folks who don't understand tech title equivalence. If you're considering overemployment, note that both roles could show up on the report.There are many other organizations that claim to provide info like this: I contacted the top 100 and no one else had any data on me, so I think The Work Number is far and away the most popular.It's possible to freeze your report just like any other credit report, but keep in mind this might look suspicious.Anyway, just be mindful that this stuff is out there and people have easy access to it. I think employers are technically supposed to tell you when the contents of a credit report are used against you, but it's impossible to enforce since they can just say nothing. You can get bad data removed for free as long as the employer either agrees it was wrong or just doesn't respond when Equifax contacts them.Stay safe and aware out there, folks.EDIT: Turns out they still have to get your consent before pulling this info, which occurs as part of the background check phase. Thanks to u/mediocreDev313 for the clarification!EDIT2: I just pulled up my report to double-check what all is on it. The report can include:Union affiliation, worker's comp award dates, reason for termination, base pay, overtime, commission, bonuses, holiday pay, pension income, severance, vested stock, stick and vacation pay, tips, hours worked for each individual pay period, garnishments, cafeteria plan fees, next projected date and amount of pay increase, last date and amount of pay increase, payroll deduction for insurance coverage, reasons for insurance ineligibility, insurance coverage level, number of covered dependents on insurance, and COBRA participation.EDIT3: Here's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's list of consumer reporting agencies, contact details, and links to freeze your various reports: [files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb\\_consumer-reporting-companies-list\\_2023.pdf](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-reporting-companies-list_2023.pdf)",

As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.I used to be assigned several stories per sprint, and could finish them with ample time, all while learning something too. However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.As a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.Was wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this?

I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.I've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.I'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",

        "content": "Hello, I’m a student of computer science. I’ve been learning coding since October in school. I’ve made quite a few projects. The thing is I feel like I’m cheating, because I find a lot of thing pointless to learn when I have full solution from AI in a few seconds. Things that would require me some time to understand, are at my fingertips. I can make a whole project required by my teacher and make it even better than is required, but with AI. Without it I’d have to spend like 4x time to learn things first, but when AI responds with ready code, I understand it, but it would take a lot of time for me to code it ‘that’ way.I enjoy it anyway and spend dozens of hours on projects with AI. I can do a lot with it while understanding the code but not that much without it.What is world’s take on this? How it looks like in corporations? Do they still require us to code something at interviews? Will this make me a bad coder?",

Thus, my employment would last around 6 to 8 months, depending on when I start. My question is whether I should mention this quit date during the application process or whether it's best to ommit it as it will hurt my chances of getting a job? Are companies typically open to agreeing to \"pause\" my contract for the duration of the exchange semester? I kind of feel bad if I don't mention it but perhaps it's the most strategic thing to do.Any advice or personal opinions would be greatly appreciated!",

Obviously my job takes up a lot of my time, plus I have other non-work obligations that I'm not willing to give up, so most days I feel like I'm wasting my time at work learning irrelevant skills while I should be leveling up in my field of interest instead. I'm used to living very frugally and have enough savings, and not many medical bills, so would it be crazy to quit my job to better spend my time gaining skills I actually want to use in my career? I would probably get a part-time job in the meantime to help myself but not take so much of my time. Thinking about this since I don't want to get stuck deeper into a career that I loathe - I am quite miserable albeit financially secure, and leveling up in an area of my interest is more important to me than money beyond basic survival. And this route is still cheaper than paying for a full-time master's degree lol. Wondering if anyone else has done this and if it was worth it.",

A couple years later I decided to switch careers, so I went back to school to study Computer Science. A bunch of my credits were transferred, so I finished the CS degree in 3 semesters with a 4.0 GPA and graduated in 2020. Since then… nothing. I’ve been applying for dev jobs ever since but haven’t been able to land a single proper interview. I didn’t do any internships because I didn’t know the job market would be this bad which I regret right now. I couldn’t afford to sit around waiting, so I’ve been working full-time in sales to pay the bills which makes it a bit harder for me since I don’t have a lot of free time to focus on job hunting and building projects.That said, I didn’t give up on tech. I’ve been learning on my own, building personal projects whenever I have a bit of free time, and I’ve also worked with a small agency on a project basis (not full-time) since late 2023.At this point I’m honestly burnt out and confused.

With benefits and bonus I'm just over 200k but I see all my peers at FAANG with the same YOE getting TC around 300k+. I've chalked up this difference to the stock options I receive being illiquid but even if we hit our goal IPO valuation (likely as we have a billionaire angel investor but it may take years) I'd be barely ahead of them in terms of total pay over the 5+ years of our overall career, while also having taken on far more risk. I'm considering attempting to make the jump into a bigger company to get some more upward growth options. The problem is that I hear the market is super competitive now so I'm not sure if its worth investing the time into getting back into interview shape. I'm also worried about burnout, since I am fully remote here and usually only go in-office twice a week for food. Big companies seem to be hard pushing RTO and I would miss being able to take work-cations around the world.With all that being said, do you guys think its the right career move to make the jump? I've been here since graduating almost 5 years ago and am starting to feel a bit stagnant. It's like golden handcuffs except instead of good TC the carrot is just a relaxed schedule and remote option which seems to be dwindling. Those of you who have made the transition from startups to big tech, was it difficult to get interviews and offers? Did you think it was the right move career-wise?",

I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.In particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.I get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.So how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company? And how many should be treated as signs to walk away?Would really appreciate any thoughts, heuristics, or personal experience. I’m trying to understand how to tell the difference between healthy chaos and exploitation / red flags to walk away from.",

I’ve been in a IT help desk role after graduating for 2 years now and I’ve been complacent but the job kinda sucks and pay sucks too and I’m never gonna move up anywhere staying here. I was thinking about getting the grind back and taking the time to relearn everything and work on some cs projects with friends.

Or am I safer to try to learn something new like cybersecurity? Maybe splunk and other certs? I’m really not sure what my direction for CS is right now.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.**((This part is just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \\~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't \"crazy\" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave, but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.All of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \\~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.I still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\\-----------------------------------------------------I know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",

Not even ORMs. We don't really roll our own infra, rarely we'll change an IAC config file somewhere. No gRPC. No real system design skills to speak of. Node+TS on the backend is also a weird place to be in this market where companies want you to fit to a T, it's in the intersection of front and backend.We basically get together, talk about the future states of some parts of the mobile app, get the data from downstream services and just add business logic so that our REST endpoints have XYZ fields. It's gotten too easy, I don't feel like I'm growing and I'm worried about the skills I have vs those I *should* have on paper. The current market is also making it hard to switch jobs to get more breadth/depth.

        "content": "I’m at a pretty stressful crossroads and could really use some guidance. I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.While I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.I’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.I feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.For those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?I know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.Any advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.Finally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",

Back in 2024 around the business end of the year, for around 5-6months I used to work for a travel startup where I was building their mvp. I was working their as a Full stack engineer (learning on the job). I have decent knowledge about backend too after my experience. But sadly around January the startup ceased it's operations and I have been jobless since. Currently I am doing freelance stuffs but I feel like I have hit a roadblock. I am stuck in this cycle of not learning new things.With these rapid development of AI coming in I get to hear this a lot that \"it's imperative software Dev's have their fundamentals clear\". And I somehow feel my fundamentals are weak. I wanted to ask how should I go back to the drawing board and strengthen up my fundamentals?I know I need to start the leetcode grind and system design too for getting a permanent job. But what should I be doing consistenly now so that it helps me become a better engineer/developer/programmer?I just don't want to be someone who does this just for the sake of doing it. I actually want to get better and develop a first principles thinking.",

        "content": "I'm considering planning around a career shift in \\~5 years to work towards being a professor in CS. My motivations are1. I really like school/learning and would enjoy getting my masters/doctorate.2. I enjoy teaching + tutoring. And I'm pretty good at it.3. I kinda hate the grind of industry.4. Summers off for my kids5. With an additional 5 years of industry pay I'll have a NW large enough to coast for a very long time on reduced income. Then hopefully in \\~10 years I'll be established enough as a professor to make more money within that fieldDownsides1. Industry pays way way more, duh. Average in the cost of school + opportunity cost of not working it's *way way way* more.2. From what I understand, new professors actually just get kicked around as an adjunct for many years and basically treated like studentsI have \\~8 years in industry and have worked for some big names like Google and Amazon which I suppose could help get some early career movement as a professor. Anyone done this? Any additional insight?",

        "content": "My current company is doing layoffs. I've been told by my direct boss I have a very low chance of being laid off based on my high performance and my recent promotion. Base: 110k Bonus: 20k. Fully remote with no chance of going back in.Because of the layoff announcement I started looking two weeks ago and got an offer at 150k. Bonus is up for debate, but supposedly around 10% of the base. Hybrid 3 days in office. The tech stack is different from my normal one, I've always worked heavy backend java, this would be full stack with C++. I'm fine learning a new stack and front end, and the pay seems good, assuming the bonus can be confirmed. But the 3 days in seems rough. I've never had the displeasure of going into an office before (5 YOE). Always fully remote. If my current job wasnt threatening layoffs I wouldn't consider this at all realistically. To be honest I'm dog shit at interviewing, and I hate leet code, and I almost never get responses from apps, this seemed like a fluke. Additional info: my current company has assigned us 3 new offshore teams, who have taken around 60% of our old workload. We've focused on new things, and have work flowing, but it seems like the goal is for the offshore teams to take more as time passes.Am I being stupid not just taking the confirmed job? It seems unlikely they'd lay me off after just hiring me.",

My responsibilities include designing and implementing the backend, managing and designing the cloud infrastructure, and handling some DevOps tasks. Basically, I’m managing everything related to the backend on my own.The problem is that I’m the only one experienced in these areas no one else really understands what I’m doing. As a result, I don’t get any feedback or code reviews, and I have no one to learn from. I’m completely on my own, heck we don't even have anyone to test my code.Lately, I feel like I’m just freestyling. I worry this might put me behind others in the industry, because all my experience comes from reading articles. I’m not even sure if I’m doing things the right way.Note: it’s startup",
