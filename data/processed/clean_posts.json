And I know that my team will be held responsible for these errors, even though their use is imposed and they are inevitable.Here are a few examples that we are working on across the team and that are currently suffering from this:* Data Extraction from PDFs/Websites: We used to use a case-by-case approach with things like regex, keywords, and stopwords, which was highly reliable. Now, we're using LLMs that are more flexible but make many more mistakes.* Fuzzy Matching: Matching strings, like customer names, was a deterministic process. LLMs are being used instead, and they're less accurate.* Data Categorization: We had fixed rules or supervised models trained for high-accuracy classification of products and events. The new LLM-based approach is simply less precise.The technology we had before was accurate and predictable. This new direction is trading reliability for perceived innovation, and the business is suffering for it. The board doesn't want us to apply specific solutions to specific problems anymore; they want the magical LLM black box to solve everything in a generic way.",

Most of them connect to internal apps with APIs, I clean and enrich the data and save it into a CSV on the network drive. Then connect an excel file (no BI licenses) to the CSV with PowerQuery just to load the clean data to the data model and then Pivot Table it out and add graphs and such. Some of them come from Excel files that are mostly consistent. All this on an IT support payrate! They do let me do plenty of overtime to focus on this, and high ranking people on the company are bringing me into meetings for me to help them solve issues with data.I know my current setup is unsustainable, CSVs on a share and Python scripts on my windows Desktop have been usable so far... but if they keep assigning me more work or to scale it to other locations I'm gonna have to do something else.The company is pretty old school as far as tech goes, and to them I'm just \"good at Excel \" because they don't realize how involved the work actually is.

I can prompt an LLM, get something 80% of the way there, and then refine it to fit the exact need. It’s massively boosted my productivity.That said, I sometimes worry I’m not building the same depth of understanding I would if I were digging through docs or troubleshooting syntax from scratch. But with the pace and volume of work I’m expected to handle, using LLMs feels necessary.As I think about the next step in my career, I’m curious: how do senior data engineers view this approach? Is leveraging LLMs seen as smart and efficient, or does it raise concerns about foundational knowledge and long-term growth?Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who mentor or manage junior engineers.",

We need to build a data warehouse to track sales performance, inventory levels, and product information. Data comes from multiple sources and has different update frequencies.Data DescriptionYou are provided with the following data points: * Product Information (updated daily): * product_id (unique identifier) * product_name * category (e.g., Electronics, Apparel) * supplier_id * supplier_name * unit_price (the price can change over time) * Sales Transactions (streamed in real-time): * order_id * product_id * customer_id * order_timestamp * quantity_sold * sale_price_per_unit * shipping_address (city, state, zip code) * Inventory Levels (snapshot taken every hour): * product_id * warehouse_id * stock_quantity * snapshot_timestampRequirementsDesign a dimensional data warehouse model that addresses the following: * Data Model Design: * Create a star or snowflake schema with fact and dimension tables to store this data efficiently. * Your model must handle changes in product prices over time (Slowly Changing Dimensions). * The design must accommodate both real-time sales data and hourly inventory snapshots. * Schema Definition: * Define the tables with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and constraints. * Data Processing Considerations: * Explain how your model supports analyzing historical sales with the product prices that were active at the time of sale. * Describe how to handle the different granularities of the sales (transactional) and inventory (hourly snapshot) data.Deliverables * A complete Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrating your proposed data model. * SQL DDL statements for creating all tables, keys, and indexes. * A written explanation detailing: * The reasoning behind your modeling choices (e.g., why you chose a specific SCD type). * The trade-offs you considered. * How your model enables key business queries, such as \"What was the total revenue by product category last month?\" and \"What is the current inventory level for our top 10 selling products?\" * Your recommended indexing strategy to optimize query performance. Section 3: Architectural Design ChallengeBusiness ContextAn e-commerce company wants to implement a new product recommendation engine on its website. To power this engine, the data team needs to capture user behavior events, process them, and make the resulting insights available for both real-time recommendations and analytical review.Requirements:1. Design a complete data architecture to: * Collect Event Data:Track key user interactions: product_view, add_to_cart, purchase, and product_search.Ensure data collection is reliable and can handle high traffic during peak shopping seasons.The collection mechanism should be lightweight to avoid impacting website performance.* Process and Enrich Data:Enrich raw events with user information (e.g., user ID, session ID) and product details (e.g., category, price) from other company databases.Transform the event streams into a structured format suitable for analysis and for the recommendation model.Support both a real-time path (to update recommendations during a user's session) and a batch path (to retrain the main recommendation model daily).* Make Data Accessible:Provide the real-time processed data to the recommendation engine API.Load the batch-processed data into a data warehouse for the analytics team to build dashboards and analyze user behavior patterns.Ensure the solution is scalable, cost-effective, and has proper monitoring.2. Deliverables* Architecture Diagram: A detailed diagram showing all components (e.g., event collectors, message queues, stream/batch processors, databases) and data flows.* Technical Specifications:A list of the specific technologies/services you would use for each component and a justification for your choices.A high-level schema for the raw event data and the structured data in the warehouse.Your strategy for monitoring the pipeline and ensuring data quality.* Implementation Considerations:A brief discussion of how the architecture supports both real-time and batch requirements.Recommendations for ensuring the system is scalable and cost-effective.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm hoping some experienced folks can give some insight. I am a data engineer and architect who worked his way up from analytics engineer. I've built end-to-end pipelines that served data scientists, visualizations, applications, or other groups data platforms numerous times. I can do everything from the DataOps / MLOps to the actual analytics if needed (I have an academic ML background). I can also troubleshoot pipelines that see large volumes of users on the application end and my last technical role was as an architect/ reliability engineer consulting across many different sized companies.I've finally secured a more leadership-type position as the principal data strategist (I have no interest in being middle management leading technical groups). The issue is the company is in the construction sector and largely only uses Microsoft365. There is some Azure usage that is currently locked down by IT and they won't even give me read-only access. There is no one at the company who understands cloud concepts or software engineering -- the Azure env is set up from consoles, there is no versioning (like no Git let alone Yaml), and the CIO doesn't even understand containers. The engineers vibe code and if they need an application demo for a client, they'll vibe the python and use Streamlit and put it on a free public server.I'm honestly beside myself and don't know what to do about the environment in general. IT is largely incompetent when it comes to any sort of modern practices and there's a lot of nepotism so no one gets fired and if you aren't related to someone, you're shit out of luck.I'm trying to figure out what to do here. Pros: \\- I have the elevated title so I feel like that raises me to a different \"social level\" as I find higher leaders are now wanting to engage with me on LinkedIn \\- Right now I kind of have a very flexible schedule and can decide how I want to structure my day. That is very different from other roles I've been in that had mandatory standups and JIRAs and all that jazz \\- This gives me time to think about pet projects.\\- Adding a pro I forgot to add -- there is room for me to kind of learn this type of position (more leadership, less tech) and make mistakes. There's no one else gunning for this position (they kind of made it for me) so I have no fear of testing something out and then having it fail -- whether that's an idea, a communication style, a long term strategy map, etc. They don't know what to expect from me honestly so I have the freedom to kind of make something up. The fear is that nothing ends up being accepted as actionable due to the culture of not wanting to change processes.Cons: \\- I'm paid 'ok' but nothing special. I gave up a $40k higher salary when I took this position. \\- There is absolutely no one who can talk about modern software. It's all vibe coders who try to use LLMs for everything. There is absolutely no structure to the company either -- everyone is silo'ed and everyone does what they want so there's just random Python notebooks all over Sharepoint, random csv files where ever, etc \\- The company is very old school so everything is Microsoft365. I can't even get a true Azure playground. if I want to develop on the cloud, I'll need to buy my own subscription. I'm forced to use a PC. \\- I feel like it's going to be hard to stay current, but I do have colleagues to talk to from previous jobs who are current and intelligent. \\- My day to day is extremely frustrating because no one understands software in the slightest. I'm still trying to figure out what I can even suggest to improve their data issues. There are no allies since IT is so locked down (I can't even get answers to questions from them) and their leader doesn't understand cloud or software engineering. Also no one at the company wants to change their ways in the slightest.Right now my plan is: (this is what I'm asking for feedback on) \\- Try to make it here at least 2 years and use the elevated title to network -- I suck at networking though so can you give some pointers? \\- use this time to grow my brand. Post to Medium, post to LinkedIn about current topics and any pet projects I can come up with. \\- Take some MBA level courses as I will admit that I have no business background and if I want to try to align to business goals, I have to understand how businesses (larger businesses) work. \\- Try to stay current -- this is the hard one -- I'm not sure if I should just start paying out the nose for my own cloud playground? My biggest shortcoming is never building a high volume streaming pipeline end-to-end. I understand all the tech and I've designed such pipelines for clients, but have never had to build and work in one day to day which would reveal many more things to take into consideration. To do this on my own may be $$$. I will be looking for side consulting jobs to try to stay in the game as well. \\- I'm hoping that if I can stay just current enough and add in business strategy skills, I'd be a unique candidate for some high level roles? All my career people have always told me that I'm different because I'm a really intelligent person who actually has social skills (I have a lot of interesting hobbies that I can connect with others over).Or I could bounce, make $45k+ more and go back into a higher pressure, faster moving env as a Lead Data Architect/ engineer. I kind of don't want to do that bc I do need a temporary break from the startup world. If I wait and try to move toward director of data platform, I could make at least $75k more, but I guess I'm not sure what to do between now and then to make sure I could score that sort of title considering it's going to be REALLY hard to prove my strategy can create movement at this current company. I'm mostly scared of staying here and getting really far behind and never being able to get another position.",

        "title": "# Roast my project: DataCompose: I brought shadcn's copy-to-own pattern to pyspark - am I stupid?",
        "author": "nonamenomonet",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, sorry for the provocative title. I'd love to get some feedback on a project I've been working on. I was inspired by how full-stack developers use shadcn and shadcn-svelte (svelte is superior to react btw) with their \"copy-to-own\" pattern. I think this pattern could solve a common pain point in data engineering: most of us work in environments where adding new dependencies requires extensive justification. What if we could get the functionality we need without adding dependencies, while still owning and understanding every line of code?Here's how it works: [DataCompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose) maintains a registry of battle tested (read: aggressively unit tested) data cleaning primitives. The CLI copies these directly into your repo as plain PySpark code. No runtime dependencies, no magic. You can modify, extend, or completely rewrite them. Once the code is in your repo, you can even delete the CLI and everything still works.**Note**: The generated code assumes you already have PySpark set up in your environment. DataCompose focuses on providing the cleaning logic, not managing your Spark installation. ## Code Example ```bashdatacompose init# Generate email cleaning primitivesdatacompose add clean_emails --target pyspark# Generate address standardization primitives datacompose add clean_addresses --target pyspark# Generate phone number validation primitivesdatacompose add clean_phone_numbers --target pyspark``````pythonfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSessionfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F# Import the generated primitivesfrom build.pyspark.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails# Create Spark sessionspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"DataCleaning\").getOrCreate()# Load your datadf = spark.read.csv(\"data.csv\", header=True)# Apply email transformationscleaned_df = df.withColumn( \"email_clean\", emails.standardize_email(F.col(\"email\"))).withColumn( \"email_domain\", emails.extract_domain(F.col(\"email_clean\"))).withColumn( \"is_valid\", emails.is_valid_email(F.col(\"email_clean\")))# Filter to valid emails onlyvalid_emails = cleaned_df.filter(F.col(\"is_valid\"))````I wanted to bring some of Svelte's magic to this, so my personal favorite way to do data transformations is like this:```pythonfrom build.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails# Create a comprehensive email cleaning pipeline@emails.compose()def clean_email_pipeline(email_col): # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc) email = emails.fix_common_typos(email_col) # Standardize the email (lowercase, trim whitespace) email = emails.standardize_email(email) # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing if emails.is_gmail(email): email = emails.normalize_gmail(email) # Validate and mark suspicious patterns is_valid = emails.is_valid_email(email) is_disposable = emails.is_disposable_domain(email)# Apply the pipeline to your dataframedf = df.withColumn(\"email_results\", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(\"raw_email\")))```Or you can do it like this (like a normie):```pythondef clean_email_pipeline(col): # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc) col = emails.fix_common_typos(col) col = emails.standardize_email(col) # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing if emails.is_gmail(col): col = emails.normalize_gmail(col) return coldf = df.withColumn(\"email_results\", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(\"raw_email\")))```## Key Features- **Composable Primitives**: Build complex transformations from simple, reusable functions- **Smart Partial Application**: Configure transformations with parameters for reuse- **Pipeline Compilation**: Convert declarative pipeline definitions into optimized Spark operations- **Code Generation**: Generate standalone PySpark code with embedded dependencies- **Comprehensive Libraries**: Pre-built primitives for emails, addresses, and phone numbers- **Conditional Logic**: Support for if/else branching in pipelines- **Type Safe Operations**: All transformations maintain Spark column type safety## Why This Approach?- **You Own Your Code**: No external dependencies to manage or worry about breaking changes- **Full Transparency**: Every transformation is readable, debuggable PySpark code you can understand- **Customization First**: Need to adjust a transformation? Just edit the code## I AM LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK !!!! I WANT TO KNOW IF I AM CRAZY OR NOT!Currently supporting three primitive types: addresses, emails, and phone numbers. More coming based on YOUR feedback.**Playground Demo**: [github.com/datacompose/datacompose-demo](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose-demo) **Main Repo**: [github.com/datacompose/datacompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose)",

        "content": "Hey everyone, author here. We just published a piece exploring the idea of an ORM for analytical databases, and I wanted to share it with this community specifically.The core idea is that while ORMs are great for OLTP, extending a tool like Prisma or Drizzle to OLAP databases like ClickHouse is a bad idea because the semantics of core concepts are completely different.We use two examples to illustrate this. In OLTP, columns are nullable by default; in OLAP, they aren't. unique() in OLTP means write-time enforcement, while in ClickHouse it means eventual deduplication via a ReplacingMergeTree engine. Hiding these differences is dangerous.What are the principles for an OLAP-native DX? We propose that a better tool should:* Borrow the best parts of ORMs (schemas-as-code, migrations).* Promote OLAP-native semantics and defaults.* Avoid hiding the power of the underlying SQL and its rich function library.We've built an open-source, MIT licensed project called Moose OLAP to explore these ideas.Happy to answer any questions or hear your thoughts/opinions on this topic!",

        "content": "I started working at a pretty respected company about three years ago. There was never really a proper learning pathway here. It is more of a watch and try to do it yourself type of setup. Over time I have built a decent number of reports and have become one of the few people on the team who consistently does actual work. Out of a team of 10 it feels like only about three of us really contribute. Honestly it is kind of crazy.The biggest issue I am dealing with is the most senior guy on the team. For some reason he seems to have it out for me. I have taken feedback from plenty of stakeholders without any problem. They treat me with respect. But this guy is never happy with anything I do. I can follow his instructions exactly and he still finds something to criticise. He has even called me names in front of the team and regularly insults my work. I am not claiming to be the best data engineer in the world but I do put in the effort. Meanwhile there are people on the team who have not done real work in months yet he treats them like gold.The tricky part is that despite how he treats me he is the only person I can really go to for help because he knows everything. The problem is if he is wrong about something he will just double down and act like he is right. For example last week he claimed we could not use Power BI for a report because the stakeholder’s PC could not handle it even though I am pretty sure most of the heavy lifting is done by PowerBI.com.The team has been together for over 30 years so even if I went to HR I doubt anyone would back me up. And the newer people would not want to stir the pot since they have it easy getting paid for doing almost nothing.I have mentioned my concerns to my line manager and he says that I am being to sensitive to the feedback on my work and its just how the guy is. There may be some truth to that, but its kinda hard to take feedback when every other comment is laced with a snide/condescending comment Some of the team members say that he's been talking about me on calls for hours after I leave, and I told him that it makes me feel like I am not safe here, to which he said \"That's because you are not safe x\" and the entire call went silent. I also kinda wanted to ask if anyone had gone down the HR path before with this kinda problem? any advice appreciated",

SCD2 would mean custom dbt jobs, adding cost and complexity.Airbyte is quite flexible and there’s an open source advantage but maintaining connectors and building masking/SCD2 feels is too much DIY work.Looking for advice:- Is Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? Any other alternative setups that we can pilot?- Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it?- Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2?- If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes?Ok this post went long.

Democratizing our data reporting in this way has been a huge time-saver for me, and we're slowly cutting down on the number of custom report requests we get from users and other departments because they realize they already have access to what they need. Big win. Maybe AI-generated reports could increase this time savings if it were offered as a tool to data consumers? * Has anyone had experience using AI to *effectively* handle any of the reporting steps? * Report generation seems like one of those fiddly things where AI could be used - does it do better for cosmetic changes to reporting than it does for field mapping and/or generating calculated fields? * Any advice on how to incorporate AI so that it's actually time-saving and not a new headache?",

We're all convinced we're right (obviously), so I thought I'd throw it to the Reddit hive mind.Here's the scenario: We need to get our data into this third-party tool. They've given us four options:1. **API key integration** – We build the connection on our end, push data to them via their API2. **Direct database connector** – We give them credentials to connect directly to our DB and they pull what they need3. **Secure file upload** – We dump files into something like S3, they pick them up from there4. **Something else entirely** – Open to other suggestionsI'm leaning towards option 1 because we keep control, but my teammate reckons option 2 is simpler. Our security lead is having kittens about giving anyone direct DB access though.Which would you go for and why? Bonus points if you can explain it like I'm presenting to the board next week!**Edit:** This is for a mid-size company, nothing too sensitive but standard business data protection applies.",

Everytime I ask for clarifying questions all i get in response is another question. Nobody is willing to be assertive and I have to reach out to my manager for every small details pertaining to business logic. Thankfully my manager is helful in such scenarios. Technically team mates lack lots of skills,they once laughed that nobody knows SQL on the team to which I was flabbergasted. They certainly lack skills in docker, kubernetes, general database, networking concepts and even basic unit testing, sometimes its really trivial stuff. Now thanks to copilot they are atleast able to sort it out but it really takes considerable time that just keeps delaying our project. Some of the updates that I get in daily stand ups are quite ridiculous like \"I am updating the tables in a database\" for almost 2 weeks which is basically 1 table with regular append. Code is copy pasta from other code bases when I question their implementation i am directed to a different code base from where it was copied and let original author take the responsibility. Lot of times meetings get hijacked by some very trivial things, Saying a bunch of hypothetical things but adding nothing of value.Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. Is this how a normal functioning team looks like? How do you deal with such team members? Sometimes I feel I should just ignore which i do to a degree when it does not impact my work but then ultimately it is causing delays in delivering the project which is very much doable within the timelines. There is definitely atleast 1 person on the team who is a complete misfit for a data engineering role however for god knows why they choose that person. It does seem like typical corporate BS where people portray they are doing a lot when they are not. Apologies for the rant but like I said sometimes it really gets on my nerves with the way this team operates.Just looking for tips how to tackle such members/culture and should some of this \"in efficiencies\" be called out to my manager?",

They came and built us Medallion layers (BRONZE, SILVER, AND GOLD plus a WORK and COMMON area) with 4 environments ( DEV, QA, STG and PROD) in a single account. There are 15 databases involved, one for each environment/layer for example: COMMON_DEV, BRONZE_DEV, SILVER_DEV, GOLD_DEV, and WORK_DEV...for each environment.We discussed what objects we needed permissions on and they built us a stored procedure that creates a new schema, roles and grants the appropriate permissions. We have a schema per client approach and access roles at the schema level.They left with little to no documentation on the process. As I started migrating clients into the new schemas I found issues, I created views in GOLD that reference SILVER and the views are failing because they do not have access.I talked with Snowflake and they are helping with this but said is by design and medallion layers do not have this type of access. They are being very helpful with meeting our \"new requirements\".... This is where I need some assistance. Please correct me if I am wrong, but isnt it medallion layers architecture 101 that views work across layers... I didn't think this would have to be explicitly stated upfront in a statement of work. How have you seen solutions architected to ensure separation of layer but allow for views to read across layers?",

We have a basic UI that is built using retool. This UI handles users upto 1000 (light weight operations), and it currently uses dynamoDb as its backend. We are planning to move to Azure in future, so wondering which back end database would be a good choice. Our top options are Postgres and mongoDb. Postgres is less expensive, and offers good features of a traditional transactional database.However, dynamoDb to Postgres migration would require a lot of functional changes as we move from a Nosql to an RDS. Could someone please weigh in like pros and cons of these two?Another unusual idea floated was - using data bricks as the backend for the UI. Though I am not a fan of this idea only because of the fact that Databricks is an analytical database, not sure how it might handle concurrency of UI application. But, I might be wrong here, is Databricks good at handling these concurrent requests with low-latency ? Need everyone’s valuable opinion here.Thanks in advance.",

The author also shared this idea in his \"Turning the database inside-out\" talkThis journey convinces me that stream processing is not only suitable for data analysis pipelines but also for building high-performance, consistent backend services.I am curious about your industry experience from the data engineer perspective.DDIA was published in 2017, but from my limited observation in 2025* In Taiwan, stream processing is generally not a required skill for seeking backend jobs.* I worked in a company that had 1000(I guess?) backend engineers across Taiwan, Singapore, and Germany. Most services use RPC to communicate.* In system design tutorials on the internet, I rarely find any solution based on stateful stream processing.Is there any reason this architecture is not adopted widely today?

He then asked me very basic statistical questions and i was able to answer 1.5 out of 4 (i wasn't prepared at all for this part). He then asked me the famous same 5 row same value question and asked for different joins. I answered it wrong and was so annoyed with myself because i didn't think properly and i knew the answer. Even for the second SQL question, i had messed up a bit wrt to basics because i wasn't thinking properly because of pressure. I might have given him the impression that i am weak wrt to basics. Don't think i am moving ahead to the next round despite solving 200+ SQL problems. We keep trying! PS : The interviewer was such a nice guy. Gave honest feedback and told me ways i could improve",

        "author": "gloritown7",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks, Crossposting here from r/python. I have a pretty general question about best practices in regards to **creating ETL pipelines with python**. My usecase is pretty simple - download big chunks of data (at least 1 GB or more), decompress it, validate it, compress it again, upload it to S3. Now my initial though was doing asyncio for downloading > asyncio.queue > multiprocessing > asyncio.queue > asyncio for uploading to S3. However it seems that this would cause a lot of pickle serialization to/from multiprocessing which doesn't seem the best idea.Besides that I thought of the following: * multiprocessing shared memory - if I read/write from/to shared memory in my asyncio workers it seems like it would be a blocking operation and I would stop downloading/uploading just to push the data to/from multiprocessing. That doesn't seem like a good idea.* writing to/from disk (maybe use mmap?) - that would be 4 operations to/from the disk (2 writes and 2 reads each), isn't there a better/faster way?* use only multiprocessing - not using asyncio could work but that would also mean that I would \"waste time\" not downloading/uploading the data while I do the processing although I could run another async loop in each individual process that does the up- and downloading but I wanted to ask here before going down that rabbit hole :))* use multithreading instead? - this can work but I'm afraid that the decompression + compression will be much slower because it will only run on one core. Even if the GIL is released for the compression stuff and downloads/uploads can run concurrently it seems like it would slower overall.I'm also open to picking something else than Python if another language has better tooling for this usecase, however since this is a general high IO + high CPU usage workload that requires sharing memory between processes I can imagine it's not the easiest on any runtime.",

When these inputs are queried from the destination database, do you typically read from the replica knowing that you will be writing to the primary, or do you just run your SELECT statement against the primary?It seems the safest pattern in terms of reducing resource contention and locking, particularly when you are running parallel jobs that write to the same group of tables, would be the former option.

        "content": "Hello.I work as a PM in a small company and recently the management asked me for a set of BI dashboards to help them make informed decisions. We use Google Workspace so I think the best option is using Looker Studio for data visualization. Right now we have some simple reports to allow the operations team to download real-time information from our database (AWS RDS) since they lack SQL or programming skills. The thing is these reports are connected directly to our database so the data transformation occurs directly in Looker Studio, sometimes using complex queries affects the performance causing some reports to load quite slowly.So I've been thinking maybe it's the right time for setting up a Data Warehouse. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea since our database is small (our main table storages transactions and is roughly 50.000 rows and 30 MiB). It'll obviously grow, but I wouldn't expect it to grow exponentially.Since I want to use Looker Studio, I was thinking on setting up a pipeline that replicates the database in real time using AWS DMS or something, transfer the data to Google BigQuery for transformation (I don't know what the best tool would be for this) and then use Looker Studio for visualization. Do you think this is a good idea, or would it be better to set up the data warehouse entirely in AWS and then use a Looker Studio connector to create the dashboards?What do you think?",

Basically they store values like USD 123.45 as a string-typed triplet (12345,2,USD) so (value,scale,currency).It's practical for backend engineers given their codebase and it makes their computations faster (int operations) and safer (regarding float precision in Python). But on the data engineering side, when loading the data, we have to parse all these columns (there are a lot). We also have some internal tool directly reading their databases so we also have to do parsing on the go inside already complex queries.I have read some articles about custom types in PostgreSQL who say to avoid it as much as possible because of that. I wasn't in the company when they decided to go this way with numeric type but apparently the main argument was PostgreSQL decimal types are not precise enough, though I've used Decimal(38,18) in the past and it was very fine.What's your opinion on it ?

We all have probably heard about this [cost centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_centre_(business)) vs. [profit centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_center) and how this is \"safer\" as a software engineer to work in a profit centre, as you produce revenue and not cost.I have been thinking about that for years. I have one main ambiguity regarding that distinction: Every cost centre can be someone else's profit centre no? If we stick strictly to this definition, then the only safe place to work is more or less in the consulting business, where you charge for your hours. Maybe also businesses that sell the actual software. For example, in Google, is every unit a cost centre except the Ads department (and a few others)?Then also:1. If I'm a data engineer (hence this sub) writing the data pipeline to support the sales/support division, am I in a cost centre? 2. If I write internal software for other units within our org, including the traditional \"profit centres\", do I have no role in the profit making? 3. If I maintain the monitoring pipeline, ensuring availability of our (chargeable) service, is it pure cost?4. What if I maintain the web portal of a car sale business? Or the AI-based voice assistant of a healthcare provider?5. Is every IT work in a bank a cost centre?There are many more example. Maybe including R&D work, data science, etc..What do you think? Does this distinction still hold, now that IT is not a luxury or \"nice to have\" feature?Many thanks",

I saved a few days of work of figuring out intricacies of the task. Just gave the parameters (removed a bug in the macro along the way) and voilla.So the lesson here is if your case can fit a known algorithm, make it fit.

Although it's capable of acting as a client for ADX or ApplicationInsights, it's main role is to allow data-analysis of local files.Main features:* Can work with CSV,TSV,JSON,PARQUET,XLSX and text files* Able to work with large datasets (>50M rows)* Built in charting support for rendering results.* Plugin mechanism to allow you to create your own commands or KQL functions. (you need to be familiar with C#)* Can export charts and tables to powerpoint for report automation.* Type-inference for filetypes without schemas.* Cross-platform - windows, mac, linuxAlthough it doesn't implement the complete KQL operator/function set, the functionality is complete enough for most purposes and I'm continually adding more.It's rowscan-based engine so data import is relatively fast (no need to build indices) and while performance certainly won't be as good as a dedicated DB, it's good enough for most cases. (I recently ran an operation that involved a lookup from 50M rows to a 50K row table in about 10 seconds.) Here's a screenshot to give an idea of what it looks like...https://preview.redd.it/a7ao1fepukjf1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4760e0ad82ef67e55b845c48fcee34489041690Anyway if this looks interesting to you, feel free to download at [NeilMacMullen/kusto-loco: C# KQL query engine with flexible I/O layers and visualization](https://github.com/NeilMacMullen/kusto-loco)",

Requestor IP address or private network id,* *, must be included in allowed network rules. For more information on network rules refer to:* [*https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-network-rule*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-network-rule)*.*I would rather not have to update the policy every time my IP changes. Would the best practice here be to create a service user or apply the permissioning on a different level? I'm new to the security stuff so any insight around best practices here would be helpful for me. Thanks!",

        "content": "Hey community, I'm building an AI workflow for an internal tool and would appreciate some advice, as this is my first time working with something like that. My background is DevOps not AI so please excuse any ignorant question.Our company has a programming tool for controlling sorting robots, where workflows are defined in a YAML file. Each step in the workflow is a block that can execute a CLI tool.. I am using an LLM (Gemini 2.5 pro) to automatically generate these yaml files from a simplified user prompt (build a workflow to sort red and green cubes). Currently we have around 1000 internal helper CLIs for these tasks so no LLM knows about them.My current approach:Since the LLM has no knowledge of our interna CLI tools, I've come up with this two-stage process which is reecommend everywhere:1. **Stage 1** The users prompt is sent to an LLM. Its task is to formulate questions for a vector database (which contains all our CLI tool man pages) to figure out which specific tools are needed to fulfill the users request, and which flags to use.2. **Stage 2** The man page (or sections) retrieved in the first stage is then passed to a second LLM call, along with the original user prompt and instructions on how to structure the YAML. This stage generates the final output.So here is my problem or lack of understanding:For the first stage, how can I help the LLM to generate the right search queries for a vector database and select the right CLI tools from over these 1000? Should it also generate questions at this first stage to find the right flags for each CLI tool?Is providing the LLM with a simple list of all CLI tool names and a one-line description for each the best way to start? I'm not sure how it would know to ask the right questions about specific flags, arguments, and their usage without more basic context. But I also can't provide it with 1000 basic descriptions? Gemini has a large attention window but I mean its still a lot.For the second stage, I'm not sure what is the best way to provide the retrieved docs to the generator LLM. I've two options I believe?* **Option A: entire manpage** For each CLI tool chosen by he first LLM I pass in the entire man page. A workflow could have 10 manpages or even more, so I would pass 10 entire man pages to the second stage, that feels overkill. This for sure contains all info to the LLM but its enourmous and the token count is through the roof, and the LLM might even loose attention?* **Option B: chunks** I could generate smaller more targeted chunks of the man pages and add them to the Vector database. This would help with my token problem but I also feel this might miss important context since the LLM has 0 knowledge about these tools.So I am not sure if I identified the right problems, or if the problem I have is actually a different one. Can anyone help me understand this more? Thanks a lot!",

AI seems very hyped right now, but also possibly oversaturated with talent. On the other hand, data engineering feels like a field with growing demand, since every AI/ML system ultimately relies on strong data pipelines and infrastructure.Some questions I’d love to hear your opinions on:* Do you think the AI job market is already too saturated for new graduates?* Is data engineering a safer bet in terms of long-term career stability?* Which field do you think offers more opportunities for growth in the next 5–10 years?* For someone who enjoys both coding and system design, would data engineering be a better fit than AI research?Any personal experiences, advice, or resources would be really appreciated!Thanks in advance",

Regarding things like permissions and row-level security (RLS), are contracts only used to verify that these are enforced, or can the contract actually be used to create them? 3. Is OpenMetadata/DataHub just an observability tool, or can it stop a pipeline that is failing a data quality step?Sorry if I'm a bit lost in this data metadata world.",

For backstory, I’ve got a synapse analytics subscription, along with an Azure sql server.I’ve imported a bunch of csv data into the data lake, and now I want to transform it and store it in the data warehouse.Something isn’t quite clicking for me yet though. I’m not sure where I’m meant to store all the intermediate steps between raw data -> processed data (there is a lot of filtering and cleaning and joining I need to do). Like how do I pass data around in memory without persisting it?Normally I would have a bunch of different views and tables to work with, but in Synapse I’m completely dumbfounded.1) Am I supposed to read from the csv’s do some work then write it back to a csv in the lake?2) should I be reading from the csvs, doing a bit of merging, writing to the Azure SQL db? 3) Should I be using a dedicated SQL pool instead?Interested to hear everyone’s thoughts about how you use Azure Synapse for DW!",

        "content": "I started my job as a \"data engineer\" almost a year ago. The company I work for is pretty weird, and I'd bet most of the work I do is not quite relevant to your typical data engineer. The layman's way of describing it would be a data wrangler. I essentially capture data from certain sources that are loosely affiliated with us and organize them through pipelines to transform them into useful stuff for our own warehouses. But the tools we use aren't really the industry standard, I think?I mostly work with Python + Polars and whatever else might fit the bill. I don't really work with spark, no cloud whatsoever, and I hardly even touch SQL (though I know my way around it). I don't work on a proper \"team\" either. I mostly get handed projects and complete it on my own time. Our team works on two dedicated machines of our choice. They're mostly identical, except one physically hosts a drive that is used as an NFS drive for the other (so I usually stick to the former for lower latency). They're quite beefy, with 350G of memory each, and 40 processors each to work with (albeit lower clock speeds on them).I'm not really sure what counts as \"big data,\" but I certainly work with very large datasets. Recently I've had to work with a particularly large dataset that is 1.9BB rows. It's essentially a very large graph network, with 2/2 columns being nodes, and the row representing an outgoing edge from column\\_1 to column\\_2. I'm tasked with taking this data, identifying which nodes belong to our own data, and enhancing the graph with incoming connections as well. e.g., a few connections might be represented likeA->BA->CC->Bwhich can extrapolate to incoming connections like soB<-AB<-CA<-CWell, this is really difficult to do, despite the theoretical simplicity. It would be one thing if I just had to do this once, but the dataset is being updated daily with hundreds of thousands of records. These might be inserts, upserts, or removals. I also need to produce a \"diff\" of what was changed after an update, which is a file containing any of the records that were changed/inserted.My solution so far is to maintain two branches of hive-partitioned directories - one for outgoing edges, the other for incoming edges. The data is partitioned on a prefix of the root node, which ends up making it workable within memory (though I'm sure the partition sizes are skewed for some chunks, the majority fall under 250K in size). Updates are partitioned on the fly in memory, and joined to the main branches respectively. A diff dataframe is maintained during each branch's update, which collects all of the changed/inserted records. This entire process takes anywhere from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the update size. And for some reason, the reverse edge updates take 10 times as long or longer (even though the reverse edge list is already materialized and re-used for each partition merge). As if it weren't difficult enough, a change is also reflected whenever a new record is deemed to \"touch\" one of our own. This requires integrating our own data as an update across both branches, which simply determines if a node has one of our IDs added. This usually adds a good 20 minutes, with a grand total maximum runtime of 1.3 hours.My team does not work in a conventional sense, so I can't really look to them for help in this matter. That would be a whole other topic to delve into, so I won't get into it here. Basically I am looking here for potential solutions. The one I have is rather convoluted (even though I summarized it quite a bit), but that's because I've tried a ton of simpler solutions before landing on this. I would love some tutelage from actual DE's around here if possible. Note that cloud compute is not an option, and the tools I'm allowed to work with can be quite restricted. But please, I would love any tips for working on this. Of course, I understand I might be seeking unrealistic gains, but I wanted to know if there is a potential for optimization or a common way to approach this kind of problem that's better suited than what I've come up with.",

        "content": "I recently compared Duck Lake with Starrocks. I was surprised to see that Starrocks performed much better than Duklake+duckdbSome background on DuckDb - I have previously implemented DuckDb in a lambda to service download requests asynchronously- based on filter criteria selected from the UI, a query is constructed in the lambda and queries pre-aggregated parquet files to create CSVs. This works well with fairly compelx queries involving self joins, group by, having etc, for data size upto 5-8GB. However, given DuckDb's limitations around concurrency (multiple process can't read and write to the .DuckDb file at the same time), couldn't really use it in solutions designed with persistent mode. With DuckLake, this is no longer the case, as the data can reside in the object store, and ETL processes can safely update the data in DuckLake while being available to service queries. I get that comparison with a distributed processing engine isn't exactly a fair one- but the dataset size (SSB data) was ~30GB uncompressed- ~8GB in parquet. So this is right up DuckDb's alley. Also worth noting is that memory allocation to Starrocks BE nodes was ~7 GB per node, whereas DuckDb had around 23GB memory available. I was shocked to see DuckDb's in memory processing come short, having seen it easily outperform traditional DBMS like Postgres as well as modern engines like Druid in other projects.Please see the detailed comparison here-https://medium.com/@anigma.55/rethinking-the-lakehouse-6f92dba519dcLet me know your thoughts.",

I created a dag which 1. creates a list with \\[\"start\\_id\", \"end\\_id\"\\] (10k from 1st order to the last) to limit chunks, 2. queries chunks from SQL Server (by order\\_id, so every load is 10k orders or \\~120k rows) with MsSqlHook + df.get\\_pandas\\_df(\"select range of orders\"), 3. uses df.to\\_parquet for transformation4. load every transformed chunk to MinIO.

We have use cases where the schema of our tables are restricted due to the name and description of the columns giving too much information.The only solution I could come up with was leveraging AWS secrets and aliasing the columns at runtime. In this case, an approved developer would have to flatten out the source data and map the keys/column to the secret. For example, if colA is sensitive then we create a secret “colA” with value “fooA”.

I’m also doing what is equivalent to 20 hours a week at 150/hour for my mentors new consulting startup, the work is all deliverable based so I’m doing it all before and after the contract job to keep things ethical.My work life balance is ok but not awesome, I have time on weekends to go on trips but my weeks are pretty packed and the contract role wants me to be going into the office minimum twice a week which is fine but a little exhausting.My mentor approached me and has another gig that would pay 40 hours a week through this new consulting startup and he’s asking me to come on full time at this startup, still do the 20 hours I’m currently doing and then do these 40 hours at roughly 100/hour. The gig is for three months but there would likely be more work after the three months but obviously there’s zero guarantee.Contractor role doesn’t really have healthcare and no pto so it would be a raise per hour and since the work is deliverable based rather than a corporate 9-5 I’ll have more flexibility to take time off as long as my work is keeping up.I think this current contract gig is probably pretty stable, there was a round of layoffs recently but I’m on a pretty critical tech project so I could probably just coast here if I wanted to but it’s been made reasonably clear that fte conversions are gonna be on hold since the purse strings are held pretty close. It’s essentially a money printing machine as long as things go well enough.I’m 25, no kids so my gf, parents and friends are all telling me to full send it since on paper it’s more money, way better leadership and if it takes off I’m lining myself up to be the most senior consultant on the team but just looking for more opinions.",

        "author": "NumberNinjas_Game",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey all, I'm David and I'm a professional software developer who still loves coding, 20 years after graduating from college with my degree. I've earned my Bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering, my Masters in Computer Science, and I've worked across all industries: embedded ,web, automation and even making a few mobile games like my Number Ninjas game (on my profile). I'm starting with a little about me to not brag, but to a) give context on why my experience can be useful and b) to hopefully give you encouragement.As I'm sifting through the land of Reddit, I see this question come up so many times: should I learn to code? Follow on questions stem from the likes of \"is coding dead with AI,\" \"what programming language should I use\", \"Java or dotnet\", etc. Just this week with casual browsing, these all popped up on my feed. Let me break this up into parts:**1) Should I learn to code?**This is a problem that needs to be reframed at a deeper level involving your relationship with problems in life. There are two things we can encounter:1) Solving an existing problem2) Choosing better problems (or creating a good \"problem\") Think about the last time you were stuck on something. How motivated were you to fix it? When you hit roadblocks, did you just want to throw in the towel, or did you stick with it and feel REALLY good after making a breakthrough. Writing software isn't linear or not even always predictable. There will be good days. There will be days where things break, you have setbacks, and it may take WAY more time than you planned for. It requires patience, resilience and a strong mindset.I'll be honest with you. Coding is VERY polarizing. If you don't love it, you'll hate it. There really isn't much in between. Going back to problems in life, a big part of your success in life isn't living a problem-free life, but choosing better problems to have. Code is a weird dichotomy: you solve world problems by creating interesting, fun problems in the making. **2) Is coding dead with AI? Will it take my job?**There are many strong opinions on this. My personal one is that if you don't see AI as a companion versus a threat, you will be phased out. Like many things in life, mindset matters. I remember being out of shape and always being envious of people who \"seemed\" to have it \"easier\" by being in shape...until I put in the work and started crushing it myself. AI is no different. You will need to be more of a \"unicorn\" software developer these days that does \"more than their job\" used to be just a few years ago. Life has adapted quite a bit. It's faster and it's automated. You can either let it make you bitter or better. Use AI, embrace it. But also embrace the fact that AI is FAR from perfect. Make yourself irreplaceable in your craft by being \"that dev\" that understands the architectural limitations of AI today and how your solutions show why AI can't be solely relied on. Sure, you can't guarantee you'll never lose a job BUT you are in charge of your growth and becoming the best you can be. Heck, you can then make your own apps like I have with the help of AI. **3) What programming language should I use?**Very nuanced. Do you know what kind of job space you are looking at (mobile apps, security, etc)? Certain programming paradigms and even languages may be better or worse. Are you simply looking for an easy language? Sure, start with Python. My answer isn't the best or the right one for everyone, and that's the point: there's no perfect answer to this. You just need to dive into SOMETHING, write code ,make mistakes, and LEARN from them. It's just like when I was starting my math YouTube channel: instead of obsessing over making the first perfect video, many Youtubers talked about not overthinking it and to just build that muscle memory. DO SOMETHING!!! Java vs dotnet? I saw this question recently. I know both. I prefer dotnet. Why? I just do? I love the IDE I use and the tech stack a bit more (big fan of Rider IDE btw). But again, your choice may be different I hope this gives you some things to think about. Reframe those questions, really hone in on your relationship with problem solving, and just dive right in! All the best and God bless!Is your motivation simply money: I promise you, that's very fleeting and won't keep you entertained. I've met so many people, both in college and beyond, where they chased coding as the next big thing and the pay it provides, only to experience burnout and pivot entirely. Here's an interesting problem for you. Imagine I gave you 9 pennies and just one of the pennies weighs slightly more than the other pennies. You're given a weight scale where you can put any number of pennies on one side. One weigh means comparing the weight of the pennies on both sides and the scale will tell you some outcome: both sides way the same, the left side weighs more or the right. Each time you perform this measurement, that counts as a turn. Beginner programmer question: make an app to figure out which penny weighs the most. Given the assumption that penny exists, your program must ALWAYS choose the CORRECT penny. Does this problem sound fun to you? If you were to take a pause right now and try and figure it out, what's your experience (\"good\" frustration, annoyance, wanting to really figure this out)? A simple \"problem\" like this can tell you a lot about your relationship with problem solving, the heart of coding. Believe me, there are days I get frustrated trying to figure out what's wrong, but it's a \"good\" frustration. Once solved, I still get that joy 20 years later.Btw, bonus problem: can you guarantee that program takes as few turns as possible :)",

And what is ok to learn on the job?Two caveats before we dive into the question.1. I understand it's a really bad time for Juniors right now. I understand even Doctorate level people are looking for work unsuccessfully.2. I understand the journey never really ends, and the number of things you could learn is near infinite. That's what draws me to this field in the first place.With those understood I'm curious how much is enough for Junior Developers? I recently got to the last 4 interviewees for an entry level job and I was rejected for being weaker than the others on the technical side. So I know this isn't a normal time in software, I just want to know how far off I am.* I can build a REST API CRUD app in Javascript & Python.* I know the basics of environment management and I can set up Node, Express, Django, etc. in both languages.* I'm a little more proficient in Javascript understanding some of those runtimes and frameworks at a deeper level including styling with Tailwind & Bootstrap as well as using Node & AJAX to set up Asynchronous data management to recieve input from the user then display the JSON/XML.* I'm familiar with basics setting up logic in the REST API Routes such as using findOne to search by UUID so that you can set up a view page for each entry in your API.* I'm already using error handling with try/catch methods to look for errors and send to an error page.* I can use React to set up a vite project and use it to manage state dynamically.* I can deploy the app via my AWS EC2.* I'm proficient with Git & Version control with a couple dozen repositories and over 400 commits.I plan on doing some Unit Testing and getting more practice with my debugger next, but I'm feeling rejected after getting so close and hearing \"Not enough\"Edit: Since a couple people asked about education.I do have a college degree in Business Administration, and I did a 12 week 60+ hour weeks intensive co-op on the basics of web development. Do you think that would be sufficient? Or should I plan on getting a second major in my future.I grew up in a very poor area, and neither my high school or early college had a CS program. The place I transferred to had one, but by then, I was tunnel visioned on finishing. I fell in love with technology and programming about two years ago.",

The 4 distinct subtasks are:Learning on your own - Recognize that doing things on your own is also doing things the hard way;Finding resources - finding resources that you can trust, and that fit your level of expertise and style of learning;Protecting time - regular, distraction-free time to think;Learning the content itself - syntax, semantics, libraries, development tools, algorithms, style.For me, when learning a new programming language I like to know who invented the language, what their motivation was, and what books (or blogs or channels) they have written or recommend. In my experience the most productive developers were the most effective at getting help (before AI helpers became popular).",

I am familiar with HTML and CSS. Not my strong suit though. I’ve been practicing by making projects.

I’d like to learn JavaScript properly too (or at least some of it) before school starts, but my friend suggested I learn TypeScript instead.What's the difference between the two? And would using TypeScript in college be too different to using Javascript? (as I'm unsure if I'd even be allowed to use TypeScript, so idk if I should spend time learning it lol)Also, a little off-topic to this post (sorry), do you guys have any project ideas or libraries I could explore once I’ve finished learning HTML, CSS, and JS (or TS)? I’ve also learnt Python (up to O.O.P), so any ideas that combine Python with the other three would also be super helpful since I'd like to start building a portfolio of projects for the future while continuing to develop what I know so far.

I learned that bcrypt adds a random salt each time you hash a password, so even if two user have the same password it will produce different hashes for both of them.But then, how does `bcrypt.compare(password, hash)` actually verify the password later when user actually enters the password? If salt is randomly created even if for same password how can it verify the password entered after being stored in the database with the hashed password that DB contains. If the salt is random and different each time, how can it recreate the same hash to compare with the login password?I take time to search online and stumbled upon some explanations and I think bcrypt somehow ( I don't understand the how part as well ) stores the salt along with the hash string itself, then reuses it during comparison with the new password but I’m not 100% sure if I’ve understood it correctly and it feels like I haven't understand the core concept of this Bcrypt password hashing. Maybe I am going overthinking but I am just curious.Can someone explain this clearly (like step by step or maybe in simpler terms) or provide me a good mental model / resource to look up to?",

I want to get work that uses the skills I learned, specifically in low-level languages such as C, C++, or assembly, and leverages my knowledge of network security.After consulting with people who know more about the hiring process than I do, I was told that the projects I have on my resume are not sufficient evidence of said skills. Because of this, I have to work on projects that would resolve this issue. I was advised to volunteer for organizations that would need computer science skills. There are a couple of options I came up with independent of the career agent's advice, but upon their review they only gave encouragement:* Contribute to open source projects* Create an indie gameObviously the path towards creating an indie game is, at the high level, straightforward. In spite of this, such games require time and creativity to reach completion. For that reason I have decided that while it's an okay idea, it would be best if I expand my resume through more than one vector.* [https://up-for-grabs.net/#/](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)* [https://goodfirstissue.dev/](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)* [https://www.codetriage.com/](https://www.codetriage.com/)* [https://github.com/ravendevteam/betanet](https://github.com/ravendevteam/betanet)* [https://kernelnewbies.org/](https://kernelnewbies.org/) (NOTE: Subject is about developing patches to the linux kernel.)That leads me here. I have opened some sites for open source projects that require assistance in the links above. However, I am lost as to how I would be able to digest the requirements given to me in regards to what these projects want, and convert them into a list of chores for me to follow through on.So how would I accomplish that?I will not consider taking a minimum wage job to attempt to stabilize my finances. The effect it would have on my schedule would be irrecoverably debilitating, and it will not resolve my financial difficulties.

I also have other things to do for myself like studying more languages, they may cost 1-2 hours, it’s also a little hobby and I don’t want to lose it.So, how do you do? I want to hear more suggestions.programming 8 hours hears like spend a whole day, I can only achieve it when it’s a holiday.",

Similarly, in vanilla JS, I often wonder if using a class for, say, managing state or UI logic is overkill compared to just using functions.Would love to hear from those of you who have worked on production-level projects::backhand_index_pointing_right: Do you use classes regularly?:backhand_index_pointing_right: If so, where do they really shine in web development?Thanks in advance!",

They study for 3 years, while we have only 9 months, and many Co-op postings even ask for Master’s students!3- AI revolution, Much of the work that used to be done by interns is now being handled by AI.I feel really disappointed and I’m even considering switching to another program that isn’t as affected by AI and could provide a better entry point into the job market.",

There are a few coding extracurriculars I'm involved in but want to step up into a true leadership role. Extracurriculars is my main focus, my GPA, grades, and test scores are stellar, I just have to add that personal bit. Now, enough with the rambling. I'm struggling to code because I rely to much on AI to help me solve stuff and make projects. Anything I make doesn't seem authentic and I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything and learning to solve problems, and I seriously feel like a failure in the field I'm interested, and I'm also worried about future job prospects with AGI and replacement being potentially in the near future.

I need help, but I don't understand what to do, I really want to get good at programming, my dream one day is to be 10x, but I feel stupid and terrible at coding. What do I do? I'm sorry this is rambling but I'm seriously worried about my future. Thanks in advance!Edit: I have learned Java, C++ and Python, and do robotics and cs club. I just feel like I've only learned theory and such, not actually practical stuff.Edit2: Hey everyone, I just want to thank ALL of you, except that one guy who suggested vibe coding, for your advice and expertise in helping solve my problem. I feel much better now that I have a solid plan and advice from people who know their stuff. Cheers!",

Ie. The value of knowing the language is that it lets you apply it however you want. (for example, Winston Churchill used english in a different way than JK Rowling).A programming example is Larry Page. At least, according to Paul Graham, \"The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search.\"My question is: how much did you know when you built your domain knowledge? ie. what was the process like when you transitioned from \"learning programming\" --> \"solving problems\"?For example, my car could break down and I would know it can be solved, but don't know how. Whereas my friend would be able to solve it because he's watched videos to mod his own car -- I suppose the answer is learn whatever you need to solve the problem.Well, in that case, how do I build an operating system? I want to make the movie Her. I suppose now, it makes sense to use the OS book to build it.What if I want to build a trading platform for AIs? Ie. how do I make a bank for them?

        "content": "When I first started learning mobile development, all I could think about was getting my app out there. I went from zero to launch in a few months with a small freelance team, and honestly… I thought the hardest part was over.But a few weeks after launch, things started breaking crash reports piling up, some features stopped working after an iOS update, and a few SDKs I used were already outdated. I didn’t even know “app maintenance” was a whole thing.Now I’m trying to figure out how to handle post-launch care without hiring a full-time dev. Is it normal to budget monthly for maintenance, or do most indie devs just patch things when users complain?Would love to hear how others handle this. Do you have a system for updates and bug fixes, or is it more of a “fix it when it’s broken” approach?",

I initially thought it was a cookie configuration problem, trying various SameSite and secure combinations for cross-domain communication, but nothing worked. I then completely changed the authentication flow to a token-based approach where the backend sends the JWT in the response body, and the frontend stores it in localStorage. Even this new method isn't working on Apple devices. Has anyone faced a similar issue with iOS browsers where a token isn't being stored or sent correctly, even when not using cookies?

I’ve always been curious about low-latency systems, multithreaded programming, and how real-time trading platforms manage high-throughput workloads efficiently.To explore these topics hands-on, I built a mini trading engine in C++. It’s a simple simulation right now — it includes:* An order book with support for basic market and limit orders.* Matching logic for buy/sell orders.* A basic mean-reversion strategy (just for testing).* Multithreaded architecture: one thread ingests mock market data, another executes strategy logic.* Data structures optimized for quick access and low overhead.* Performance benchmark scores and graphs to showcase real performance.* Basic tests to make sure every build runs smoothly.It’s very much a work in progress and far from perfect, but building it has taught me a ton already about threading and performance bottlenecks in real-time systems.I don't have any idea how C++ code is written in a professional environment so I’d really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for what I could improve. Whether it’s around architecture, C++ patterns, or trading engine design principles — I’m all ears.Thanks in advance, please give my project a star if you like it![Link](https://github.com/ArjunXvarma/mini-quant-trading-engine) to the project.",

Each report can take 1-4 hours of work just for me to generate the final product.After a year of my side gig I thought, \"Wouldn't it be funny if I automated this.\"After two weeks of goofing around with Azure logic apps, I completely automated my job without knowing anything about coding except asking chat-gpt to write me snippets of python to plug in here and there. It was like assembling IKEA furniture with the lights off and lighting matches every once in a while...but I did it.There is an assembly line of data collectors down stream from me that take about 2-4 hours to harvest data via human eyeballs and brains to give me (they are paid separately), and then I take hours to write a report...now it is, click-done. I just need to refine the process a bit and make it into a data secure workflow.The only reason that I could do this is that I have thirty years of experience in the field, and I could write a seven page multistep comprehensive prompt to give to AI, and I have the ability to get in the flow and lose all touch with the outside world for 10 hours at a time (Thank you Oblivion and League of Legends!).The government currently pays for and processes 20 million of these reports every year. They probably shell out 300-500 bucks to the private contractor that I work for for each report. Every state has private contractors that generate these reports.I am equal parts euphorically exhilarated and \"Three Days of Condor\" paranoid.1. Do I need to learn Python now? If so, how? I am 60 years old, so state university classes are free for me.2. Could I just find another regular guy like me in the city where I live that is a python designer? If so, how?3. Is it possible for me to keep ownership of my idea? Can you patent an idiotically simple seven step azure work flow that has a two snippets of chat-gpt python code and two wildly complex AI prompts?(what subreddit is that?)4. How do I make this into a product or a business? (what subreddit is that?) 5. What else do I need to do before I buy a car with \"doors that go up like this\".6.

All I want is being the guy who does some sort of technical work.It’s been around 2 months since the decision. So far I spent most of my time on YouTube, mainly CS50 playlist + tutorials on HTML, CSS, JS, Python (bro code channel). On the practice side I tried writing the code tutor writes just to understand better.Also made a small site with HTML, little CSS, wrote some JS logic for form submission using Google Appscript, and for Python wrote a script that saved me hours of manual work (basically extracting mails from long videos). Felt good to actually use code for my own need.Then in the last 2 weeks I wanted to be more focused, so I came across OSSU. Started it, been watching, reading, and solving problem sets. What I understood is OSSU community curated a CS curriculum which is kind of equivalent to a CS program, and they say it takes 13–30 months (42 courses).Now here’s the thing: I do spend around 12h a day on desk, not just tutorials/practice but also hardware related videos. Planning to get electronics starter kit too.But still I feel like, am I doing it right? Like after so many tutorials I still need help from LLMs while writing some Python logic (not for solving full problem sets but just small things). Is this normal?Leaving that aside, I wanted to know if I’m going in right direction or if there’s a more efficient/better path. My expectations are kinda crazy high, I want to get some technical job or work on some big project by the end of this.Would appreciate some perspective from people who’ve gone through self-learning / OSSU / drop year like me.",

        "content": "I have learnt most programming languages from Harry and when this course launched, I did not even give second thoughts because of the trust I had. Speaking of the course, the explanations are no doubt good because Harry explains well, however, it's clearly not worth 2900 and I'll tell the reasons I feel that way:You don't learn programming by just good explanations, you learn by solving more and more problems on a topic from basic to advanced. The problem in his courses is that in many sections, for example NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. There are just pure lectures and handbooks of the lectures. No questions to practice or use the things you learn in a lecture.Result? You have to search for questions yourself, filter for the basics to intermediate to advanced level questions and that would be scattered, which means , not curated to what you learnt after every lecture. And that is the second major part of why people prefer courses. It's for the ease of getting resources for practice curated to the teachings step by step.I've been a part of the Pierian Data Science Course on Udemy too, and the two MAJOR plus points of it were first, it had after every few lectures, practice questions, and that too on an integrated ipynb jupyter kernel on the website itself so you can do it then and there. And the second, the site allows you to take notes of yourself on any part of the video. And I got this course for 900/- only(on the udemy sale days which happen once a while quite often) which is more than 3 times cheaper than CWH Data Science course.And lastly, the course's availability is only for a timeframe, not lifetime access.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, new poster and new to Python programming. I've been learning Python through 23 Mooc and have been having this annoying pestering itch in the back of my head that I'm doing something wrong.As soon as I hit a wall with my code, I open up MSpaint and try to logic through the problem. Most of the questions on Mooc seem to be heavily math/logic based so that's the approach I try to go for. The problem is that, even though I end up getting the output correct, my code feels janky or \"brute-forcey\". For instance, one problem asked me to collect a user generated number, then print out each number from 1 -> that number but alternating between the next highest, back down to the next lowest (sorry if that's a bad explanation; kind of like this: {[input: 5] : 1, 5, 2, 4, 3})My code ended up looking like this:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------input_number = int(input(\"Please type in a number: \"))counter = 1alternating_number = input_number - 1index = 1 while (index * 2) <= input_number: print(index) index += alternating_number print(index) alternating_number -= 1 index -= alternating_number alternating_number -= 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But oh dang! When I input an odd number, it cuts off right before the last number gets printed. So I open up MSpaint again and find a pattern regarding the odd numbers. So I add this code to the end:odd_helper = 0while counter <= input_number: if counter % 2 != 0: odd_helper += 1 odd_numbers = odd_helper counter += 1if input_number % 2 != 0: print(input_number - (odd_numbers - 1))-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And the program works as expected, and succeeds the tests. After all that time spending solving it, it still feels wrong, kind of like I cheated an answer out. After looking at the model solution, their example is so clear, concise, and makes perfect sense. I guess my ultimate question for you guys is: is a janky solution that still works good enough, even if that solution feels like you're cheating?",

I'm kind of lost on how to implement this, maybe counting signals, I geniuenly don't know.I believe that it's wrong that the existing programs expect this behaviour from the previous implementation, but we can't just rewrite the entire userspace. The new implementation has to take this case into consideration.So how do I go about this?Thanks for guidence!",

People avoid you. Your PRs sit in review hell. You get excluded from decisions. You end up working 2x harder for half the impact.**The counterintuitive solution: Embrace strategic calm.**I started doing less. I stopped panic-working. I took actual lunch breaks.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Working with LLMs I noticed at least four important shortcomings that make them unsuitable to really replace software engineers.1. Non-deterministic, software engineers like other engineers usually chose this career path because they are able to thinker with things and expect a specific response, it doesn't take much tinkering to start to dislike the LLMs prompts.2. Highly inconsistent code, often code produced with LLM happens to lack [consistency](https://medium.com/@jonfinerty/consistency-in-software-42626ac4219f) from line to line.3. Lack of precision of the generated code. Code is highly imprecise compared with a mediocre coder, and even a beginner coder, at this section is the fact that most of the time there is superfluous code. Also generated code cannot be made more precise by a human, because usually best code come in the engineers mind through ideation and abstraction among others things LLM are incapable of doing. This precision thing is also one reason a specific kind of people are attracted to software engineering.4. Speed, coding speed is not improved by LLMs if you count for quality, debugging and code-coverage, actually if you account for fixing the other 3 shortcoming enumerated before it is much, much slower needing more developers to fix these shortcoming introduced by the LLMs.Another shortcoming I wanted to add is the total lack of congruence but that can be derived from the lack of consistency, also this term is not well defined and used in software engineering. Given at least these four shortcomings you would think that LLMs are not fit to replace software engineers, at least at this stage, you would think that they could try first replacing customer support or marketing or other sections from the corporate structure. Not that I think it can replace these people either, but I mean for the sake of the argument that shows software engineers are specifically selected from a bunch of people.I think is a selling point, software engineers are the most expensive people that don't belong to the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)crowd or their flunkies. And a lot of the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)is heavily invested in this AI thing on a metaphysical level.I think the AI bubble is about to pop and the Tech bros are selling replacing software engineers to the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)bunch as a last resort since it wasn't able to make any profit and also lately not making any visible progress, Thus [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)was sold on the idea hopes to obtain two things:\\- a lot of profit from replacing most of software engineers;\\- drag the price down for the remaining software engineers the way customer service robots did for entry customer service people.But both of these are not reachable.I think this move is the most dangerous move for our guild and our careers: \\- Layoffs are already happening;\\- Hiring market is in disarray;\\- And massive amounts of capital from software industry is already gone and going on a ruse;My two cents.",

So to the current engineers above entry level, their jobs are safe today, and the lack of entry level/grads coming in today would cause a scarcity of experienced engineers in the future. Therefore, the senior/mid-level engineers of today are in a very sweet spot, because they’ll be high in demand in the future? (More than they already are currently)This theory breaks down ofc if future AI also comes for senior jobs, but I don’t think that’s likely (at least in lifetime) So to the mid level/senior engineers - we will hopefully relive the glory days of the 2010s iA What do you think of my theory?",

        "content": "Before I joined my current role, I was making an average of 80k a year (in a very hcol area). I decided to apply to FAANG thinking that I probably won't get an interview anyways but I somehow got it and somehow passed it and now I'm making more money than I've ever dreamed of. I have 4 YoE at a startup where I wore many hats and learned an incredible amount of things but at the end of the day, it was still a very small startup serving a few hundred users. Everything I did could've been boiled down to simple CRUD work with some business logic sprinkled in, that you could learn from a Udemy course. So when I was joining, I was extremely scared and thought that I wouldn't be good enough because I felt like I was in the minor leagues and now I was coming up to the big leagues so of course the stakes are higher, pay is amazing, the work will be more intense, etc.However to be honest it feels like not much has changed. I know I'm only a few months in but I'm working on things ranging from minor tickets to full blown apps and it's still the same CRUD work I used to do. In fact here, so many things are abstracted away that I don't need to worry about a ton of things so it feels even easier. That comes with having to setup a ton of boilerplate to create a simple route, but seeing how other routes have it setup basically lets you know all you need to know.Obviously there's issues regarding scale as I never had to worry about it, but again it's as straightforward as saying I want this new data model to be shared by having a keyword and boom, everything is taken care of. It's honestly incredible. So all that to say, I've realized that I've never felt comfortable or \"safe\" yet, like I'm almost waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like is this it? Is it really this straightforward and I was worried for nothing? Or does it truly get more challenging and complex as you go and I just haven't been here long enough to see that.",

Training and running these models costs a fortune. All the big boys are fighting to become THE definitive AI provider adopted by the corporates. Its looking like it might be Microsoft with its Co-pilot integration. And one things that Microsoft is famous for is getting you fully integrated into their stack and then whacking the prices up. The AI providers will have no choice once the infinite investor money hose stops. Once that happens I wonder exactly how much AI will be saving them money when they are having to pay massive licencing fees, and per-token costs increasing into the dollars, rather than the pennies like right now.A similar situation is happening with a lot of companies Cloud bills increasing massively. In fact, a lot of companies are looking for way to bring things back on prem and regretting their decisions. Many companies wish they could move back on prem, but can't afford to due to getting rid of all their infrastructure guys and the cost of migrating back being too much.I am thinking that should AI replace entire dev teams, a lot of these companies will regret it when the rug-pull happens.",

Chatgpt being better than grok.I've attached the convo here. It's a possibility my prompt engineering skills were not good enough, but I think that if chatgpt/grok, are going to be blindly followed (and I know this is going to happen) there could be disastrous consequences. What I'm trying to say is that Grok is not at the point where it should be trusted for relatively simple calculus problems. In one place Grok mentioned that my reasoning was fallacious do to circular reasoning, but apparently circular reasoning not as it's commonly understood in any logic textbook, (and therefore, not actually fallacious for the same reason). So if I can't even trust Grok to use language to convey a correct meaning, now I'm hit with a conundrum if I should even waste my time using grok to help with learning (like the time I wasted writing this post)Is there like some sort of secret AI that companies are using that are that much better than chatgpt/grok that justifies them firing people and making our economy hell (besides h1b and outsourcing mainly to india of course)?

        "content": "I'm working at a super early startup as an intern, and am literally the first employee they hired. Everybody else are co-founders, etc. I'm working on a huge part of project dev, mainly software related, and I'm in for only a month. so the contract has 1.5 months left, yet I was told to leave at the end of this month. Like man I'm only 5 weeks in. This is not a rant post (well kinda cuz it's just an intern) though, I just wanna know if there's any reflection I can get out of this. My leader told me my progress was not as good as he expected to be, and that I'm lacking communication, etc, and more closely they decided to hire someone else with years of experience, not to replace me but to work on completely different part. In a nutshell, they feel like my part is not good enough so they kinda give up and work on other things to raise opportunity for the funding round, at least from my understanding. I won't go deep into my work, but basically I'm developing a huge part of the project from stratch to a workable demo, which involves sub system and sub sub system, etc etc. they're blaming me for not talking with my colleagues enough, but I'm essentially doing this R&D work all alone. From what I know, they made the decision to pause whatever I'm working on cuz they feel like it's far from good enough for the funding round demo, to \"save the money to hire somebody else to work another more promising end of the product\". I wonder if this is common for early startup, not the fact that they hired a summer intern as one of the earliest employees, but do huge change on product features for the demo. Other than this, I'll greatly appreciate any advice on my case, did I dodged a bullet, etc. Personally, I can definitely improve the communication part even though it's pretty much useless for my work, but all my colleagues got all these meetings I don't need to attend, so they're pretty much occupied with talking to investors, suppliers, etc etc all these \"big things to solved\".

These are the sorts of things that, if left undone, are a general pain in the ass for everyone but not business critical.Generally a lot of this work is done by new grads, interns or new hires (IN ADDITION to other things like a real project if your company doesn't suck), if you're lucky to have them on your team. Great teaching tool for them, and better time spent from more senior engineers for things AI still sucks at.In the last 4 months I have absolutely churned out these fixes/features like nobody's business using AI because it took a fraction of the time to do. Incredible leverage.I used to always push for regularly hiring some fresh blood on our team so that we could take care of these things. Now I don't. Simply don't need them, on my team, if I take a myopic view. There's no apparent incentive on the team level to ask for junior headcount.--*(I'm just offering an example. I know where not hiring junior folks eventually leads. A very bad place.

        "content": "Sorry if this sounds a bit of a rant, but I just passed the 4 YOE mark and am now starting to get extremely anxious over (how I feel anyway) not having learned much of anything/developed any skills as a SWE. I just need some hard truths/perspective/advice.I work for a company that is essentially a defense contractor (though not in the traditional sense). Started off at 90k with mid year and end of year raises. Am now at 132k. However, now that I look back, I feel like I haven’t learned much of anything. Listed below are the projects that I’ve worked through at my job:1. Started off by supporting a study/analysis where I was basically taking existing MatLab scripts, writing my own scripts, and cobbling them together (all in MatLab - no other tools/software) to generate, process, and manipulate data for analysis. Learned about a lot of stuff like Kalman filters, linear algebra, and math related etc, but Not software engineering - just a lot of MatLab scripting2. We received a black box software that needed to be installed and ran on my workplaces systems (including on a HPC). I had to get it running (as in, hit the executable and not have it crash). All I really did was make sure the .so files were properly linked, set up a few text config files, and figure out the right terminal command to input to get it running on the HPC. Pretty much no programming whatsoever.3. This was setting up a GitLab CI/CD for an existing project. Essentially, setting up the virtual machine for the runner, configuring the GitLab file to build and run, as well as creating a python script that analyzed unit/regression test outputs for correctness (automatically called by the runner). No real programming.4. What I consider to be my first actual large SWE project. However, the tech stack was pretty much non-existent. It was essentially a message based, event driven simulation in C++. The “database” was just a folder of CSV’s that were read in. I did create framework to connect to a MySQL server and/or SQLite server as alternatives to access the same data (learned more about abstract classes, etc). The build process was just a bunch of Make scripts (deadass just pure, rawdog Make scripts). I did implement new features, but frankly speaking, the code base was awful. The simulation framework itself was decent and I occasionally touched it, but the actual processing of events/messages was incredibly convoluted (culmination of literal generations of technical debt). I honestly felt like I was back in College, creating random ass functions and just writing huge chunks of code because to try and refactor it all was just not feasible. I did get some experience also writing BOOST unit/regression tests. 5. This was another simulation project. However, I was far less involved with the actual framework/architecture of the simulation. I mainly worked on algorithms for what was actually being simulated. IE, I did not have to think too much about classes, design philosophy. There was literally just an empty place holder function for some functionality, and I just had to come up with an algorithm to produce that functionality (think guidance and control for vehicles).6. This is what I consider to be the most “SWE” project so far (and is my current one). It’s essentially a Java desktop App (built as a Maven project) with JavaFx front end and pure Java back end. I’m still new to this project, but seeing how it’s been programmed, it looks beautiful with really clean/elegant code, though I couldn’t even explain WHY that code is clean/elegant (just the vibes). Learned more about socket connections and JavaFX. However, even in this project, we don’t really use all those full stack technologies you hear about like Kubernetes, React, Docker (I’ve also had to create Docker images before but not as part of like a larger tech stack).Essentially, I feel like nearly all of my experience has just been about hammering out code. I haven’t really touched any of that “tech stack” stuff I hear a lot about. Furthermore, just looking at how some of that code (#6) is written makes me realize that even when it comes to just hammering out code, I’m doing it in a very “College Undergraduate With a Vague Semblance of Best Practices” way instead of the clean/elegant (albeit complicated because I don’t understand all of the language’s features) way I witnessed. And don’t even get me started on system design. I know legit nothing about system design (aside from general terms like protocol, load balancing, etc).Is this normal for someone with a whole 4YOE to know this little? If not, how can I improve? I know the best way is to “create projects on your own time”, but are there any resources that that can give me starting pointers? Like a “suppose you want to create a full stack application that does whatever, here is every tech you need and how they relate” so I can at least fill out the details by myself in a project? Or what about resources that I can learn regarding elegant code (for example, I’ve been reading Effective Java 3rd Edition).",

To the point where it came up in my performance review like \"you just aren't getting it\"In my defense, this codebase was okay in the beginning working on certain layers and microservices, by the end it was just like WTF - I asked a senior to walk me through and I swear despite spending months understanding this codebase - it was like watching somebody pull a rabbit out of a hat with some of these solutions they were coming up with. Like the answer for the bug was somewhere in the codebase I wasn't even looking cause how did that area even have relevance to this particular service? They didn't even feel logically connected but somehow I guess they were? The stack trace is what I typically followed but it often led me down roads I already tried.I asked my internship peers for help but I got the cold shoulder \"idk\" and they were getting their tickets done - so somehow they did know but I think it was competitive or something so everyman for themselves kinda stuff?But I was just completing my tickets too slow - my manager was like \"these are like 5H tickets at most and they are taking you days\"I feel like I'm not cut out for this if I can't do the \"easiest\" thing. Is this my cue to dip out/ I ain't cut out for this?I do like the work, even when I was frustrated and going in circles I enjoyed it on the inside tbh, but I don't like not getting results and people watching me not get results lol and the industry is all about results like sheesh.Edit: Thanks for the thoughtful replies guys , im taking lots of notes rn , I can't get back to everyone anymore but I'll be reading everything.",

The one time I was about to get a dev job, on a very small team, I ended up passing the coding exam (was literally reverse a string) but the manager didn't give me the role because I didnt have prior experience.My last IT role had me writing a lot of python scripts, BASH, powershell, as well as working with AWS and Azure. All of these things are good, but they are not software engineering. I feel like I have the skills to be a good software engineer. People cheated off of me back in university. But with the way the market is now, as well as the amount of years with me being out of a job, is it even possible?Lately I do not even get interviews for dev roles, which I did when I was only 2 years out. Just \"you experience doesnt meet our requirements\" or \"we went with someone else\" and that's that. Am I cooked? Would getting a masters help me at all? I highly doubt it but oh well",

I'm more curious as to what could be behind the sudden change. It doesn't seem like my manager is actually the one behind it, but rather it's coming from upper management. Just for some more context I've been at the job for almost 2 years, always had great feedback from my previous manager, never really heard any complaints about my work. Then we got a new manager a few months ago, everything started ok, our one on one meetings are typically just him asking if I needed anything. Then a few weeks back he suddenly drops a bombshell, that I'm not performing to the level of expectations for a \"senior\" developer. And most of the reasons he gave are rather vague, ie not being \"independent\" enough, asking too many questions, etc. ie nothing to do with my work or getting stuff done. Then it just escalated, he started complaining about my pull requests with more vague things like \"why did you do it X way when Y way would have been better?\" Note that during all this time I just took it all in and never argued or tried to defend myself, because most of the things he mentioned are vague ie how do I respond to being told that I ask too many questions? I know all the signs are pointing to upper management wanting to replace me with someone who is probably cheaper(not that I'm making a lot to begin with), but who knows? They haven't officially put me on a PIP or anything, just non stop criticisms. It's just a bit weird that companies these days have to go thru so much trouble to come up with vague reasons to get rid of employees. Or am I maybe reading things the wrong way?",

I’ve managed to keep the “doom and gloom” at bay for years, but today it finally got to me. I had a full-blown meltdown and broke down sobbing to my wife.My fear is that all of this hard work will be for nothing—that I’ll graduate, struggle to find a job, and end up back in my current field (trucking) or working a random service job just to make ends meet.I’ve overcome a lot in my life: homelessness as a teenager, extensive childhood trauma, and growing up in a very rough environment. I have a beautiful wife whom I love dearly and a daughter in high school (I became a parent as a teenager). I’m doing this for them—and for me. But right now, it feels like the many lost hours, the stress of working full-time, and the emotional labor of supporting my family might end up being a waste.I love coding. I love the problem-solving—it’s like virtual Legos to me. More than anything, I want to build a stable career doing something I love, while providing for my family. But with all the negative voices out there, I’m starting to doubt if there’s any hope in this industry.Should I stay the course? Could my CS degree be leveraged into something adjacent like cybersecurity if the market is too tight? Or am I setting myself up for disappointment?Sorry for the wall of text—just in a very dark place right now.",

I wasn't included in meetings that decided my work and I was handed tasks from the lead dev, usually in the form of a paragraph with a visual and that was about it. I'd be told \"lets see what you come up with\" and from there I'd have to do my own research and planning. The lead dev already had a full idea of what the project should be, its requirements, and specifications and I would be penalized if what I came up with didn't line up with what he had. I essentially worked in a bubble and only had interactions once in a while, essentially starting projects from scratch. When I asked questions, I'd basically be given a 20 question knowledge check and denied answers if I didn't think the same way a dev with 10 years of experience did. I basically hit a point where my default assumption is that I'm always wrong. I was basically laid off for not operating like a dev with 10 years of experience because the assumption management and the lead dev had was that 3 years should mean I'm, on par with the lead dev. I also had no mentorship while on the job after the first 2-3 weeks.I guess I went in with the preconceived notion from college that there would be more collaboration and discussion on tasks and have a clear image of how a project should work what it should do and why before even starting to code. The expectation my manager laid out in my last few months was \"You've been here for 3 years, you shouldn't need to work with anyone on projects, you should be able to take projects yourself and do them by yourself.\" I was then put on a big project that involved reworking a ton of code to be sent externally and me asking for stand up meetings to make sure I'm in expectations was considered a negative point against me. Is this just a standard developer experience, full on trial by fire every day and if you aren't solving every issue, it means you've failed as a developer? I'm assuming I'm just a bad developer who's not capable of handling this line of work because I need direction.",

We celebrate the self-made, self-taught, entrepreneurial superstar in this industry. And the passion for the work- why aren't there more stars on your GitHub repos, man? But is it through grit or is it inborn genius? \"Leetcode is just a proxy for IQ tests.\" So what happens when you're not that? When you just don't have enough passion or enough smarts or- what? Experience? A coding history since your age was single-digit? There's something totalitarian about this profession- not in the sense that it's authoritarian, but that it demands absolute commitment, that your identity is to be subsumed into the totality of the hustle. It would also sting less if companies weren't so *bubbly* about selling themselves. \"Oh we welcome you. Oh we're a family. Come and play foosball at our annual retreat.\" Kick you to the curb like so much dertritus. Would be more honest if they behaved like fintech firms or banks or something, cold and mechanical corporate machines. Instead it's all warm smiles hiding extra rows of teeth.

        "content": "I've spent a large part of my \"career,\" doing passable work on existing projects. I was hired at my current position without a relevant degree and the world's tiniest amount of existing work. I've been in a position for five years. The entire time, I vacillated between feeling like I could do anything, and feeling like I was lucky to accomplish what I'd set out to accomplish. I've always cognitively known that I wasn't as good as a trained professional, but I think I started to lose sight of what that actually meant as time went on. Add to that the fact that there's simply so much I don't know that I don't know. Ultimately, I think I've probably been blissfully ignorant. I used to think that if I spent enough time iterating, I could figure most things out. I've frequented tutorials, articles and the messing around and finding out I used to do back when I felt I had more time. I've also been leaning hard on AI to learn new tricks.I've got a few certifications, but I strongly suspect that's because I'm good at testing and preparing to test -- not because I know the content the certifications really ask for. It's always felt like there was a lot of knowledge that \"real,\" professionals just knew; that the certs assumed. I think a few superiors of mine have been sort of covering for me? I'm not sure. But I know I've given them a front row seat to my ignorance and I've seen how they've worked around it. I don't have those supports anymore. It's led to problems -- poor, inflexible designs when I could do things, and code built on what I could accomplish, not the best tools for the job, when I couldn't. Right now, I'm in a position where I have several complex problems on my plate including buggy systems that I've written and all I know is that if I'm lucky enough to solve any of them -- they'll probably be hacked together. I'm aware at the highest possible level of techniques and practices that would help, but I've never implemented them before, and I won't be able to just \"figure things out.\" anymore. My job thinks I'm somewhere between mid and senior level, and I just... Am not. My ego has been all over the place and I think I've been projecting like I was better than I was without being 100% aware of it. I'm at the point where I'd quit, if I could. I don't want to be a hinderance; I'm worried that my coworkers are depending on me, and I'm so burned out from doing everything I can to get by (short of like.... Actually having spent my years of work formally learning) that I can't even be useful in the ways that would ordinarily be expected of me. TLDR; I'm pretty sure I've been the worst example of a bad, \"hotshot\" dev.Where can I go from here? I've been thinking that I've got to let someone know that I'm out of my depth. I don't want to give my employer a packaged reason to fire me, but I also really don't want to keep on as I am. The stuff I support deserves better.",

There's no time to take a step back and reduce velocity. There's pressure to always perform and hit 'deadlines' which gives me perofmance anxiety because I witness people who got PIPed because of 'performance'. When the company operated like this I went from having a job that I love to something that I hate as I was met with stress and stress. I just feel exhausted now.Then...there's the stress of the job market, we wont know how long we are unemployed for.**What helped me:**\\- Im frugal by nature so I saved alot in my retirement acountt\\- 1 year emergency fund\\- Social life and physical acitivty (helps me destress ALOT).

I am about to start my CS Masters program at good public school (UMD) and am thinking about quitting my job where I feel stuck and see no future.I currently work at small somewhat dying government contractor company. I've been here for 3 years and I feel like the company been slowly dying: went from 1000 employees when I started to about 80 now, CEO/owner is not taking any pay this year, benefits are being cut, no new contracts, and list can go on. I've started as intern working with CEO 3 years ago and later moved into more of team lead position/developer position. Working with CEO introduced me to lots of cool tech and experiences, I went from student with 0 level of experience to someone who can lead teams and develop products. While I loved the experience - my income hasn't changed since I started 3 years ago and as for now I make only $40k/year. I've been doing great at school. Graduated this spring and was offered admission to CS Masters program at UMD which came with some financial offer (free tuition plus $1500k/month stipend) for at least 1 semester. I also got an offer to work for a lab (actually a few of them). Those labs look very promising and if that work out I might be able to get a research position that would cover my tuition for the whole time. Here is the conflict I have. While I don't feel like my job can help me to grow - I do like being employed, being paid, having health insurance and gaining the experience. On the other hand - I see lots of opportunities within academia and putting time and effort into working and networking might help me to secure much better position later. TL;DR: Is it a bad idea quiting tech job with no future for Masters hoping to get better career afterwards?",

I feel like it would be impossible for me to hold a job with 5 times the workload as before, but I've also heard from multiple tech people that tech doesn't require you to actually focus for the 40 hours. I've applied to SSDI, but given my education and experience, it's unlikely. (I have two friends, also with autism, on disability, but they were never college educated).So how many hours do you focus on coding? And I'm wondering if there's any advice on finding a \"laid back\" job, or any tips for holding a normal job, especially if you also have autism and/or adhd.

I’m feeling very indecisive though because I’ve had a strong year on my current team and was told many months ago that I had been nominated to be promoted at the end of this year.Part of me wants to wait and secure that because it would be another 1-2 years before that opportunity arises again. However, my girlfriend really wants me to move with her. I did try to suggest we wait but she’s very eager to go now, and have since signed for a place.I have a place in our current city so that’s not the issue, it’s mainly leaving a promotion for my relationship or staying and risk missing out on 5+ months in the new city with her.I know this is a bit between career/relationship advice but as someone relatively new to their career I’m very curious what others in the field think.EDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing your insights, I really do feel a lot more at peace now. Given that I don’t want to stay with this company much longer anyways, and the realization that having the promotion won’t necessarily give me that much more leverage for a new position, I’m going to take the new opportunity and move. Like some of you said, relationships are more important than a job and I need to prioritize what matters most to me.",

I told him explicitly I can't work from 5PM - 7PM, but could work after that. Despite this, every single time the manager would have a meeting with me, he would ask these questions that seemed to imply I wasn't working. He would say things like \"where are you working from\", \"when did you start working today\", \"how many hours have you been working\", stuff like thatHe tried scheduling a meeting at 6pm my time. I told him, I could not make it to this time and he would have to schedule it at either 4pm or 7:30pm. He took a heavy amount of offense to this and started saying some cryptic stuff about how it's not acceptable that I \"disappear\" at that time. I didn't want to explain to him the reason (why's it his business?), but I had to have this time off to do physical therapy due to a busted hip, which will prep me for a surgery. I simply can't put this off, because it was causing a lot of painFinally, I think the \"breaking point\" was one day when I woke up at 6am and looked at my phone to see a bunch of notifications from around 2AM, one after the other, asking me if I was online. I messaged back (at now 6AM) and said I just woke up, was it something urgent? He said it wasn't, but I should have been awake. I was not on call. Anyway, I ended up getting fired and when I asked HR why, they said I \"disappeared\". I asked for any tangible proof and pointed at the github contributions, which were every hour 7am-5pm every weekday. They did not respondSimilarly, I just got a new manager at my company who seems to be doing the same thing. She's constantly saying I'm not doing enough, not doing the right thing, \"not working\", but when I ask for tangible examples, she will not provide them. To counter, I show an exact audit of everything I did over the past few weeks, which was at least 2-5 tickets per day with correspondence over slack. She still says she's upset by itThis doesn't seem to help, at all. Like every time I bring up \"actual proof\", it feels like that just makes the problem so much worse.

        "content": "A while back, I made a post about how developing soft skills (alongside coding) helped me build visibility, trust, and alignment at work and eventually get promoted to senior much faster than others. You can check it out in my posts history if you are interested.One of the most common questions I got on that post was around how I developed my spoken communication skills because I think that is what a majority of engineers struggle with, so decided to make a separate post about it.For context, I have grown up very introverted and shy. Always have had trouble with clear spoken communication - I used to stutter, use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc, which really affected my confidence and made me want to stay quiet most of the times, even during meetings. I always used to think that this skill was reserved for extroverted people and naturals. Boy, was I wrongThis year I decided to do something about it. Since I was an introvert and used to be holed up in my apartment most of the time away from people, I used to spend an ungodly amount of time on Youtube lol. I noticed that some YouTubers that I had been following for a couple years, were just so charismatic, articulate, authentic and genuine but when I went back and saw some of their old videos, they were completely different - awkward, and ineloquent. Kind of made me realize that the fact that they had been making videos for so long, they have been training their speaking muscle over and over again, and over time got immensely good at it.This gave me the idea to try doing something similar. So I slowly started recording myself speaking to the phone camera. I wasn’t the most consistent with it but slowly overtime I slowly started seeing progress. I used to just talk / ramble about anything (my day, experiences etc) just to get comfortable and tried to keep speaking for at least 5 mins.I even started YouTube channels to keep myself accountable to keep practicing and slowly start following a structured pattern  - since at work, during meetings or presentations etc I wasn’t going to just talk about my day etc. I started off with having word for word scripted videos but that was making me come off as really inauthentic. But with consistent practice, overtime I became comfrotable enough to just riff off from the top of my head while having just 2-3 main points in front of me.This truly boosted my confidence more than I can put into words!This translated directly Into work as well because now I was able to talk a lot more fluently and eloquently, and with confidence + authority. I had fixed my issues - stuttering, losing track of thought, using filler words etc - almost by 80%+.***TL;DR*** Record yourself speaking daily (even just 5 minutes). It feels awkward at first, but it will transform how you communicate within a couple of months. Speaking really is a muscle.Thanks for reading this long post haha. Hope this helps anyone who’s struggled with speaking up!Happy to answer any questions in the comments or DMs :)",

I knew I enjoyed coding quite a bit but figured I wouldn’t be looked at initially for a software engineering role so I transitioned to a IT Help Desk role in the medical field (even coached people on PIPs towards the end), a Senior Technician role, and finally landed a Software Developer job this March. Unfortunately, every role has ended due to some kind of company wide change like suddenly outsourcing our IT department, sudden contract loss, and most recently, a company shutdown.I’ve been targeting project management, Python/HTML engineering, data analysis, IT sales (not preferred), and implementation. Are there other adjacent roles I should be looking at where I can continue to improve? I genuinely want to do the grunt work when it comes to coding",

There’s always a lot of info on interview prep but some seem unrealistic. I never took a DSA course or learned Neural Networks in university. I just landed a software engineer (Machine Learning) position a year after I graduated. Here’s how I prepped in around 6 months to be FAANG and big tech ready.Book: A common sense guide to data structures and algorithms (ruby and javascript) i use python and this book is fine Course: Leetcode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash CourseYoutube: Andrej Karpathy Zero-To-HeroNeetcode 150: did around 100 problems twice. That was enough for me but I studied Math so my problem solving skills were already kind of highFor the MLE position it was a mixture of leetcode, OOP, and neural network architecture. Had to build a Multilayer Perceptron model from scratch in PyTorch (didn’t prep for this at all but i pulled through). Had a medium leetcode type of problem for first round.Tips: Be consistent but you don’t have to do 1000 problems to break into FAANG. MOCK INTERVIEW. leetcode isn’t enough to be good in a technical interview. I did a mock technical interview 1-2 times a week for 3 months straight. You need a good resume to break into FAANG there isn’t a way to just break into FAANG. Your linkedin and resume needs to be peak.",

Last year, i spent the first 8 months not working looking for SWE jobs, that didn’t get me anywhere. No responses. No interviews. Just idle. The last couple months I decided maybe it’s time for me to make a switch into Solutions Engineering. Does anyone have any advice on this? I just feel that competing with people who are extremely talented when it comes to coding won’t put me in a good spot. I’m rusty with coding (out of practice), but I’ve also never been phenomenal at it. An average joe engineer. I’m just exhausted. Everyday I study something new for a company hoping I get somewhere. I don’t imagine myself doing leetcode questions everyday and studying like I’m back in college again. It seems so unfair. I went to college. I did the work. I have the degree. I want to work and make money. I’m dedicated and ambitious, but that is not enough for this career. I need some guidance. I’m at a halt and feel so hopeless. I feel that my career is going down the drain. I’m in more debt now than I was when I was a teen and working at a coffee shop. Endless amount of studying for a few interviews that have gotten me nowhere. There’s just so much information in the technology world, it’s overwhelming. I’m at a loss. If anyone has some suggestions when it comes to Solutions Engineering, which I feel fits my personality more, or another job with my degree that’s more niche, I would appreciate the guidance.",

I'm going to lay out my career path, how I got here, and essentially ask for help on what I need to do to get out of this dead end in the next six to 12 months.Very long story short, one unexpected kid at 20 and I didn't get my college degree until 2019 at the age of 33. It was incredibly brutal to get there but I had a compsci degree from the University of Minnesota.Despite that, all of my efforts at job fairs were a bust. My best guess was my age was a factor, but I can't know. Regardless, the only job I could get my hands on at graduation was for a local embedded linux hardware company of \\~400 employees for \\~$70k. It was a bit of a tough pill to swallow given all of the guys I studied with (and often performed better than) landed at either Amazon or Target for significantly more money.I got some moderate Yocto experience and enough C++ to know I'd rather write in straight C than untangle legacy bowls of spaghetti. Covid hit almost immediately after I was hired and my subpar wage dipped into straight up rough territory within a year. When they called me back into the office I said no and flailed to look for a new job.That too was utterly brutal. I only really had \\~1.5yrs of Yocto/embedded experience and was still very green. The only job I could find was a remote gig in another embedded device company in Fargo. The pay was $100k. It wasn't great, but it was a raise, and they promised me I would continue my embedded Yocto experience. This struck me as a deal as I could continue to transport my kids to school and work on the same skillset. Id eventually be a marketable embedded developer in +/- 3 years I felt.It was also a lie. I never, ever touched anything embedded, leaving all of my experience at my first job to largely rot before I could get it to the magic \"5 years\" point. Instead it was secretly full Reactjs/Swift/XCode/C# userspace server code. I now have \\~3.5 years of that when my company was bought and I was thrown out of that team into a.... yocto embedded team. I now have 6 more months of experience there. Most of that time was spent remembering things I had completely forgotten.I have been looking for a job to get off this roller coaster since early 2023. I barely even get callbacks. I've gotten two interviews. One was a dud, the other was a trap that offered me $80k without asking me a single tech question. I know this Reddit is aware of the pitfalls and stressors of looking for a job in this field right now so there is no reason to go further.My work history is essentially in shambles and looks horrible on paper from all this thrashing. Both companies do not have names that make my resume stand out in any meaningful way. I realize (or presume) that the only way out for me is to work all day, then code all night and create a portfolio in a space that mildly interests me.I have been working in Rust, which I thoroughly enjoy, and have been messing around in Ratatui crate, which I also enjoy, but work is slow between two high school kids I teach how to drive simultaneously, being the one breadwinner, the one adult that drives, and the one person who does household shopping and cooking. I am too stretched thin to not be attacking this with maximum efficiency.I need to stop wandering in the dark and find the straightest line possible to get me out of my stagnant job/wage. I came to this whole industry late and dont have either the best discipline or sense on how one furthers their career as quickly as possible and becomes marketable in the most effective way, and I'm up to my eyeballs in all the extraneous \"life\" stuff that is non-negotiable. I basically need a road map.Thank you for spending any amount of time on that. I am 100% serious and have the work ethic, I just don't have the direction. I appreciate any constructive first steps.",

I failed a technical at a mid-size because I had gotten a bit nervous, but I have two interviews coming up for small startups. One is an internship, which is still okay in my book as they stated there is a possibility for conversion. However, the other is a full-time role, but seems to be giving off a bad feeling.The full-time startup is a company that has been around for 5 years but has not seemed to produce anything of value. They have an app with no users and that is actually outdated on the current Android version. All their engineers seem to be scooped straight out of college with no prior experience (no internships, no work history, unprofessional LinkedIn profiles), and it doesn't look like there's a Senior developer on the team? The CEO's daughter seems to be the 'recruiter', and the GlassDoor reviews? The developers seem like they despised the CEO with all the reviews implying he is a nightmare to work with and goes on firing sprees when he's not happy with the work. Low pay, no benefits, no evidence of producing any actual software. I applied thinking they were simply small and starting out, but I didn't know they had even been around for 5 years because all their employees have 1 year or less of experience, and I just assumed that's probably when they started.Is it even worth going to the interview at that point? I know the mantra is that 'any foot in the door is good' but I think I'd rather spend the next several months searching for other roles than being part of this company. But I'm also being told by peers that they would kill for any opportunity and I'm not being serious about my job search if I will turn down interviews.",

I was given the chat of \"We don't have enough work anymore in what you do, so you have to expand to stay relevant.\" Fair, ok.Trouble is, I was immediately thrown into accelerated deadlines with no training. PMs recently were given more power due to trying to fix financial issues in the company. Basically, we charge clients a few lump sums of work and don't technically have billable hours. We track billable hours internally just to make sure things are still profitable. I got throw onto not one but two projects in which either the client misinterpreted the work and a non-technical person put together the contract which led to a loss. Or, the PMs made promises that couldn't be kept and tried to be technical and then tried to cover by forcing terrible deadlines (asking for 6 weeks of work in 4 days sort of nonsense).I've been getting whiplash and it's effected me negatively. Upper management doesn't like how to push back on timelines while at the same time stating that engineers tell the PMs what a reasonable timeline is and then reneg and support impossible goals. I keep asking for time to work on some training so I can do the new work, ask questions and actually make it my skillset (no, I can't do it in me free time, this is not a skillset that can be googled, it's purely mentored skills only, thing post-quantum crypto analysis activities in alignment with niche security standards in specific nations).I have been compensating for this lack of time being given on projects or training by working weekends...the last four. I've been 1-2 days behind on all my tasks even with long days and working weekends. I'm doing my best when management won't listen to me.Friday I saw the lab director looking at my work, he voiced he was upset I said work was done by 5PM when he found gaps. Our lead wasn't going to look at it until Monday, and I am spending the weekend making up the GAPs.They taught me that asking for the extra time was pushed back on. That the works \"should get done during the week\" while also \"recognizing the time constraints are a challenge.\" I cannot win. I figure it's better to ask for forgiveness then permission. I am giving of myself.But my direct manager basically gave me a heads up that upper management is pissed and reactive right now. I have four deadlines next week on three other projects and I got scheduled for 5 hours of meetings with ominous titles. I am working on an exit strategy but am in the \"hurry up and wait\" for a clearance related job. There are four labs in the world that do what we do: none are hiring right now. This is a VERY niche area of tech.Trying to keep calm, work up a game plan. I'm biding my time until I leave. I hate that I have to have the conversation again of, \"I am compensating the best I can for poor timelines, but you're still getting quality of work. You won't OK more work days, get offended when I honestly log my hours for weekends, I'm salaried, you don't pay me more for it. You tell me engineers determine timelines, but allow the PMs to reject and reset them. Everyone is so overworked that no mentoring is available and we're getting more and more work outside of our individual scopes because you fired 70% of the lab in January. Please give me a clear and consistent response on what you need me to do, and I'll do it.\"Objectively I am just in the time period of despair for some companies where management is failing hard and good workers can't compensate for their own ignorance and inconsistencies anymore. But I'm struggling. I have some real life things going on too, two deaths in the family in the last month, suing my insurance, husband had surgery, trying to squeak out some joy for myself...but I'm just drowning. I've been using my PTO liberally but it's going towards errands, those life things, and I even used a few to \"catch up on work without anyone talking to me.\" I know, terrible use.I would love some insight or emotional support. I feel like I am screaming into the void, squeezing blood from a stone, and at the end I might get axed no matter how hard I try.",

My leaning philosophy has always been to take the harder path, I want to become one with the terminal, started messing around with configs and p10k theme, but I always leave it on pure or bare bones settings, because I’m worried that if the console were somehow easier to use I would have a worse understanding of it and struggle with simpler terminals or actions on the job one day. I thought arch Linux was cool because of customization and needing to get really familiar with the terminal and maybe get a better understanding of os’s and such, initially it was for productivity, then aesthetics, then learning, but then the time commitment become so large I’m wondering if I’m misplacing it by not just building projects, learning more languages, or leet code. Do you think the true lower level understanding is necessary or am I wasting time and everything in that regard can be googled and I just need to learn to code?

After essentially procrastinating most of my 3 month summer after freshman year, I feel like I desperately need some advice for how I'm going to enter this field. As of right now, I essentially don't have any projects, connections, or other relevant experience. The most I've done was focusing on my intro classes to get into my major. There's so much advice for how I go about my journey that it feels overwhelming to know what's right, especially since most said advice is fragmented or terribly vague. It also doesn't help that I've mostly been alone in my journey so far and hence haven't received much guidance or collaboration. One common dilemma I face is how I learn programming. Most guides I've seen online feel contradictory or, again, vague. Like they would say don't follow tutorials and immediately after promote some 6 hour course I'm never going to finish, or start honestly. Others say learn these languages and do projects right after. Great, but how do I learn those languages? You see where I'm getting here? Every time I try pushing forward in my journey, the more vague, confusing, and overwhelming everything seems to feel, especially with the rise of the intense market and ai. With all that being said, I chose this field for a reason. I've been genuinely interested in cs ever since I was in high school, and from then until now couldn't find any other profession that would be as well suited for me. So it's been quite frustrating getting hurdles like this and not really making any progress for the past couple of years, despite all the free time I had. Does anyone have advice for me?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, this isn't \"career\" related question but something I've been experiencing recently. I'll give more concrete example for this case.I'm an L1 engineer with just under 2 YOE and my team recently started develping OpenAPI for our product. It's essentially an AWS API Gateway layer that will just redirect any incoming request to our internal endpoints with some middlewares such as authentiacation lambda and proxy for request and response transformation through VTL. Nothing too technically complicated.I realised that our team had to constantly deploy any changes made to endpoints to test them and this was delaying the development process significantly as we all had to wait 20 to 30 minutes for the whole application to test a minor change. So I started looking into testing this locally, and came across different ways such as using LocalStack or SAM Cli local and eventually settled on sam cli. I'm still not familiar with AWS and how these infrastructures work fully so I heavily relied on AI to explain to me how I can incorporate this into our existing system and get it eventually working. It ended up analysing the whole cdk and right up the entire mock auth and proxy system and start up a sam cli local server through docker. It didn't take me too long to understand what it has implemented and purpose behind it, although I knew that if I were to implement this on my own without AI, it would've taken a significant amount of time that it probably wouldn't have been worth keep digging and focus more on actual release of endpoints.It was definitely good learning experience and I feel like I learnt something quite useful and interesting but it also feels discouraging in some way that I would've not been able to deliver this in such short amount of time without AI as I basically did no coding in this context.I was wondering if I should take a different course of action in learning and developing something I have virtually no experience and knowledge in to actually learn it properly.",
