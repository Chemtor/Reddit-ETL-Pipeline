I work mainly with AWS, and I’m having some trouble understanding exactly how Databricks improves a pipeline and in what ways it simplifies development.Right now, we’re using Athena + dbt, with MWAA for orchestration. We’ve fully adopted Athena, and one of its best features for us is the federated query capability. We currently use that to access all our on-prem data, we’ve successfully connected to SAP Business One, SQL Server and some APIs, and even went as far as building a custom connector using the SDK to query SAP S/4HANA OData as if it were a simple database table.We’re implementing the bronze, silver, and gold (with iceberg) layers using dbt, and for cataloging we use AWS Glue databases for metadata, combined with Lake Formation for governance.And so for our dev experience is just making sql code all day long, the source does not matter(really) ... If you want to move data from the OnPrem side to Aws you just do \"create table as... Federated (select * from table) and that's it... You moved data from onprem to aws with a simple Sql, it applies to every source So my question is: could you provide clear examples of where Databricks actually makes sense as a framework, and in what scenarios it would bring tangible advantages over our current stack?",

In reality, it’s actually a complete team However, the expectation is that one DE is responsible for all of the areas; understanding the data model, owning telemetry/product analytics, ensuring data quality, maintaining data pipelines, building the dw and finally either building charts or partnering with analytics/reporting on the BI. The point being that if one of these teams drops the ball, the blame still falls on the DE. I’ve had this expectation everywhere I’ve been. Some places are better than others in terms of how big the Data team can be and perhaps placing more responsibility on the downstream and upstream teams, but it’s generally never a “you are only responsible for this area”I’m rambling a bit but hopefully you get the idea. Is it only my experience? Is it only a startup thing? I’m curious to hear from others.",

What is strategy for such joins in database. We have been using just a dedicated program written in c++ that just holds all that data in memory. Downside is that it involves custom coding, no sql, just is implemented using vectors and hash tables. Other downside is if this server goes down it takes some time to reload all the data. Also machine needs lots of ram. Upside is the query is very fast.I understand a type of aggregate materialized view could be used. But this doesn’t seem to work if clauses added to where. Would work for a whole join though.What are best techniques for such joins or what end typically used ?",

        "content": "Hey all,This might be a very dumb or ignorant question from me who know very little about DevOps or best practices in DE but would be great if I can stand on the shoulders of giants!For the background context, I'm working as a quant engineer at a company with about 400 employees total (60\\~80 IT staff, separate from our quant/data team which consists of 4 people, incl myself). Our team's trying to build out our analytics infrastructure and our IT department has set up **completely separate environments** for DEV, UAT, and PROD including:* Separate Snowflake accounts for each environment* Separate managed Airflow deployments for each environment* GitHub monorepo with protected branches (dev/uat/prod) for code (In fact, this is what I asked for. IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)This setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in SnowflakeI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?Again, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful. Thanks in advance for any insights and enjoy your rest of Sunday!",

That messy part is thankfully over, and I'm free to do data stuff.The problem is, I'm not experienced enough to lead a data team or even know the best place to start. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out how to shape my role, what to prioritize, and how to set myself up for growth.I’m comfortable with Python and SQL and have some exposure to Power BI, but not advanced. Our stack includes AWS, Metabase via PostgreSQL (for reporting to clients/partners or to expose our data to non technical colleagues e.g. customer support). No Snowflake or Spark that I'm aware of. Any data engineering tasks are currently handled by the software engineers.Note: A software engineer who left some time ago used dbt for a bit and I'm very interested in picking this up, if relevant. I was given a mix of BAU reporting tasks (client growth, churn rate, performance metrics, etc.) but the CTO gave me a 3-month task to investigate our current data practices, suggest improvements, and recommend new tools based on business needs (like Power BI).My ideal plan is to slowly transition into a proper Data Engineering role. I want to take over those tasks from the developers, build a more robust and automated reporting pipeline, and get hands-on with ETL practices and more advanced coding/SQL. I want to add skills to my CV that I'll be proud of and are also in demand.I'd really appreciate any advice on two main areas:1. a. What are the most effective things I can do right now to improve my daily work and start shaping the data?b. How do I use the currently available tools (PostgreSQL, Metabase, Python) to make my life easier when generating reports and client insights? Should I try to resurrect and learn dbt to manage my SQL transformations?c. Given the CTO's task, what kind of \"wrong practices\" should I be looking for in our current data processes?2.a. How do I lay the foundation for a future data engineering role, both in terms of learning and advocating for myself?b. What should I be learning in my spare time to get ready for data engineering tasks (i.e., Python concepts, ETL/ELT, AWS courses)?c. How do I effectively communicate the need for more proper Data Engineering tools/processes to the higher-ups and how do I make it clear I want to be doing that in the future?Sorry for the long post, and I'm aware of any red flags you see as well, but I need to stay in this role for at least a year or two (for my CV to have that fintech experience) so I want to make the best out of it. Thanks!",

        "content": "This is a problem I’ve been thinking about for quite some time, and I just can’t wrap my head around it.It’s generally recommended to partition data by the time it lands in S3 (i.e., event processing time) so that your pipelines are easier to make idempotent and deterministic. That makes sense operationally — but it creates a disconnect because business users don’t care about processing time; they care about event time.To complicate things further, it’s also recommended to keep your bronze layer append-only and handle deduplication downstream.So, I have three main questions:1. How would you approach partitioning in the bronze layer under these constraints?2. How would you design an efficient deduplication view on top of the bronze layer, given that it can contain duplicates and the business only cares about the latest record?3. Given that there might be intermediary steps in between, like dbt transformations when going from bronze to gold. How do you partition data in each layer so that your pipeline can scale? Is achieving idempotentcy and deterministic behavior at scale a huge challenge? I would be grateful if there are any resources on it that you can point me towards too?",

I have basic understanding of models and model architecture but have a good handle on with the recent LLM integration/workflow frameworks like Langchain, Langtrace etc. Currently, while looking for a change, I am seeing much more demand in Data which makes total sense to me with the direction industry is heading. I am wondering how should i get myself more framed as a Data engineering leader than the generic engineering leader role. I have done some LinkedIn basic trainings but seems like i will need a little more indepth knowledge as my past hands on experience has been in Java, nodejs and cloud native architectures.

Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all. Can someone please give me some insights on modern techniques if my suspicions are correct?",

I am trying to simply understand how to structure a DWH using **medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) across **multiple environments** (Dev / Test / Prod).Now, with the last company I worked with, they simply had two databases, staging, and production. Staging is basically the data lake and they transformed all the data to production. I understand this is not best practice. I thought if I wanted to have a proper structure in my DWH, I was thinking of this:DWH |\\-> StagingDB -> BronzeSchema, SilverSchema, GoldSchema\\-> TestDB -> BronzeSchema, SilverSchema, GoldSchema\\-> ProdDB -> BronzeSchema, SilverSchema, GoldSchemaWould you even create a bronze layer on staging and test DBs or not really? I mean it is just the raw data no?",

        "author": "SoloArtist91",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys, looking for feedback on a potential setup. For context, we are a medium sized company and our data department consists of me, my boss and one other analyst. I'm the most technical one, the other two can connect to a database in Tableau and that's about it. I'm fairly comfortable writing Python scripts and SQL queries, but I am not a software engineer.We currently have MS SQL Server on prem that was set up a decade ago and is reaching its end of life in terms of support. For ETL, we've been using Alteryx for about as long as that, and for reporting we have Tableau Server. We don't have that much data (550GB total), and we ingest about 50k rows an hour in batched CSV files that our vendors send us. This data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned up before a database can ingest it.With the SQL Server getting old and our renewal conversations with Alteryx going extremely poorly, my boss has directed me to research options for replacing both, or scaling Alteryx down to just the last mile for Tableau Server. Our main purposes are 1) upgrade our data warehouse to something with as little maintenance as possible and 2) continue to serve our Tableau dashboards 3) make ad-hoc analysis in Tableau possible for my boss and the other analyst. Ideally, we'd keep our costs to under 70k a year.So far I've played around with Databricks, Clickhouse, Prefect, Dagster, and have started doing the dbt fundementals courses to get a better idea of it. While I liked Databricks's unity catalog and time travel capabilities of delta tables, the price and computing power of spark seems like overkill for our purposes/size. It felt like I was spending a lot of time spinning up clusters and frivolously spending cash working out the syntax.Clickhouse caught my eye since it promises fast query times, it is easy enough to set up and put together a sample pipeline together, and the cloud database offering seems cheaper than DBX. It's nice that dbt-core can be used with it as well, because just writing queries and views inside the cloud console there seems like it can get hairy and confusing really fast.So far, I'm thinking that we can run local Python scripts for ingesting data into Clickhouse staging tables, then write views on top of those for the cleaner silver + gold tables and let Alteryx/analysts connect to those. The tricky part with CH is how it manages upserts/deletions behind the scenes, but I think with ReplacingMergeTrees and solid queries, we could get around those limitations. It's also less forgiving with schema drift and inferring data types.So my questions are as follows:* Does my approach make sense? * Are there other products worth looking into for my use case?* How do you guys evaluate the feasibility of a setup when the tools are new to you?* Is Clickhouse in your experience a solid product that will be around for the next 5-10 years?Thank you for your time.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!Assume I got a huge dataset of crawled internet webpages, and I'd like to transform them page by page doing some kind of filtration, pre-processing, tokenization etc. Let's say that original dataset is stored along some metainformation in form of parquet files in S3.Coming from enterprises, I have some background in Apache ecosystem as well as some older Big Tech MapReduce-kinda data warehouses, so my first idea was to use Spark to define those transformations using some scala/python code and just deal with it in batch processing manner. But before doing it \"classic ETL-style\" way, I decided to check some more modern (trending?) data stacks that are out there.I learned about Modal. They seem to be claiming about revolutionizing data processing, but I am not sure how exactly the practical usecases of data processing are expressed in them. Therefore, a bunch of questions to the community:1. They don't provide a notion of \"dataframes\", nor know anything about my input datasets, thus I must be responsible for somehow partitioning of the input into chunks, right? Like, reading slices of parquet file if needed, or coalescing groups of parquet files together before running an actual distributed computation?2. What about fault-tolerance? Spark has implemented protocols for atomic output commit, how do you expose result of a distributed data processing atomically without producing garbage from restarted jobs when using Modal? Do I, again, implement this manually?3. Is there any kind of long-running data processing operation state snapshotting? (not saying about individual executors, but rather the application master) If I have a CPU intensive computation running for 24 hours and I close my laptop lid, or the initiator host dies some other way, am I automatically screwed?4. Are there tweaks like speculative execution, or at least a way how to control/abort individual function executions? It is always a pity to see how 99% of a job finished with high concurrency and last couple of tasks ended up on some faulty host and take eternity to finish. 5. Since they are a cloud service - do you know about their actual scalability limits? I have a computation CPU cluster of \\~25k CPU cores in my company, do they have some comparable fleet? It would be quite stupid to hit into some limitation like \"no more than 1000 cpu cores per user unless you are an enterprise folk paying $20k/month just for a license\"... 6. Also, them being non-opensource also makes it harder to understand what exactly happens under the hood, are there any open-source competitors to them? Or at least a way how to bring them on-premise to my company's fleet?And a more generic question – has any of you folks ever tried actually processing some huge datasets with them? Right now it looks more like a tool for smaller developer experiments, or for time-slicing GPUs for seconds, but not something that I would use to build a reliable data pipeline over. But maybe I am missing something. PS I was told Ray also became popular recently, and they seem to be open-source as well, so will check them later as well.",

        "author": "lancejpollard",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "General problem I'm been considering in the back of my head, when trying to figure out how to make some sort of interactive web UI for various language texts, and allow text annotation, and text editing (to progressively/slowly clean up the text mistakes over time, etc.). But in a way such a way that, if you or someone edits the text down the road, it won't mess up the annotations and stuff like that?I don't know much about linguistic annotation software (saw [this brief overview of some options](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/text-annotation-labeling-tools/#1-labellerr)), but what I've looked at so far are basically these:- [Perseus Greek Texts](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0227) (click on individual words to lookup)- [Prodigy demo](https://demo.prodi.gy/?=null&view_id=pos_manual) (on of the text annotation tools I could quickly try in basic mode for free)- [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/articulus) (double click to visit terms anywhere in the text)But the general problem I'm getting stuck on in my head is what I was saying, here is a brief example to clarify:- Say we are working with the Bible text (bunch of books, divided into chapters, divided into verses)- The data model I'm considering at this point is a tree of JSON basically, `text_section` can be arbitrarily nested (bible -> book -> chapter), and then at the end are `text_span` in the children (verses here).- Say the Bible unicode text is super messy, random artifacts here and there, extra whitespace and punctuation in various spots, overall the text is 90% good quality but could use months or years of fine-tuned polish to clean it up and make it perfect. (Sefaria texts, open-source Hebrew texts, are super-super messy, tons of textual artifacts that could use some love to clean up and stuff eventually over time... for example.).- But say you can also annotate the text at any point, creating probably \"selection_ranges\" of text within or across verses, etc.. Then you can label or do whatever to add metadata to those ranges.Problem is:- Text is being cleaned up over say a couple years, a few minor tweaks every day.- Annotations are being added every day too.Edge-case is basically this:- Annotation is added on some selected text- Text gets edited (maybe user is not even aware of or focused on the annotation UI at this point, but under the hood the metadata is still there).- Editor removes some extra whitespace, and adds a missing word (as they found say by looking at a real manuscript scan).- Say the editor added `Newton` to `Isaac`, so whereas before it said `foo bar Isaac ... baz`, now it says `foo bar Isaac Newton baz`.- Now the annotation sort of changes meaning, and needs to be redone (this is a terrible example, I tried thinking of what my mind's stumbling on, but can't quite pin it down totally yet).- Should say `foo bar Isaac Newton baz` let's say (but the editor never sees anything annotation-wise...)Basically, trying to show that, the annotations can get messed up, and I don't see a systematic way to handle or resolve that if editing the text is also allowed.You can imagine other cases where some annotation marks like a phrase or idiom, but then the editor comes and changes the idiom to be something totally different, or just partially different, whatever. Or splits the annotation somehow, etc..Basically, have apps or anyone figured out generally how to handle this general problem? How to not make it so when you edit, you have to just delete the annotations, but it somehow smart merges, or flags it for double-checking, etc.. Basically there is a lot to think through functionality-wise, and I'm not sure if it's already been done before. It's both a data-modeling problem, and a UI/UX problem. But mainly concerned about the technical data-modeling problem here.",

I interned last summer at a big company and then started working in my first FT data role as a data analyst at a small company (I’m about 6 months in). My goal is to eventually move into Data Science/ML maybe ML engineer and end up in big tech.Option A: Data Engineer I* Industry: Finance. This one pays $15k more. I’ll be working with a smaller team and I’d be the main technical person on the team. So no strong mentorship and I’ll have the pressure to “figure it out” on my own. Option B: Senior Data Analyst* Industry: retail at a large org.I’m nervous about being the only engineer on a team this early in my career…But I’m also worried about not being technical enough as a data analyst and not being technical. What would you do in my shoes?Go hard into engineering now and level up fast even if it’s stressful without much support? Or take the analyst role at a big company, build brand and transition later?Would appreciate any advice from people who’ve been on either path.",

        "content": "Thoughts on using Synthetic Data for Projects ?I'm currently a DB Specialist with 3 YOE learning Spark, DBT, Python, Airflow and AWS to switch to DE roles.I’d love some feedback on a portfolio project I’m working on. It’s basically a modernized spin on the kind of work I do at my job, a Transaction Data Platform with a multi-step ETL pipeline.Quick overview of setup:DB structure:Dimensions = Bank -> Account -> RoutingFact = Transactions -> Transaction\\_StepsHistory = Hist_Transactions -> Hist_Transaction_Steps (identical to fact tables, just one extra column) I mocked up 3 regions -> 3 banks per region -> 3 accounts per bank -> 702 unique directional routings.A Python script first assigns following parameters to each routing:type (High Intensity/Frequency/Normal)country\\_code, region, cross\\_borderbase\\_freq, base\\_amount, base\\_latency, base\\_successvolatility vars (freq/amount/latency/success)Then the synthesizer script uses above paramters to spit out 85k-135k records per day, and 5x times Transaction\\_Steps Anomaly engine randomly spikes volatility (50–250x) \\~5 times a week for a random routing, the aim is (hopefully) the pipeline will detect the anomalies.Pipeline workflow:Batch runs daily (simulating off business hours migration).Every day data older than 1 month in live table is moved to history tables (partitioned by day and OLTP compressed) Then the partitions older than a month in history tables are exported to Parquet (maybe I'll create a Data lake or something) cold storage and stored. The current day's transactions are transformed through DBT, to generate 12 marts, helping in anomaly detection and system monitoring A Great Expectation + Python layer takes care of data quality and Anomaly detectionFinally for visualization and ease of discussion I'm generating a streamlit dashboard from above 12 marts.Main concerns/questions:1. Since this is just inspired by my current work (I didn’t use real table names/logic, just the concept), should I be worried about IP/overlap ?2. I’ve done a barebones version of this in shell+SQL, so I personally know business and technical requirements and possible issues in this project, it feels really straightforward. Do you think this is a solid enough project to showcase for DE roles at product-based-companies / fintechs (0–3 YOE range)?3. Thoughts on using synthetic data? I’ve tried to make it noisy and realistic, but since I’ll always have control, I feel like I'm missing something critical that only shows up in real-world messy data?Would love any outside perspectiveThis would ideally be the portfolio project, and there's one more planned using spark where I'm just cleaning and merging Spotify datasets from different types (CSV, json, sqlite, parquet etc) from Kaggle, it's just a practice project to showcase spark understanding. **TLDR:** Built a synthetic transaction pipeline (750k+ txns, 3.75M steps, anomaly injection, DBT marts, cold storage). Looking for feedback on:* IP concerns (inspired by work but no copied code/keywords)* Whether it’s a strong enough DE project for Product Based Companies and Fintech. * Pros/cons of using synthetic vs real-world messy data",

        "author": "Mysterious-Sky5410",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working at a WITCH company for about a year now, as a Data Engineer. I’ve been in the same project throughout, where I mainly handle support tasks— documentation, debugging, adding columns, updating views, ensuring data flow, and just ensuring everything runs smoothly. Essentially, I’m not involved in any real development work like building pipelines or writing scripts.I’ve seen a lot of posts about people in similar situations, like the one here [Need career advice – Am I a Data Engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1nf3h0u/need_career_advice_am_i_a_data_engineer_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , and it feels like I’m in the same boat. The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.Another challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.I see two possible options right now:Ask to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.Resign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.So, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here? I don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.Appreciate any insights or suggestions!TL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new. Should I ask to be released from my project (with no guarantee of better work) or resign and serve the notice period while job hunting (despite the risk of unemployment)?",

        "content": "Hey folks, I need to pick your brains to brainstorm a potential solution to my problem.Current stack: SparkSQL (Databricks SQL), storage in Delta, modeling in dbt.I have a pipeline that generally works like this: WITH a AS (SELECT * FROM table) SELECT a.*, 'one' AS type FROM a UNION ALL SELECT a.*, 'two' AS type FROM a UNION ALL SELECT a.*, 'three' AS type FROM aThe source table is partitioned on a column, let's say column \\`date\\`, and the output is stored also with partition column \\`date\\` (both with Delta). The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \\`BroadcastHashJoin\\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.I had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\\*\\*ks up the performance.**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \\`date\\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.I have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",

        "content": "Hello,I'm seeking help with a bad situation I have with Synapse + Azure storage (ADLS2).The situation: I'm forced to use Synapse notebooks for certain data processing jobs; a couple of weeks ago I was asked to create a pipeline to download some financial data from a public repository and output it to Azure storage.Said data is very small, a few Megabytes at most. So I first developed the script locally, used Polars for dataframe interface and once I verified everything worked, I put it online.# EditApparently I failed to explain myself since nearly everyone who answered, implicitly thinks I'm an idiot, so while I'm not ruling that option out I'll just simplify:* I have some code that reads data from an online API and writes it somewhere.* The data is a few MBs.* I'm using Polars, not Pyspark* Locally it runs in one minute.* On Synapse it runs in 7 minutes.* Yes, I did account for pool spin up time, it takes 7 minutes after the pool is ready.* Synapse and storage account are in the same region.* I am FORCED to use Synapse notebooks by the organization I'm working for.* I don't have details about networking at the moment as I wasn't involved in the setup, I'd have to collect them.Now I understand that data transfer goes over the network, so it's gotta be slower than writing to disk, but what the fuck? 5 to 10 times slower is insane, for such a small amount of data.This also makes me think that the Spark jobs that run in the same environment would be MUCH faster in a different setup.So this said, the question is, is there anything I can do to speed up this shit?# Edit 2Under suggestion of some of you I then profiled every component of the pipeline, which eventually confirmed the suspicion that the bottleneck is in the I/O part.Here's the relevant profiling results if anyone is interested:### local```_write_parquet: Calls: 1713 Total: 52.5928s Avg: 0.0307s Min: 0.0003s Max: 1.0037s_read_parquet (this is an extra step used for data quality check): Calls: 1672 Total: 11.3558s Avg: 0.0068s Min: 0.0004s Max: 0.1180sdownload_zip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 44.7885s Avg: 2.0358s Min: 1.6840s Max: 2.2794sunzip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 1.7265s Avg: 0.0785s Min: 0.0577s Max: 0.1197sread_csv: Calls: 2074 Total: 17.9278s Avg: 0.0086s Min: 0.0004s Max: 0.0410stransform (includes read_csv time): Calls: 846 Total: 20.2491s Avg: 0.0239s Min: 0.0012s Max: 0.2056s```### synapse```_write_parquet: Calls: 1713 Total: 848.2049s Avg: 0.4952s Min: 0.0428s Max: 15.0655s_read_parquet: Calls: 1672 Total: 346.1599s Avg: 0.2070s Min: 0.0649s Max: 10.2942sdownload_zip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 14.9234s Avg: 0.6783s Min: 0.6343s Max: 0.7172sunzip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 5.8338s Avg: 0.2652s Min: 0.2044s Max: 0.3539sread_csv: Calls: 2074 Total: 70.8785s Avg: 0.0342s Min: 0.0012s Max: 0.2519stransform (includes read_csv time): Calls: 846 Total: 82.3287s Avg: 0.0973s Min: 0.0037s Max: 1.0253s```### context:`_write_parquet`: writes to local storage or adls.`_read_parquet`: reads from local storage or adls.`download_zip_data`: downloads the data from the public source to a local `/tmp/data` directory.

        "author": "echanuda",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know this isn't a sub specifically for technical questions, but I'm really at a loss here. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.Disclaimer that this problem is with delta-rs (in Python), not Delta Lake with Databricks.The project is simple: We have a Delta table, and we want to update some records.The solution: use the merge functionality. dt = DeltaTable(\"./table\") updates_df = get_updates() dt.merge( updates_df, predicate=( \"target.pk = source.pk\" \"AND target.salt = source.salt\" \"AND target.foo = source.foo\" \"AND target.bar != source.bar\" ), source_alias=\"source\", target_alias=\"target\", ).when_matched_update( updates={\"bar\": \"source.bar\"} ).execute()The above code is essentially a simplified version of what I have, but all the core pieces are there. It's quite simple in general. The delta table in `./table` is very very large, but it is partitioned nicely with around 1M records per partition (salted to get the partitions balanced). Overall there's \\~2B records in there, while `updates_df` has 2M.The problem is that the merge operation balloons memory **massively** for some reason. I was under the impression that working with partitions would drastically decrease the memory consumption, but no. It eventually OOMs, exceeding 380G. This doesn't make sense. Doing a join on the same column between the two tables with duckdb, I find that there would be \\~120k updates across 120 partitions (there are a little over 500 partitions). For one, duckdb can handle the join just fine, and two, it's working with such a small amount of updates. How is it using so much? The partitioned columns are `pk` and `salt`, which I am using in the predicate, so I don't think it has anything to do with lack of pruning.If anyone has any experience with this or the solution is glaringly obvious (never used Delta before), then I'd love to hear your thoughts. Oh and if you're wondering why I don't use a more conventional solution for this - that's not my decision. And even if it were, now I'm just curious at this point.",

I’m pointing out my coding/programming background to show I barely have any knowledge, when I was learning those languages I barely had any projects except when I was learning html and css in which I posted very beginner like web pages, task bars etc. I really don’t want to get dependent on AI due to the fact on different subreddits I see people say they hire swe’s or software developers and they aren’t able to code at all, I don’t want that to be me, even though AI has been around for a while now I want to act like it’s still 2010s-2020 when people were learning how to code without the use of tools like that, another reason is that my degree is more tailored to practical and applied programming than it is to theory and mathematics, towards my second semester of first year and second year I’ll be doing less of mathematics & computer science theory and more of Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Object Oriented programming, Databases. I don’t want to GPT my way through this degree, I want to know why and how things work, I want to be able to actually critically think and problem solve, I’m not saying people who use AI cannot do this, I’ve heard several senior developers implement these tools in their day to day activities, but I’m saying as a beginner with a foundation which is not so sturdy, if I do rely on AI as a tool or teacher, I might get too dependent on it maybe that’s just a skill issue on my end :grinning_face_with_sweat:. I noticed C is a bit different from these languages cause C is more backend language and is used for compiling, I wouldn’t say it’s a hard language to learn but it’s definitely tricky for me, I don’t really want to use AI to learn it, apart from W3Schools and Youtube videos which other resources like books, blogs, websites can I use to learn this language?",

What’s wrong with admitting you don’t know something and asking for guidance from seniors before taking up critical projects?This isn't about AI being good or bad it's about developers using AI as a replacement for skill, not a tool to enhance it.",

        "content": "I'm currently an undergraduate MIS major planning to pursue my master's degree. This semester, I started taking an entry level Python course required for my major, and honestly, I've never been this confused in a college class before as a junior.It's been about two months, and I still feel completely lost. My professor teaches by using Microsoft Copilot to write all of the code, and then explains to the class what Copilot generated. I've been completing all my assignments using Copilot as well, since that's what the professor expects.However, one day we had a substitute professor who didn't use Copilot. He broke down each function and explained what everything did, and that was the first time I actually understood what was going on.Lately, I've been seriously considering whether this major is the right fit for me. If this is what the rest of the program is like, i'm not sure I'll enjoy or even fully understand what I'm supposed to be learning. I don't want to switch majors just because of one bad experience, but it's starting to make me question if this field is really what I want to pursue longterm.So now I'm wondering is this kind of Al heavy teaching normal for coding classes in 2025, and I'm just behind? Or is the professor not teaching correctly.",

I watch senior developers work, navigating massive codebases, writing complex logic line by line by themselves with without AI, debugging like it’s second nature, and I’m in awe. They don’t lean on AI for every line, they just know. And I can’t help but wonder: Will I ever get there?Here’s the raw truth: I’ve relied on AI, tutorials, copy-paste solutions, and the environment around me encourages that. It’s fast, it works, but it’s not helping me learn, not really. I feel like I’m trading understanding for convenience, and it scares me that I might never reach the level of independence I admire in senior developers.I want to break that cycle. I want to think in code, solve problems from scratch, read a complex system and understand it fully. I want to be the programmer who doesn’t just get things working, but truly knows why and how.So I’m asking you all:1. How do I build the mindset to stop relying on AI and tutorials for every step?2. What habits or exercises actually make you confident in writing code from scratch?3. How do you go from feeling lost in a project to navigating it like a second brain?I’m ready to put in the work.

I really enjoy how they make programming and computer science seem fun and simple, the professor is very good at explaining concepts no matter how difficult or unfamiliar they are. Things like memory management in C or data structures and algorithms were very easily explained, David Malan (the professor) is a very energetic and enthusiastic teacher but he explains his thoughts very clearly, he does a very good job at explaining these concepts visually and conceptually. Things that I was scared of getting stuck on became very simple once they were explained, David Malan is a very good teacher.I also really enjoyed the problem sets. They were very well made and thought out, they're not too easy like some of the other coding courses that say things like \"print hello world\", \"create a variable and print it\", no with CS50 every problem set is a mini-project(s). It's not too hand-holding like other courses where it feels like you're following instructions instead of building, no you get an explanation, you get a demo of how the final product should look, sometimes you get a short walkthrough or some hints, but at the end of the day it's all about you seeking the answer yourself and working through the problem. Some problem sets are unique and fun like I really enjoyed Fiftyville and Readability.Expanding on the last point, I really like how they focus on the problem solving aspect of programming. As a developer you don't get paid to code but to solve problems. I really enjoyed how they didn't encourage AI to write code or to be the main source of learning, no they really want you to read documentation, research and do rubber duck debugging, they encourage figuring things out yourself and that is such an important skill to learn.Another thing I enjoyed was how easy their tools were to use. Just make a Github account and connect it to the CS50 codespace. They document and explain their tools like submit50 and check50 very well. I think that if tomorrow you start CS50 and it's your first day programming, it would be very straightforward to get started with the CS50 tools.Now, the course isn't particularly easy, simple and easy aren't the same thing. If you have no experience with computer science then CS50 could be a bit difficult at first since they get you up and running QUICK, I mean they start talking about algorithms and memory management by around week 3 and 4 and so yeah this is definitely not a course that I would say is \"easy\", but the professor is very good at explaining concepts and if you just stay consistent and you keep going it'll be worth it. It actually gets easier from week 6 and onwards, in my opinion.Overall, it's a great course. Heck, I wouldn't even be mad if this course costed money. If you're thinking of taking an easy to follow, free, fun course full of learning opportunities then I think CS50 is great, there is not really much of anything that I disliked, everything was super straight forward and simple.",

I do understand that the official docs also send you off to learn JS, just unsure in what capacity.Any JS resource I've looked at is largely comprehensive and not something I want to commit to. I've of course done a lot of prior research over the past week and have decided on tools that are TS-first, like Vue or Solid and potentially Astro eliminating the need for Nuxt, where I think Fastify for the backend would be a nice tool to learn, or just go for Nuxt over Fastify if learning something more performant like Go Standard Library in the future.As for TS resources, there's a couple that are thrown around, one of which is the official doc/handbook and the second is the Total TypeScript course, money isn't a concern in the slightest if the learning's worth it and I can come out of it being able to hold my own.I have a bit of C knowledge, nothing of exceptional note though. Would be nice to start learning something that's favored and will be favored in the future and is simply the better of the two rather than what's phasing out, at least in terms of writing code, although I do acknoledge that JS is still the underlying engine and holy grail.",

And if my take on the subject does matter, I would say it is important to be more business-oriented so you can understand the value you bring to companies because at the end of the day that is why we get hired. Nobody hires someone so they can have a salary. You just gotta prove to them that you are worth the investment.These are just my thoughts but if I am wrong please do correct me :)",

I don’t think I can seriously learn .NET, Java, and C++ at the same time without ending up doing all of them poorly.I’m also a bit worried about the job market — I’m afraid that if I invest heavily in .NET, I might miss out on opportunities that exist with Java (since Java seems to be more widely used in many companies).So I’d really appreciate some honest, strategic advice: which direction would make the most sense in the long run for someone who wants to get into backend development?Thanks a lot :folded_hands:",

        "content": "My son (10 years old now) started his coding adventure with the typical things that kids use - block based tools like scratch.When he outgrew those, he moved on to learn open web technologies. His first two games were built using just HTML, CSS, JS using divs, images and sound apis. Huge learning curve, and still limited in what you can do. It didn't stop him though. More importantly, it taught him the fundamentals (arrays, variables, file management, functions, etc), and there's a lot of value in that.He wanted to do more advanced stuff, and started learning how to use canvas with requestAnimationFrame. He even started thinking about what a collision detection algorithm would look like (with the help of AI). He never passed the experimentation phase here so a game wasn't released. But he learned a lot more about the fundamentals. In all the above, he did have support & guidance from parents. So I think having the right mentorship in place is key.Along the way, he discovered a game engine (Microsoft Makecode Arcade) which, while limited, gave him so much to build on - tilemaps, input management, animations, integrated sound/image editor, gravity, etc. Suddenly, his games could become more complex. Levels, hidden sections and boss battles were all easily approachable.From my observation, picking up the game engine was easy. He already loosely knew what needed to happen, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do it in the engine.What I'm trying to say: when you want to learn to code, using a game engine on day one will speed you up, but it may also mean you're skipping some valuable fundamentals. Perhaps, instead, start smaller and explore. Learn the fundamentals and build on it until you naturally are hitting the limits and need something more powerful.My son also did a writeup on his experience using a game engine - [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/)(Disclosure -  Parents provided multiple rounds of feedback to ensure clarity and coherence of his writeup)",

But then i remember my interest in mobile app development. And it's always the same loop: start with one, continue with another language, and finally learn something different until the loop starts again. I do have the basic programming knowledge of loops, functions, etc. But i'm not a master of one specific language. Now i am wondering whether im even suitable for learning programming? On one hand i think yes, because the interest keeps coming back even though i took a break from it. On the other hand, no because i cant seem to focus and master one language. Am i the only one having this struggle? Is there some way i can fix myself to master one language?",

Understanding the theory is easy, but writing the code always gets me stumped.I don’t want to start from linked lists since I think I’ve already grasped them. They’re pretty straightforward and damn linear. I even made a little jumping rabbit game from them!I really want to go **from zero to hero** with trees, starting from the basics all the way up to decision trees and random forests. Do you guys happen to know any good websites or structured paths where I can practice this step by step?Something like this kind of structure would really help:1. **Binary Trees:** learn basic insert, delete, and traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)2. **Binary Search Trees (BST):** building, searching, and balancing3. **Heaps:** min/max heap operations and priority queues4. **Tree Traversal Problems:** BFS, DFS, and recursion practice5. **Decision Trees:** how they’re built and used for classification6. **Random Forests**: coding small examples and understanding ensemble logicCould you provide some links to resources where I can follow a similar learning path or practice structure?Thanks in advance!",

Not everything we work on goes to master — some modules can’t be shown in production yet, so they remain in development.Previously, I refactored a large existing system from a single repo to a **multi-repo setup**: one repository per module (`auth`, `event`, `cms`, etc.) plus a shared components library published to npm. Each project is deployed on its own subdomain.That setup has worked quite well overall, but it has its pros and cons:* PRs don’t interfere with each other, so I can push some changes to production without affecting other projects.* The shared library isn’t a problem since it doesn’t get updated often.* There’s some repetitive code like interfaces, hooks, and constants.* When the shared library does change, I have to manually bump and update the version in every repo (`event`, `auth`, etc.) to avoid version mismatches — a bit annoying.* Each repo has its own CI/CD pipeline; it’s repetitive but helps ensure that if one build fails, the others still deploy fine.# For this new project, I’m considering a monorepo: apps/ base/ community/ registration/ store/ packages/ ui/ hooks/ interfaces/ utils/Everything in one workspace (using Bun/Turborepo)**My main doubts are:*** My intention is to use a monorepo, but my main questions are:* If only one app or a single change is ready for production, how is that usually managed in a shared repository?* How do you handle CI/CD for multiple apps and the shared core (packages like hooks, ui, etc.)?* Would you recommend a monorepo or a multi-repo setup with a shared npm package?# Stack* Next.js 15 (app router)* TypeScript* React Query / GraphQL / API Rest* Bun / Turborepo* CI/CD with Azure Pipelines",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to make a function that assigns note names to musical scales which are represented by binary numbers. For example, the expected output for a scale 1001011100101 with a root of F would be F Ab Bb B C Eb F (for musical theory reasons).To do this I wrote a recursive function that attempts different scale spellings and returns the one with the lowest cost (e.g. F G# G## Bb Cb C C### F should have a higher cost). However I'm struggling with the recursion as its assigning unexpected costs to certain notes.Specifically at the calculate cost section (line 41). The function returns \\[('F', 0), ('Ab', 0), ('Bb', 0), ('Cb', 0), ('Dbb', 3), ('Eb', 0), ('F', 0)\\]). However I'm not sure why Cb has a cost of 0 and Dbb has a cost of 3. I would like them to be B and C which should have lower costs than Cb and Dbb.The idea behind the helper functions NameScalesEnharmonicRoots and NameScalesKeySignatures are to try different enharmonic roots (e.g. F# and Gb) for a scale and return the one with the lowest cost and to try to fit scales to key signatures to try to be accurate with music theory.Are there any recursion gurus who can help me out?Here is my code: def NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode): keys = ['C','C#','Db','D','D#','Eb','E','F','F#','Gb','G','G#','Ab','A','A#','Bb','B'] # get the pitches of the scale pitches = [] for i in range(len(binary)): if binary[i]=='1': pitches.append(i) # get the pitches of the major scale if 'b' in tonic: diatonic = [1] elif '#' in tonic: diatonic = [-1] else: diatonic = [0] for i in range(7): if (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('E') or (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('B'): diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+1) else: diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+2) def AssignNotes(pitch, letter, lastNote=''): # base case if pitch == len(pitches): if lastNote and lastNote in keys: return (0,'', []) return (float('inf'), '', []) if (letter > 7): return (float('inf'), '', []) # get the note currentLetterNum = (ord(tonic[0])+letter-65)%7+65 accidentals = pitches[pitch]-diatonic[letter] if accidentals == 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) elif accidentals < 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + 'b'*(-accidentals) elif accidentals > 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + '#'*accidentals # calculate cost if note in majorMode: totalCost = 0 else: totalCost = abs(accidentals)+1 totalStr = note totalList = [(note,totalCost)] if pitch == len(pitches)-1: currentLastNote = note else: currentLastNote = lastNote # recursive calls nextCost, nextStr, nextList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter+1,currentLastNote) totalCost += nextCost if nextStr != '': totalStr = note + '&ensp;' + nextStr totalList += nextList skipCost, skipStr, skipList = AssignNotes(pitch,letter+1,lastNote) doubleUpCost, doubleUpStr, doubleUpList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter,currentLastNote) if doubleUpCost != float('inf'): doubleUpCost += totalCost + abs(accidentals) + 1 if doubleUpStr != '': doubleUpStr = note + '&ensp;' +doubleUpStr doubleUpList = [(note,totalCost)]+doubleUpList # choose the path with the minimum cost minCost = min(totalCost,skipCost,doubleUpCost) if minCost == totalCost: return (totalCost, totalStr,totalList) elif minCost == skipCost: return (skipCost,skipStr,skipList) elif minCost == doubleUpCost: return (doubleUpCost,doubleUpStr,doubleUpList) return AssignNotes(0,0,'') # get the parent mode def NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary): orderOfSharps = ['F#','C#','G#','D#','A#','E#'] orderOfFlats = ['Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb','Cb'] flatKeys = ['C','F','Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb'] sharpKeys = ['C','G','D','A','E','B','F#','C#','G#','D#','A#'] lowestScale = None lowestCost = 9999999999999 for i in range(-5,2): if tonic in sharpKeys: accidentals = sharpKeys.index(tonic)+i elif tonic in flatKeys: accidentals = -flatKeys.index(tonic)+i if accidentals > 0: keySignature = orderOfSharps[:accidentals] elif accidentals < 0: keySignature = orderOfFlats[:abs(accidentals)] else: keySignature = [] # build the notes of the scale by character number and then add sharps and flats to them as they appear in the key signature majorMode = [] for j in range(7): letter = chr((ord(tonic[0])+j-65)%7+65) for k in keySignature: if letter in k: letter = k majorMode.append(letter) currentScale = NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode) if currentScale[0] < lowestCost: lowestCost = currentScale[0] lowestScale = currentScale print(majorMode) print(lowestScale) return lowestScale # get the tonic def NameScalesEnharmonicRoots(tonic,binary): enharmonics = [['C',''], ['F',''], ['Bb','A#'], ['Eb','D#'], ['Ab','G#'], ['Db','C#'], ['Gb','F#'], ['B',''], ['E',''], ['A',''], ['D',''], ['G','']] print(tonic,binary) scale = NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary) scaleNotes = scale[1] scaleKey = tonic for keys in enharmonics: if tonic in keys: enharmonic = keys[:] enharmonic.remove(tonic) enharmonicTonic = enharmonic[0] if enharmonicTonic: scaleEnharmonic = NameScalesKeySignatures(enharmonicTonic,binary) if scaleEnharmonic[0] < scale[0]: scaleNotes = scaleEnharmonic[1] scaleKey = enharmonicTonic return (scaleKey,scaleNotes) print(NameScalesEnharmonicRoots('F','1001011100101'))",

I took intro to Java and algorithms in undergrad, so I know a small amount of the syntax, but is memorizing the syntax what makes you proficient enough to use programming professionally? I’m curious what I should do to further my skills as someone who has no plans on entering the R&D or engineering aspects of my trade as that’s what more intense learning like boot camps are for.",

I took the CS50x course and wrote my own Python code for the backend in the PSets, which queried the database, hashed passwords when creating accounts, authenticated from the database when logging in, and routed back to home, etc. So, why use Firebase instead?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere before and I'm just too dumb to see it, but how do I go about doing something like this? As an example, I'm working on a site for a club I'm in and while the site itself is huge and probably needs most of its pages manually coded in (I'm using React), there's one section in particular where it could easily become a mess to do that. Basically, there's an \"Events\" section which features a bunch of links to Current and Past Events that the club has hosted and clicking on any of them takes you to a dedicated event page. All of the event pages have more or less the same structure. I can't imagine having to create pages for each of them manually and then route them all to individual endpoints; it sounds very backwards. I mean, there's no way the guys at Youtube are hand-crafting pages for each of it's videos on the database and then manually connecting a million routes. So what's the solution here?I heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?Also, what to do if I wanted to add some unique flair to some of the event pages (but not all) while still maintaining most of the structure? (Say for example, one event page has a different background colour than the rest, or has a few divs here and there that the others don't have) Would I be able to customise without having to break out of the system?",

Being able to do a lot with less like addition and multiplication is fun.My programming setup usually starts (whatever \"language\" or similar things like LaTeX) with a text editor and two to three terminals open. One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. But understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next. I still have huge issues with VS code because usually the problems I get are related to git or access privileges in the background. If Mac OS was not a full blown Unix I would have been lost at work.

I'm not sure I am interested in web development since I feel like it's far off from mechanical engineering but maybe I'm wrong?I've also thought maybe some more Python courses on data science but I'm not sure which courses to take, if any. Are there any other areas in computer science that might overlap with mechanical engineering?",

So I want to jump into the deep end, and start learning C++, to get a proper deep level coding knowledge base.However... I want to find a way to learn that will give me some progressively more difficult, game based, coding projects along the way. I found the LearnC++ site which is absolutely awesome, but much too text heavy for me (I have ADHD/dyslexia) so want to find a balance between text and practice based learning.Can anyone point me to any relevant (and free/cheap) resources please, ones that will take me through the concepts progressively like LearnC++ does?

These were two options that I have found that may be able to provide what I need with some other steps for setting them up. Is there something that exists that achieves this already or should I set up scripts which generate data within a container or vm, I simply don't know if this is the right way to approach it. Thanks for the help. Edit: I have learned that spoofing hardware is what I am aiming to do. Simulate is apparently the wrong word. I will either use vm or potentially my antix usb on my other laptop.

I didn't really mind this but I have been thrown around from project to project without any being completed, I haven't had any resources.My main concerns are the following:* Not a single project has any form of docs whatsoever and this is something I wanted to learn about* I don't have a mentor* I don't even work with a senior* I don't even have my code reviewed* I work with a couple other juniors, whom don't work with the seniors either, and one heavily relies on AI so much that his code is always buggy and he doesn't know how to fix it* The director constantly uses AI to add code and pushes it to the main branch.* We only ever use one stack, which is redwoodjs, for every single project, or react native, expo if it's for mobile. No other tech stacks regardless of what the project is. Example of when this irked me a little, this last week I had to implement AI into one of the projects to read and automate docs. I wanted to use OCR, and felt like having a simple fastAPI server would've been beneficial as there are many great python packages to handle exactly what I needed but I was told to do so with react, of which packages to handle pdfs were hard to come by and many didn't support OCR from pdfs on react. It would also be nice to use other stacks and see where they benefit.I have tried other companies but I don't have a degree and every response I get is that I either need a degree or a few years of professional experience and I honestly don't believe that I'm getting that kind of experience with my internship",

I have basics down but as I'm approaching more complex problems, I have trouble finding resources to learn, and I would like to avoid re-inventing the wheel.I'm trying to build a front end layer to a linear solver, plugging in people, time slots, and work assignments to make a scheduler. I built out classes for each of these three things, and I want to make rule classes that will take in people, times, and work assignments, and generate the lower level elements to plug into the solver engine.I've done all that and it works, but I'm running into big picture questions:If I have a bunch of existing rules, people, times, work assignments, and I change/delete a person, then how do I ensure consistency in the rules that may reference that deleted person?Should rules contain value or reference links to the people/times/work assignments? Currently I used references (I understand these are pointers under the hood), but all of the reference links made it very hard for me to achieve the next step, which is saving the rules and everything to a file. I think I need to change the references to a key value that can be used to look up the person or whatever, like a GUID or other such key strategy.Is there any name for this or more complex programming in general that I can google to learn more about what I'm doing? I'm finding I'm building complex data structures but I don't really know what I'm doing, and it's a bit beyond a simple TODO app.",

I’m not a tech person btw, just recently started learning Python, so this whole process has been pretty challenging.I first tried using PRAW to collect posts and comments through Reddit’s API, but I quickly ran into rate limits and could only get around 57,000 posts. That’s nowhere near enough for proper analysis.Then I moved to Pushshift, which people said was easier for historical Reddit data, but it seems to be half-broken now. A lot of data is missing or incomplete, especially for the recent years. I also checked Hugging Face datasets, but most of them stop around 2021.I even looked at BigQuery, but it looks like that requires payment, and I couldn’t find any public dataset.If anyone has any suggestions or can share how they managed to get Reddit data for 2022 and beyond, I’d really appreciate it. I’m still learning Python, so any guidance or simple steps would help a lot.Please help!!",

I do it and it shortens the codebase significantly* That reused snippet doesn't do one single thing but several things, like * uses http client to perform apicall external service * extracts json, validates it * stores some value from json to redis* So here we can see 3 responsibilities in single function with explicit logic. So it violates single responsibility principle.* I can't even come up with relevant name for that function and end up with something like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` which is bs name. I know it and I can't help myself.* According to that principle I should not only split this function to 3 smaller ones. I do it. And function names are good.* But what should I do with old one? Let's assume I keep it so now it transformed to chain function. All it does is just calls 3 new functions consecutively.* But hey, now old function still does 3 things, not 1. So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.* But hey, now we lose in reusability. Like, what if entire chain had to be called not 3-4 times but 10 or 100 times instead?So here are options.* 1 function (max-DRY, no-SRP)* 4 functions (max-DRY, mid-SRP)* 3 functions (mid-DRY, max SRP)What would you chose and where am I wrong?",

I don't know if anything like I described exists, but I've seen long-ass videos of people tinkering with or hacking rare/old electronics and explaining what they're doing and why and those are fascinating and informative, so hoping I can find something similar for programming! Thanks! If you know some in a different language than Python that fits do tell me that one too.

        "content": "For the past 9 years, I’ve been stuck in legacy tech. I built niche monolithic apps with no exposure to distributed systems or system design. Time flew by, and I got pigeonholed in outdated “dinosaur” companies.Trying to leave my job was incredibly demoralizing. Thousands of job applications and a painfully low callback rate. I was discouraged by this and even more, by my background and lack of modern systems experience. I posted here asking how long it takes to prep for system design interviews from 0.  Many replies were disheartening, like “you need real on-the-job experience.” But it turns out…you don’t—at least not to pass interviews. Here’s what I did while working full-time:LeetCode (6 months): Focused on the top 150 problems, revisiting and practicing each one 4-5 times. (I failed many, many interviews along the way).System Design (1.5 months): Started from almost zero and crammed, studying about 15 systems deeply, mainly through videos and practice.Applications: Sent out over a thousand applications with very low callback. Landed interviews mostly through headhunters. Interviews (6 months): Juggled my full-time job while going through processes with 45 companies (failing most of them early on).It was brutal: endless rejections, self-doubt, and burnout. But I just landed 2 solid offers in AI (around 250k+ TC).If you’re in a similar rut, know that it is absolutely doable with consistent effort. You can break free even without the “right” background.

I think most bonafide engineers aren't super worried or impressed by the prior, but leadership is the one laying people off and changing internal gears.Then of course there is internal politics, general tech ego, and that entire game which has lead to not-uncommon internal blaming and resultant layoffs with someone having to take the heat.I feel bad for the 2019+ bootcamp grads that spent 5k+ on a camp to enter entry level.

But after I got laid off, it was like I never existed.I reached out to one person from my old team just to see how things were going there, and she completely ignored my message.

It made me feel so small, like I was begging for attention or validation when all I wanted was some human decency.I’m still early in my career, just a fresh grad, and this was my first real job. I was one of the top performers on the team too, so getting laid off and then being treated like that felt like a slap in the face.I know I’ll bounce back eventually, but man… this experience gave me a real taste of how cold things can get in the professional world.Has anyone else gone through something similar after being laid off?

I was laid off about a year ago and was super happy to find my current role as a software dev engineer about 4 months ago. My background is mostly backend web applications with some front end work (10%) Upon arrival I found out that I'll be part of a devops team which was not a huge issue for me, I've built CICD pipelines in the past and know the basics of what might be required.Anyway, about 2 months ago I got handed this high visibility project. Basically it is a massive application monorepo and I'm in charge of the pipeline for this project. I've have been struggling to get any support from the team that manages the application. And the person who has become my \"main contact\" is constantly out of office and I'm starting to notice that the delivery target for this pipeline will get delayed. Whenever I bring up any issues to my manager he immediately dismisses my concerns and his rebuttal is \"oh that's not an issue we can resolve it by xyz\" without actually understanding the concern I'm trying to raise. I suppose I could do a better job of not \"accepting\" his answer and trying to make my point clearer but anyway we are kinda past that.The other problem is that I've become a defacto project manager. My manager has told me to assign work to other team members and I've had to create a \"second standup\" outside of my main teams standup where we go over the tickets related to this project. My manager has set an aggressive timeline to deliver this project but I'm seeing that we will not be able to deliver it on his timeline and now I'm getting yelled at for delays. I wasn't really expecting to become a project manager for this role, I don't know how to go about dealing my manager who told me in a 1:1 that he would \"rather die than deliver this project late\"Any advice would be appreciated. On the one hand I'm thinking I can use this opportunity to learn about project management etc however I've started doing the \"project manager\" role really close to the deadline so now I'm getting people up to speed etc while we are expecting to go into production asap. But on the other I'm feeling quite overwhelmed and feeling like this was not my expectations for this role.Thanks for any advice in advance!!",

I’ve been sending out my resume all over the place but I’m struggling to get a lot of bites.I’m a back-end engineer who specializes in C#, .Net and some SQL, however I’m finding that a lot of the companies I’ve been applying for demand full-stack, but the problem is that I have very little UX experience. I had been meaning to get more into that while I was on my job, but I was never really given an opportunity to learn.I started a React course a couple of months ago but I’m having a difficult time maintaining my interest in it. I’m almost considering abandoning my job search and just focusing on the course just to get it done, but even then I’ll still have fairly minimal experience with React.The best results I’ve had so far have been individuals from recruiting companies pinging me on LinkedIn. Most of the time this results in me sending a resume to them for a contract job. I’ve had a few seem really promising but then ghost me after I get the resume. This last week I got in touch with a contractor who was looking for a position that just so happened to be with my first team at the tech company. They fast-tracked me into an interview that ran for far longer than it should have, and actually ran over what was supposed to be a second interview. The recruiter told me they would reschedule the second interview but I haven’t heard back from them. The team wants to have someone in the role by the end of this week but now I fear that even they might not be willing to take me back, even though they have my receipts, are probably using my code, and should know what I’m capable of.Any advice? I really don’t want to have to get a masters degree or change careers if I can help it.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my \"potential\" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. My manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).\"You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler.\" I never was.\"You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before\"\"You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.\"\"You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest\"Amongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?Another annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said \"we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?\". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.But the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? \"We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.\"So what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.Or, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.I have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",

        "content": "Back in the day when I mentioned CS and software dev I would get told how much money it made. After being a full time software dev for a fortune 500 company (not big tech) and making a little shy of 100k (65k take home) i have been struggling with personal finances. My mortgage and housing expenses is 40% of my budget, food is 20%, that doesn't leave much to even get ahead. I have a small 3 bed 1 bath in a poor neighborhood and I'm looking to move for a better school district and my budget is aimed at the worst houses in the market. My wife is disabled and a stay at home mom so I only have 1 income and I'm dealing with health issues myself that makes me not on top of my game.I studied hard 8 months last year for big tech jobs but when I went to apply I put in apps to all big tech companies I only got Amazon responding and I failed their initial screening due to it being a design problem rather than leetcode. Even tried applying to jobs that weren't big tech and don't get a call back.I could do a business or at least a micro saas for income but I have too much idea paralysis before starting. I could make anything with software and I make great full stack software but I don't have a GREAT idea for an undeserved market. I could specialize in a field in CS but I am a .NET/go dev with some full stack experience. I could go to a different field like cyber sec or data engineering but I don't know a good list of ones that pay more than software development. I am regarded as an up and comer in my organization and work well and hard, but I am underutilized and underpaid. They also don't have a lot of promotion cycles so I don't feel I'm getting promoted as quick as my skills. I should hit senior level within a year or so.TLDRJust feeling lost at the moment. I feel starting a business is the only way to get uncapped salary but get stuck with idea paralysis and undeserved markets. I studied hard at a good university and graduated magna cum laude but I just feel stuck like I learned all that for nothing. Not utilizing enough of my skills at work and not getting paid enough and no calls back from jobs. With 60% of my pay going to a small house and food (not to mention medical bills) its tough to get ahead.",

        "content": "For context, I’m a 22M recent grad (graduated May 2025) and am working at a F500 insurance company making ~80,000 as a software engineer. I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).The company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.Yet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?I’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.So I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences.",

More importantly, I don't seem to learn much on the job, it's all pretty repetitive work.I panicked and thought my career growth is gonna be nonexistent, so I started spraying resume to all the new grad positions blindly several months ago, I was able to get 1-2 offers from some other large company, the pay is on-par with my current company, the work seems more interesting to me, and I signed the offers. But now I'm a bit scared when I actually think about job switching. My manager and my colleagues like me, and my manager is promising a promo in 1-2 years (i know this can be bs), seems like most junior engineers get promoted pretty fast. WLB is ok too.I chatted with my friends, and it seems like they are all not getting much learning in their job, and it sounds like dealing with a hot mess is a norm in this industry, doesn't that defeat my original purpose for job switching? Given that there's no significant pay bump in these offers and unknown manager/wlb, should I actually just wait at least until 2/3 yoe to promo/jump to the next level?",

        "content": "In December my manager asked me to quit and that I’d probably be let go by August. I was taken by surprise and didn’t understand why. My new manager was promoted and I was placed under him. My old one is skip manager. I was having lunch with my manager and he laughed when I said I was busy. Eventually in a meeting with him, he snaps at me and tells me to “think!”. I was scared and confused. Keep in mind that I have Autism and severe anxiety. Usually, I get moved to a new project every sprint and have to deliver on time or else. I didn’t really have anyone available to help if I needed them, just a few minutes of explanation on a good day. I was hesitant since I began asking for ADA 6 months prior. I decided to call again and got my ADA approved for 60 days for Autism. I told my manager that I had ASD and would experience memory lapses under enough anxiety. He told me, “you can over come it.” He glanced at the paper explaining my condition and didn’t keep it. 5 days later he puts me on pip and detailing poor code quality. I was shocked. He himself approved those PRs and no one else found issue with it. When I requested pip papers, he gave it to me a month later without the pages of code he showed me. My anxiety skyrocketed to a point where I took extra days off and time to recover from. He never talked to me like the others in the office, and left me out of many team meetings. He puts me on one project where I had to do big data work when my strength was backend. The POC I needed to sign off my work kept changing the solutioning for the data and my ASD brain went into overdrive to make sure I could grasp it. That took 4 weeks. I was struggling with my mental health and updated my mid year a little late. My manager only based my mid year on those 4 weeks only. Shortly after I got very ill and lost a loved one in an accident. My manager told me to compartmentalize. Day 60 into the 90 pip, I ask him for more work since I’ve completed the recent work on time. He told me, “I’m working hard to find you work.” He moved our 1:1 meeting to 4:30. Once I show up to the meeting he said that I showed little improvement and had security escort me out the office. I never saw or heard from HR once. No severance, just out on the street. The ADA expired weeks ago and I was going to reapply once I saw my doctor again. I don’t know what I did wrong. I pushed myself past 100% trying to do as he asked. I compartmentalized and dedicated most of my free time to rest until work the next morning. What did I do wrong? He asked me to quit my black employee resource group, I skipped time with family, and put in an extra few hours on some days to ensure perfect code. I don’t know what I did to disappoint them. My mind would shutdown from exhaustion, but I was on medication to push me past 100%. I’m at home now recovering before I seek my next job. It was my first tech job out of college 2 YOE.",

I have experience as a backend software engineer intern from 2023-24, and for a little over 6 months I've managed to get a part time position at a crappy small networking company that pays a measly $16 an hour, but it's at least good experience to put on a resume, and it's close to my house at least. I completely dropped applying for jobs ever since I got this current position because it genuinely just made me depressed every day, but with full time right around the corner and finding out full time genuinely is just worse in this pay with barely any pay bumps, I want to start looking for better software engineering positions out there. So here's my question: how do I start again? Here's where I am at right now. I already rebuilt my resume, updated my LinkedIn and GitHub to match my current experience, and I have a personal website I already included on my resume and attach on any application. My previous internship had be working on Backend JavaScript most of the time, and my current place utilizes php, python, and CRM development whenever I'm doing programming stuff. I really prefer C# and JavaScript. Admittedly I have not worked on a personal project in a long time, but I intend to work on some C# related projects soon. Where should I be looking for positions? Is it still LinkedIn, or is there a better option? Are there any programming languages that are high in demand right now that I should focus on instead? Should I use a different version of my resume each time I apply for anywhere? I've been out of the game for a while, and I know it's only gotten worse. I'm wondering what my next step should be now that I at least have something worth a damn to put on a resume, or if I should just abandon ship and use my experience for something adjacent.

But the last few months have been chaos. Management’s scrambling, people are quitting or quietly transferring, and entire projects are collapsing faster than they can be reassigned.Half the people I used to rely on have left, and now I’m basically maintaining random fragments of systems that no one else touches. There’s no mentorship, no technical challenge, and definitely no direction. Every day feels like “keep the lights on” mode.The thing is — I’m not overworked. I’m **understimulated.** The job’s too easy, the pay’s on the low side, and the feeling of stagnation is eating me alive. I used to love coding — building stuff, solving problems, learning new tech — now I just click through Jira tickets and slowly detach a bit more each week.I’ve thought about quitting a hundred times. I’ve even enrolled in a part-time Master’s starting next year as a soft reset — not because I need the degree, but because I need structure and a sense of progress again.But with Christmas coming up and everything slowing down, part of me thinks, *“just coast through the holidays, collect the chill paycheck, maybe even get a promo before you dip.”*Then another part of me goes, *“why am I still trying to climb a ladder I don’t even want to be on?”*I know a lot of people here are probably going through their own flavor of career existentialism — either can’t find the perfect job, can’t get one at all, or are stuck in something that’s fine on paper but quietly soul-draining. I just want to hear from anyone who’s in this same weird spot.How did you break out of the comfort trap early in your career? Did you quit cold, coast strategically, go back to study, or just wait until the burnout made the choice for you?",

        "content": "Interviewing with a company, the job posting made it sound like I'd be working heavily on C# ASP.NET APIs, writing Rest APIs, and doing normal software stuff like my last job.After interviewing with the hiring manager, he mentioned that it's actually more focused on working with Power Apps (which I do not know or have experience with) but they said my experience as a SWE should be sufficient to get me up to speed with that part of the job. The company itself is not a tech company, but in an entirely different industry/sector. Their tech team is small, and apparently a majority of the time I would be working on would be these Power Apps.Is this something if I take on, and do for years, would this look bad on my resume? Is this some disparate technology with little overlap to actual SWE work and SWE career growth? Would you take this kind of work for a company which is not tech focused? Moreover, would you move across the country to accept a job like this? I want to feel confident that I won't regret making a large life and career decision based on something that wasn't what I was looking for. I feel like they used normal SWE keywords and kind of bait and switched the role, as the focus will be heavily on these low code platforms which I don't have much experience with.",

        "content": "Good day devs! I’ve been working as a junior software dev (2 YOE) for a couple months now. It’s just me and my boss. He’s an ex-Reddit engineer with ~15 years of experience, and I come from a web background.We’re building a pretty big multi-app Flutter + Firebase project using Clean Architecture, which is all new to me. The main struggle I’m having is that I rarely get clear requirements. Usually I’ll get something like:“We need a chat box that can also record audio.”And that’s it. From there, I’m expected to figure out everything — UX, architecture, edge cases, and make it up to his standards.He doesn’t really walk me through the context or help clarify requirements; I usually just get feedback once I open my first PR. My PRs almost never meet expectations on the first few goes, and sometimes I make rookie mistakes (like forgetting to rebase), which makes me feel even worse. His feedback can be pretty blunt, too.Because I’m still learning Flutter, Firebase, and the project structure, things take me a long time — sometimes weeks for a single feature. Even when I do understand the requirements, like for the Auth flow I’m finishing now, it’s still slow progress.I’m trying hard to improve, but it’s been rough. During my interview, I said I perform above the average junior — and he’s holding me to that, which is fair. But right now I feel like I’m constantly falling short, and I can’t tell if that’s because I’m actually underperforming… or because this setup would be tough for anyone at my level.So I guess my question is:Is this kind of setup (basically no guidance, just tasks and expectations) normal for a junior? am I genuinely underperforming? And if you’ve been in a similar spot, what helped you get through it?TLDR:I’m a 2 YOE junior dev working under a super-senior ex-Reddit engineer. I get very vague task descriptions (e.g. “build a chat box that records audio”) and have to figure everything out myself — UX, architecture, edge cases, etc. I’m learning a new stack (Flutter + Firebase + Clean Arch), so progress is slow and feedback is tough. Not sure if I’m actually underperforming or if this setup is just rough for a junior. Looking for advice or perspective.",

They told me everything is covered from rental to flight to hotel.I am in the middle of booking everything now and should I be worried about spending too much? Right now I'm at like $250 for flight, $126 a night for hotel, and then like $200-$300 for rental. They also said meals would be covered by idk how. I know I don't owe the company but I'm not the only one they're flying out so I also don't want to ruin my chances if I overdo it and I'm seen as too much of a hassle to have come in.Also any tips for things like these? I will be spending an evening with them so are there specific things I should watch out for or remember? Update: Thanks everyone for the help! The best advice was just asking them because I found out that the admin person organizing everything screwed up some details. The only thing I'm even responsible for is flight and apparently they take care of everything else. I should have just asked first but I got nervous trying to get everything in order because my original date for the interview was pushed up sooner. But it's all good now and I feel much more relaxed lol They are taking care of everything",

Sometimes I feel embarrassed seeing my classmates move ahead while I feel like I can’t keep up.I enjoy programming and creating things, but lately it’s been hard to maintain the pace. I’m receiving psychological and psychiatric treatment, but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. I just feel exhausted.If I continue in my current program, it would probably take me about 2.5 more years if everything goes perfectly, which honestly seems unlikely.If I switch universities, I would likely have to start almost from scratch (3.5 more years).And if I quit completely, I’m afraid of being directionless and feeling even more stuck.What worries me the most is the future:I want to work in technology, grow into leadership or managerial roles, and eventually emigrate. But I don’t know if I absolutely need a university degree for that, or if I could build that path through technical certifications and work experience. However, I have this thought that without a degree I won’t be “anyone.”In summary:•I feel emotionally drained and frustrated.•I don’t want to keep spending money if I’m not making progress.•I also don’t want to give up without thinking it through; I’ve already made too many bad decisions.Has anyone been through something similar?Is it worth continuing the university route, or is it better to try something else?Any honest opinions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.Thanks for reading.",

Some context: at Amazon I’m on an important team, starting to think about promotion, but manager recently moved so that’s been delayed and harder without him. Probably 6-12 months to L5 (what my L6 said) and salary goes up around 20%. Working 10-6, sometimes 7. Pretty chill wlb and good team. Not many perks. Lots of responsibilities and big projects with large impact.I definitely have a short term life goal of moving away from London for a few years while I am young. in a year after my promo I can move to the US on L1 visa, idk how feasible it is to get a good transfer internationally tho.Got an offer from a pretty big startup, it’s remote first but has offices in a few places, spoke to some engineers and they are working 9-7 so about 2 more per day. Salary around 30% more than Zon, take home post tax is 5.1k, vs 4k atm. Even after promo I’ll be only be on about 4.5k. It’s an exciting AI company, very interesting fast paced work.So here’s the decision-making part… I’d make more, moving now, than I would even after a promo here. At the startup, we would report to a tech lead who reports to the CTO; it’s fast-paced and high ownership (so is Amazon, tbf). I think I’ll have a lot of responsibilities, not treated like an L4, and I think it will supercharge my growth.My main concerns: is being a digital nomad at 22 weird? Idk how I feel about it for career growth, but I love travelling, so I’d be excited! But I might be more excited about the USA move (even though it’s two years away, I’d be 24). I’m not sure how easy it is, and I’m not sure if I’d have the same opportunity to move if I was in the startup.What would you guys do? Idk. Anything I’m not considering? The way I’m thinking about is - I’m 22, most of my peers are still unemployed and I am in a very fortunate position. Unsure if I’m rushing into a job switch too fast.",

Not many people want to move or return to office.TLDR: Senior level skills, didn’t get official title before company restructure. Asking for advice and tips before 2 senior role interviews today.",

Only reason I can live is because I live with my girlfriend and two incomes help. I also freelance video editing on the side to earn am extra £200 a month. I heard from cco after discussing how raises and promotions work is that something is being discussed for me which would not take into effect until January which is when the annual review occurs but im not sure I trust them to get a livable wage after. (Which I would want at minimum 30k, I dont think thats a bold ask, they pay their higher levels alot of money)I feel the work I do is not reflected in my pay by any means also considering 80% of mew grads with 0 yoe can earn 30k. Im debating if I should have a chat with my manager, its a small company and I do love the work I do there, shit pay doesnt really make me want to do any work....",

        "content": "Background: I have a little over 1 YOE, working at a defense company since I graduated college. I live in an MCOL area, and my base pay is \\~90K. I am expecting a promotion soon (from L1 to L2) which I believe will get me to 110-130K. I am in person full time because my work requires a clearance, which is kind of sucky (I would prefer a hybrid/remote role).I want to leave my role for a few reasons:* Salary increase* Potentially switch to another company with more prestige* Remote/hybrid opportunities* The tech stack I'm working with is fairly modern, but I do feel like the project suffers from poor software engineering practices. It lacks structure, has inconsistent code quality, minimal error handling, and an unresponsive, buggy UI. It feels like it was built without clear architecture or professional standards. The codebase is massive, so theres only so much I can do about this.The problem is that although I want to leave, the current state of the market is really rough and I am considering staying due to the job stability that I have. I am wondering if I should just stick it out with my current company for several more years and get a master's degree while I work full time, which the company will pay for in its entirety. At my company, getting a master's degree leads to a promotion quicker from L2 to L3, and I am thinking if I get a master's degree, especially in the AI/ML space, it will help me in the future when it comes to my career and opening up more jobs. However, doing this will keep me stuck at the company for several years and I won't be able to leave until 1 year after I have obtained the degree. Given the current state of the market, is it a better idea to stick it out with my company and get a master's degree, or stay screw it and apply to other companies?",

        "content": "Ok so I am currently a senior in High-school right now, but next fall I am going to be enrolled in college. I already have 1.5 years of college done (my basics) so that will give me more time to focus on what I actually want to pursue as a career. Ever since middle school, I have decided I wanted to pursue computer science and since the ending of last year, I have decided I want to major in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and minor in cybersecurity. However, anytime I tell someone I want to major in computer science I get negative comments such as “that’s unemployment “ or “AI is going to take over that field” and that is just making me overthink and second guess what I want to do. I feel like majority of those people simply don’t know exactly what computer science is though and they have no idea what they are talking about but it still has me concerned. So my question to everyone on here is (if you are taking comp sci right now or particularly those who already have a career in the field) should I still pursue this field? Is it worth it? What exactly do you do? Do I have anything to worry about?",
