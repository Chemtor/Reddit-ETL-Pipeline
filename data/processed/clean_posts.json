        "content": "Hey all, I just finished my Amazon Data Engineer Inter view loop recently (and got the offer ). Since I noticed a lot of outdated info online, thought I’d share how the process looked for me and what concepts are worth preparing. Hopefully this helps someone grinding through prep.**Process Overview** **Recruiter Screen (30 min)** Role fit + background discussion. One or two simple SQL/Python checks.**Technical Phone Screens (75 min each)** Mostly SQL and Python/ETL. Not just solving, but also follow-ups on query optimization and edge cases. Each screen also tested one Leadership Principle (LP) (mine were Dive Deep and Deliver Results).**Onsite / Virtual Loop (3–5 rounds, 60 min each)** SQL Deep Dive → joins, windows, Top-K, rolling averages. Coding / ETL Design → handling messy/late data, retries, streaming vs batch. Data Modeling → fact/dim schema, partitions, SCDs, trade-offs in Redshift/S3/Spark. Manager + Bar Raiser → critical rounds. Heavy mix of technical judgment + LPs. These carry a lot of weight in the final decision.LPs are central across all rounds. Prep STAR stories for Dive Deep, Deliver Results, Insist on Highest Standards, Are Right A Lot, Customer Obsession.**Concepts / Questions to Prepare** **SQL** Window functions (ROW\\_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD). Complex joins, CTEs, subqueries. Aggregations + grouping, rolling averages, time-based calcs. Growth/churn queries (YoY, MoM).**Python / ETL** Flattening nested JSON/lists. Real-time sliding window averages. Deduplication by key + timestamp. Batch pipeline design with late data handling.**Data Modeling** Orders/transactions schema with fact/dim and SCD for Prime status. Clickstream/session schema with partitions. Star vs snowflake schema, warehouse trade-offs.**Leadership Principles (LPs)** Dive Deep: Debugging a broken pipeline under pressure. Deliver Results: Handling a P0 deadline. Highest Standards: Raising quality standards despite deadlines. Invent & Simplify: Automating repetitive workflows.**My Takeaways** Amazon DE evaluations are 50% technical and 50% LPs. SQL/Python prep is not enough — LP storytelling is equally important. Manager + Bar Raiser rounds are the toughest and usually decide the outcome.That’s my experience. If you’re preparing, don’t underestimate the LP side of it — it’s just as important as SQL/Python.

It's actually something I recently started because most of my experience was in Scala.But I've had to use Pandas sporadically in the past 5 years and recently at my current company some of the engineers/DS have been selecting Pandas for some projects/quick scriptsAnd I just hate it, tbh. I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.Performance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.Usage-Wise, this is where I hate it.It's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. Pandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.Today I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.It just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.I know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering I recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ called flash\\_hash\\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up to **2x faster** than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\\_hash\\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)This post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-PartitionedThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.The industry-standard approach is the **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a \"divide and conquer\" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.However, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designed **Unpartitioned** concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.The reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.I implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings: **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for SpeedWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing** This is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS** To allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution is **Shard Locking** (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash: lock\\_array\\[hash(key) % 2048\\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator** The build-side hash table in a join has a critical property: **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: the **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly free—just a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminates malloc overhead and memory fragmentation.**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array** A potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallel tag array of uint8\\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in the tag array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byte tag. Only if the tag matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching** The probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I use **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to \"tell\" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process key i in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that key i+N (where N is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access: \\_mm\\_prefetch((void\\*)&table\\[hash(keys\\[i+N\\])\\], \\_MM\\_HINT\\_T0); While the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to key i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing** Instead of a generic library like xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions: uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) { uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB; uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key); return crc * ((k << 32) + 1); }The \\_mm\\_crc32\\_u32 is an **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse than xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't WorkNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few \"great\" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensive **Gather** operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win in **low-hit-rate** scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overhead—every key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the \"grouping\" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.# ConclusionThe performance of flash\\_hash\\_join doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.* **Details**: Squeezing performance with tag arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.Most importantly, this entire process was **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out \"optimizations\" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.I hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.Note: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\\_efficient\\_hash\\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",

        "content": "I'm working at a company that has relatively simple data ingest needs - delimited CSV or similar lands in S3. Orchestration is currently Airflow and the general pattern is S3 sftp bucket -> copy to client infra paths -> parse + light preprocessing -> data-lake parquet write -> write to PG tables as the initial load step.The company has an unfortunate history of \"not-invented-here\" syndrome. They have a historical data ingest tool that was designed for database to database change capture with other things bolted on. It's not a good fit for the current main product. They have *another* internal python tool that a previous dev wrote to do the same thing (S3 CSV or flat file etc -> write to PG db). Then that dev left. Now the architect wrote a new open-source tool (up on github at least) during some sabbatical time that he wants to start using. No one on the team really understands the two existing tools and this just feels like more not-invented-here tech debt. What's a good go tool that is well used, well documented, and has a good support community? Future state will be moving to databricks, thought likely keeping the data in internal PG DBs.I've used NIFI before at previous companies but that feels like overkill for what we're doing. What do people suggest?",

        "content": "I've been doing data things for awhile now, full-time for \\~6 years since graduating, as a full data engineer for \\`4 years. It seems every job I reach a point every year or two where motivation drops and I just don't care anymore. Performance begins to drop. When the going gets real hard I go get another job, I have climbed up to a senior role now. Fortunately this employment history of two years per organization seems to be acceptable.Problem is I am here again. Have been interviewing for roles and trying to get excited again about new projects. Interviewing for some lead roles and already have an offer to lead migration from DBT to a streaming setup. But I wonder if I'm setting myself up for failure. I do enjoy technical challenges but I do sort of feel like I am only using one side of my brain as a data engineer.Am I just burnt out and maybe need a break? I feel like even with a break the same thing would eventually come back. I don't currently have a stressful job, for example I work about 30 hours a week maybe I need to find value from other parts of life.I am also looking at going back to school for a master's to pick up some skills that would allow me to maybe work on more interesting projects (don't have the CS or engineering undergrad background, would maybe be cool to explore other technical subjects) Not thinking I'd suddenly become a game developer but I love to tinker and maybe having more fundamentals would allow me to get a personal project off the ground to the point where that could be a full-time job. I would love to have more product-focused SWE skills versus just being able to migrate DBT models to Databricks. But the downside is becoming a poor student again when I already have a career, maybe just not the one I want.Anyone who has done DE type work for longer able to comment? Are these types of low points normal, or a hint I should try to continue to find something else?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, Wanted to share an approach we've standardized for managing our data stacks that has saved us from a ton of headaches: treating the data warehouse itself as a version-controlled, automated piece of infrastructure, just like any other application. The default for many teams is still to manage things like roles, permissions, and warehouses by clicking around in the Snowflake/BigQuery UI. It's fast for a one-off change, but it's a recipe for disaster. It's not auditable, not easily repeatable across environments, and becomes a huge mess as the team grows.We adopted a strict Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model for this using Terraform. I wrote a blog post that breaks down our exact blueprint. If you're still managing your DWH by hand or looking for a more structured way to do it, the post might give you some useful ideas.Full article here: [https://blueprintdata.xyz/blog/modern-data-stack-iac-with-terraform](https://blueprintdata.xyz/blog/modern-data-stack-iac-with-terraform) Curious to hear how other teams are handling this. Are you all-in on IaC for your warehouse? Any horror stories from the days of manual UI clicks?",

        "author": "Then_Difficulty_5617",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on optimizing joins between two very large tables (hundreds of millions of records each) in a data lake environment. I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.Based on my research, here’s a quick summary of my understanding:* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. It’s more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.My main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.Given this, I have a few questions for the community:1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?I'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation. Any advice or examples you can share would be a huge help! Thanks in advance.",

I know airflow is the standard around here, but it also seems very much overkill for small teams with small needs.Is it because it's YAML or something else that I'm missing? I know the price for the enterprise edition is steep (I was quoted 50k Euros a year to start).From what I've experienced so far in my tests, it's an easy setup in Docker (not too many dependencies) and has a user to protect the web UI (in the free version).Prefect is also an easy setup (even works as a direct install on Windows...), but it seems to lack users on the FOSS version (might need to set up a reverse proxy). Does anyone who uses it or has used it have some pros/cons about it vs something modern as well like Prefect?",

My goal is to keep things cohesive and easy to manage, especially for changes like adding a new column (e.g., last\\_name to a client table).Current setup:* DAGs: Stored in a Git repo (Azure DevOps) and synced to Airflow.* PySpark notebooks: Stored in Databricks Workspace, synced to Git via Databricks Repos.* Configs: Stored in Delta Lake tables in Databricks.This feels a bit fragmented since I'm managing code in two environments (Git for DAGs, Databricks for notebooks). For example, adding a new column requires updating a notebook in Databricks and sometimes a DAG in Git.How should I organize these Python files for a streamlined workflow? Should I keep both DAGs and notebooks in a single Git repo for consistency? Or is there a better approach (e.g., DBFS, Azure Blob Storage)? Any advice on managing changes across both file types would be super helpful. Thanks for your insights!",

        "content": "Please judge/critique this approach to data quality in a SQL DWH (and provide avenues to improve, if possible). What I did is fairly common sense, I am interested in what are other \"architectural\" or \"data engineering\" approaches, methods, tools to solve this problem and how could I improve this?1. Data from some core systems (ERP, PDM, CRM, ...)2. Data gets ingested to SQL Database through Azure Data Factory.3. Several schemas in dwh for governance (original tables (IT) -> translated (IT) -> Views (Business))4. What I then did is to create master data views for each business object (customers, parts, suppliers, employees, bills of materials, ...)5. I have around 20 scalar-valued functions that return \"Empty\", \"Valid\", \"InvalidPlaceholder\", \"InvalidFormat\", among others when being called with an Input (e.g. a website, mail, name, IBAN, BIC, taxnumbers, and some internal logic). At the end of the post, there is an example of one of these functions.6. Each master data view with some data object to evaluate calls one or more of these functions and writes the result in a new column on the view itself (e.g. \"dq\\_validity\\_website\").7. These views get loaded into PowerBI for data owners that can check on the quality of their data.8.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello folks, I'm a data engineer at a tech company in Norway. We have terabytes of operational data, coming mostly from IoT devices (all internal, nothing 3rd-party dependent). Analytics and Operational departments consume this data which is - mostly - stored in Postgres and MySQL databases in AWS. Tale as old as time: what served really well for the past years, now is starting to slow down (queries that timeout, band-aid solutions made by the developer team to speed up queries, complex management of resources in AWS, etc). Given that the company is doing quite well and we are expanding our client base a lot, there's a need to have a more modern (or at least better-performant) architecture to serve our data needs. Since no one was really familiar with modern data platforms, they hired only me (I'll be responsible for devising our modernization strategy and mapping the needed skillset for further hires - which I hope happens soon :D ) My strategy is to pick one (or a few) use cases and showcase the value that having our data in Snowflake would bring to the company. Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy). My current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)My comments / questions are \\- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS? \\- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified) \\- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS? \\- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?) Any insights or comments from similar experiences are welcomed :)",

I'd prefer it to be general purpose solution for everything (and ditch current setup completely) but also I'd accept it to be a solution only for critical data/calculations.The solution should be on-premise and allow Spark computations.How to build such a thing? We are currently thinking about Apache Ozone for storage (one baremetal cluster stretched to 3 datacenters, replication factor of 3, rack-aware setup) and 2-3 kubernetes (one for each datacenter) for Spark computations. But I am afraid our cross-datacenter network will be bottleneck. One idea to mitigate that is to force kubernetes Spark to read from Ozone nodes from its own datacenter and reach other dc only when there is no available replica in the datacenter (I have not found a way to do that in Ozone docs).What would you do?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I wanted to get some feedback from people who work with databases and data pipelines regularly.# The ProblemIn a lot of real-world projects (especially data migrations, warehouse integrations, or working with client-provided dumps), I often receive a set of **database tables with only column names and maybe some sample data — but no ERD, no constraints, no documentation**.For example:* I might get 50–100 tables dumped from SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.* Columns have names like `cust_id`, `c_id`, `customerID`, `fk_cust` spread across tables.* Foreign key constraints are either missing or never set up.* Sometimes I also get a CSV or JSON with sample data, but that’s it.Manually figuring out how these tables connect is time-consuming:* Which `id` in one table maps to which column in another?* Which columns are just lookups vs. actual relationships?* Which ones are “fake” similarities (like `code` columns that don’t really connect)?I end up doing a mix of manual joins, searching for overlapping values, and asking business users — but it’s not scalable.# My Approach (experimental)1. **Column Name Matching:** Use fuzzy string matching (manually) to catch things like `cust_id` ≈ `customerID`.2. **Data Overlap:** Sample distinct values from columns and see if they overlap (e.g., 70% of values in one column appear in another).3. **Weighted Confidence:** Combine name similarity + overlap + datatype compatibility into a score (e.g., strong match if name & overlap both high).4. **Visualization:** generate a graph view (like a partial ERD) that shows “probable” relationships.It’s not 100% accurate, but in testing I can get \\~60–70% of relationships guessed correctly, which is a good starting point before manual validation.# My Question to You* How do *you* usually solve this problem today when no documentation or foreign keys exist?* Do you rely on scripts, BI tools, schema crawlers, or just manual detective work?* If you had such a tool, what features would make it actually useful in your day-to-day (e.g., synonym dictionaries, CSV upload, integration with ERD tools, etc.)?* Do you see this as a real pain point, or just an occasional annoyance not worth automating?I’d really appreciate your insights :folded_hands: — even if your answer is “we don’t face this problem often.”",

Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.**Why did I even bother writing this?**I found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldn’t find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, I’ve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.**Platforms****nexos.ai**Quick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.*Pros** I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.* Cost alert messages, so we don’t blow our budget in a week.* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.* It has an API gateway.*Cons** They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.**Langfuse**Quick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.*Pros** Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.* The A/B testing feature is awesome.*Cons** It’s open-source, so we’ll see how it goes.**Portkey**Quick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI*Pros** Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.* Robust logging features.* Dev-centric UI.*Cons** Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.**Arize Phoenix**Quick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.*Pros** Slack alerts are super convenient.* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.*Cons** Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.**Overall**I feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai. It’s just all there available out of the box, with the observability, management, and guardrails menu providing the exact feature set we were looking for. Close second for me is Langfuse due to its open-source nature and good documentation coverage.",

I searched this sub and saw a lot of roadmaps and information. I saw a lot of you are changed career paths or switched to DE after some experience. Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insights.I saw this [course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/),is this a good starting point? Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level? I looked through a lot of entry-level job description and it expect other skills and concepts aswell(i dunno if thats included in this course in other terms or in between).I know there is no single best course. I hope to know what your take on this course and your other suggestions. I also looked the zoomacamp one but it seems to start at January. I have pretty solid understanding and experiance in python and sql and as worked on ml, know how to clean, manipulate and visualize data. What path should i take forward? Please guide me, Your valuable insights and information s are much appreciated. Thank in advance :red_heart:.",

I like it but definitely don't love it / have a passion for it.At this point, I'm heavily considering pivoting into sales of some sort, ideally software. I have good social skills and outgoing personality and people have always told me I'd be good at it. I know Software Sales is a lot less stable, major lay-offs happen from missing 1 month's quota, first couple years I'll be making \\~$80k-$90k and is definitely more of a grind. But in order to excel in Data Science/Engineering I'm going to have to become a math/tech geek, get a masters and dedicate years to learning algorithms/models/technologies and coding languages. It doesn't seem to play to my strengths and kind of lacks excitement and energy imo.1. Do you see any opportunities for those with data analytics to break into a good sales role/company without sales experience?2. Data Science salary seems to top out around $400k, and thats rather far along in a career at top tech firm (I know FAANG pays much more). While, Sales you can be making $200K in 4 years if you are top. Does comp continuously progress from there?3. Has anyone made a similar jump and regretted it?Any words of wisdom or guiding advice would be appreciated.",

I’ve tried v1 and v2 charts, they’re both not working. V2 chart is the worst, the helm template throws an error of an ingressClass config missing at the root of the values file, but the official helm chart doesn’t show an ingressClass config file there.

Do you think it’s more viable to double down on one platform like Databricks (even though I have more experience than expertise) and target larger orgs? - I feel most of freelance DE are doing the latest right now...Appreciate any perspective!

Other people in my team do not have almost any data engineering expertise and limited software engineering experience.We have a bunch of simple Python ETL scripts, getting data from various sources to our database. Now they are running on crontab on a remote server. Now I suggested implementing some CI/CD practices around our codebase, including creating a CI/CD pipeline for code testng and stuff. And my teammates are now suggesting that we should run our actual Python code inside those pipelines as well.I think that this is a terrible idea due to numerous reasons, but I'm also not experienced enough to be 100% confident. So that's why I'm reaching out to you - is there something that I'm missing? Maybe it's OK to execute them in ADO Pipeline?(I know that optimally this should be run somewhere else, like a K8s cluster, but let's say that we don't have access to those resources - that's why I'm opting with just staying in crontab).",

I’m fine keeping a local DuckDB “warehouse” and pushing to MD at the end.**What I’ve built so far*** **Python + lxml** extractors (minimal XPath, mostly `.find`/`.findtext`\\-style).* **Bucketing**: * I split the file list into buckets (e.g., 1k–10k XMLs per bucket). * Each bucket runs in its **own process** and writes to its **own local DuckDB** file. * Inside a bucket, I use a **ThreadPool** to parse XMLs concurrently and **batch insert** every N files.* **Merge step**: * After buckets finish, I **merge** all bucket DBs into a fresh, timestamped **final DuckDB**. * (When I want MD, I `ATTACH` MotherDuck and do one `INSERT … SELECT` per table.)* **Fault tolerance**: * Per-run, per-bucket outputs (separate files) let me **re-run only failed buckets** without redoing everything. * I keep per-run staging dirs and a clean final DB name to avoid merging with stale data.**Current performance (local)*** On a small test: **100 XMLs** → \\~**0.46s/file** end-to-end on Windows (NVMe SSD), total \\~**49s** including merge.* When I pushed per-batch directly to MotherDuck earlier, it was **way slower** (network/commit overhead), hence the current **local-first, single push** design.**Constraints/notes*** Data is static on disk; I can pre-generate a file manifest and shard however I want.* I can increase hardware parallelism, but I’d prefer to squeeze the most out of a single beefy box before renting cluster time.* I’m fine changing the staging format (DuckDB :left-right_arrow: Parquet) if it meaningfully improves merge/push speed or reliability.If you’ve built similar pipelines (XML/JSON → analytics DB) I’d love to hear what worked, what didn’t, and any “wish I knew sooner” tips.

        "content": "Hi everyone,I want to share a project I have been working on. It is a **retail data pipeline** using **Airflow**, **MinIO**, **MySQL and Metabase**. The goal is to process retail sales data (invoices, customers, products) and make it ready for analysis.Here is what the project does:* **ETL and analysis:** Extract, transform, and analyze retail data using **pandas**. We also perform **data quality checks** in MySQL to ensure the data is clean and correct.* **Pipeline orchestration:** Airflow runs DAGs to automate the workflow.* **XCom storage:** Large pandas DataFrames are stored in **MinIO**. Airflow only keeps references, which makes it easier to pass data between tasks.* **Database:** MySQL stores metadata and results. It can run init scripts automatically to create tables or seed data.* **Metabase :** Used for simple visualization.You can check the full project on GitHub: [https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/](https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/) [https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow](https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow)I built this project to explore Airflow, using object storage for XCom, and building ETL pipelines for retail data.If you are new to this field like me, I would be happy to work together and share experience while building projects.I would also like to hear your thoughts.

Is it declineThe reason I’m asking is because the latest information I’ve found on the forum was updated two years ago. Back then, Spark was still the mainstream, and I’ve also seen Beam’s adoption rate in the industry declining. Even GCP BigQuery now supports Spark, so learning GCP Dataflow at my internship feels like a skill I might not be able to carry forward. Should I switch to learning Spark instead?Thanks in advance.[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1nh91cc)",

It looks like a cheap company and it seems I will never get a raise there as my colleagues also say (some are here for 5+ years).I get the market is cheat, company already fired most of people and changing jobs is not easy... Job hoping does not seem like an option. I've been trying for a year and a half now besides all my background. I managed to get more than 20 interviews, but they all seem to be ghost vacancies because some are active even after a year. I started to ghost interviews and recruiters past two weeks because I can't handle shitty processes anymore with 20+ hours of dedication.I am not the kind of person that just ask for money. This year I did 3 major projects that impacted the company: saved 20% of cloud costs (\\~30k per year saved). Create a new module ML related that increased our+partners margins from 2 to 8% (\\~ 50k year with the potential to get 3x more). Finally refactored some code that removed hidden costs/flaws in a system that relies on data and was supposed to charge partners for everything (more \\~25k). Most of those are not even 100% DE related projects. I did the same steps to reach a good quality of work in the past 3 companies regarding the DE problems. It seems to me that most of companies don't need a ultra stack to run and don't even Big Data problems to solve. So just one orchestrator with good data validation, modeling and observability are good enough to keep everyone sleeping well at night. What I mean is that DE doesn't look like a challenge anymore so that's why I've been pivoting to more ML/Finance/backend/infra related projects.I did all these projects because I wanted, nobody asked or have the guts to push for them. I don't wanna look like the hero here, I did because I enjoy my work and also because I believe this is the way to get a raise oc. Also other developers/DEs (thanks to all autonomy we have) seems to be in the over engineering hell or dealing with minor fire fights (not deliveryng value at all).So I have numbers and impact but now (since beginning of the year) is not a good time for a raise they say. But what also worries me is that:Everyone seems to be hanging and doing nothing. No projects, no follow ups (or shitty ones/same ones for 6 months), nobody in the office as much as they are suposed to be (3x week). There's no ownership at all even from the managers. I start to wonder that even managers are working o side projects now because of their lack of presence. Is this a cultural thing here in NL? Or a moment in IT field? Or what else? Everyone seems to be pissed and without purpouse nowadays or just doing less than the basics.How could I better navigate through this? Help me with your thoughts please.",

        "content": "I'm interested in making a pivot to data engineering. Like the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kp2puy/am_i_too_old/), I'm in my 60s and plan to work until I'm 75 or so. Unlike that person, I have a background in technical support, IT services, and data processing. From 2007 to 2018, I worked as a data operator for a company that does data processing for financial services and health benefits businesses. I taught myself Python, Ruby, and PowerShell and used them to troubleshoot and repair problems with the data processing pipelines. From 2018 to 2023, I did email and chat tech support for Google Maps Platform APIs. Like literally millions of other people, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate course and started researching data careers. I think that I would prefer data engineering over data science or data analytics, but from my research, I concluded that I would need a master's degree to get into data engineering, while it would be possible to get a data analytics job with a community college degree and a good data portfolio.In 2023, I started taking classes for a computer information technology associate's degree at my local community college. Earlier this year, though, I discovered online university WGU (Western Governors University) has bachelor's and master's degrees in data analytics. The bachelor's degree has a much better focus on data analytics than my community college degrees. The WGU data analytics [master's degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html) (MSDA) has a specialization in data engineering, which reawakened my interest in the field. I've been preparing to start at WGU to earn the [bachelor's in data analytics](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-bachelors-program.html) (BSDA), then enroll in the master's degree with data engineering specialization. Last month, WGU rolled out four degree programs in [Cloud and Network Engineering](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-network-engineering-bachelors-program.html) (General, AWS, Azure, and Cisco specializations). Since then, I've been trying to decide if I would be better off earning one of those degrees (instead of the BSDA) to prepare for the MSDA.Some of the courses in the **BS in Data Analytics (BSDA)**:* Data Management (using SQL) (3 courses)* Python programming (3 courses), R programming (1 course)* Data Wrangling* Data Visualization* Big Data Foundations* Cloud Foundations* Machine Learning, Machine Learning DevOps (1 course each)* Network and Security - Foundations (only 1 course)Some of the courses in the **BS in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure Specialization) (BSCNE)**:* Network and Security - Foundations (same course as above)* Networks (CompTIA Network+)* Network and Security Applications (CompTIA Security+)* Network Analytics and Troubleshooting* Python for IT Automation* AI for IT Automation and Security* Cloud Platform Solutions* Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Orchestration* Cloud and Network Security ModelsBesides Network+ and Security+, I would earn CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions certifications in the BSCNE degree. The BSDA degree would give me AWS Cloud Practitioner and a couple of other certifications.If you've gotten this far - thank you! Thank you very much! Also, I have questions:1. Would the master's in Data Analytics (Data Engineering specialization) from **WGU** be worth it for a data engineering job seeker?2. If so, which WGU bachelor's degree would be better preparation for the data engineering MSDA and a later data engineering role - the bachelor's in Data Analysis, or the bachelor's in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure or AWS)?",

        "author": "YouFar3426",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m excited to share my latest project: **PyRMap**, a lightweight R-Python bridge designed to make data exchange between R and Python faster and cleaner.*What it does:*PyRMap allows R to pass data to Python via memory-mapped files (mmap) for near-zero overhead communication. The workflow is simple:1. R writes the data to a memory-mapped binary file.2. Python reads the data and processes it (even running models).3. Results are written back to another memory-mapped file, instantly accessible by R.*Key advantages over reticulate:** :high_voltage: Performance: As shown in my benchmark, for \\~1.5 GB of data, PyRMap is significantly faster than reticulate – reducing data transfer times by 40%* :broom: Clean & maintainable code: Data is passed via shared memory, making the R and Python code more organized and decoupled (check example 8 from here - [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example\\_8\\_reticulate\\_comparation](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example_8_reticulate_comparation)). Python runs as a separate process, avoiding some of the overhead reticulate introduces.https://preview.redd.it/mhcpmljn1bof1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b557ef319ddb8f5ae0d2f3ea2647eb1f69bfe1Current limitations:* Linux-only* Only supports running the entire Python script, not individual function calls.* Intermediate results in pipelines are not yet accessible.PyRMap is also part of a bigger vision: RR, a custom R interpreter written in RPython, which I hope to launch next year.Check it out here: [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap)Would you use a tool like this?",

But I’m not satisfied just coasting by and not immediately understanding what these developers are talking about once they get really deep in the weeds. 1 question I have is, my project apparently needs to use something called Informatica-QA but apparently a different project needs its server to load files for some other project. And that’s why we can’t use it to proceed with QA testing.Can I understand what is informatica-QA, the concept of its connection to a server, and why we can’t use it? B/c then how do other hundreds of projects survive if they can’t use it either? Is everyone blocked now for whatever reason?I apologize if my question is just too dumb. :(",

        "content": "Hey folks,I’ve been working on something I call **SevenDB**, and I thought I’d share it here to get feedback, criticism, or even just wild questions.SevenDB is my experimental take on a database. The motivation comes from a mix of frustration with existing systems and curiosity: Traditional databases excel at storing and querying, but they treat reactivity as an afterthought. Systems bolt on triggers, changefeeds, or pub/sub layers — often at the cost of correctness, scalability, or painful race conditions.SevenDB takes a different path: reactivity is core. We extend the excellent work of DiceDB with new primitives that make subscriptions as fundamental as inserts and updates.[https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB)I'd love for you guys to have a look at this , design plan is included in the repo , mathematical proofs for determinism and correctness are in progress , would add them soon .it is far from achieved , i have just made a foundational deterministic harness and made subscriptions fundamental , but the distributed part is still in progress , i am into this full-time , so expect rapid development and iterations",

The Rules:We are given a problem to solve 10 - 20 min, the first team to finish gets the max grade, the second team gets one unit less, the third team another unit less and so on, if you don't finish in time you get 0. Here's the problem: I feel I have a solid foundation in python and sockets, but is not enough when everyone else is just using AI( Ctrl c + Ctrl v). As long as the code runs you get the grade. Meanwhile I try to understand things deeply and write my own solutions, but is hard to do it on your own when you only get 15-20 min, I freeze under pressure, even though I can solve the problems on my own if I had more time. This makes me feel like I am bad a programming because I can't solve something under time pressure, and that programing is not worth it anymore, I am trying to do my best, but it never seems enough, or am I looking at this the wrong way. Honestly I feel this grading system sucks since we are not encouraged to fail, debug or even learn how our code works, speed is the only thing that matters and that means pasting everything AI throws, I'm seriously considering dropping from that class and take it next semester with other teacher. I could be wrong of course I just want some guidance as to what to do next, Is this grading system fine?",

        "content": "\\*EDIT: Title should be \"not a good **teacher\"**I hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.I just completed boot.dev's \"Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go\" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.In the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying \"yayayayaya\", or \"boom boom\", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.I would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.Secondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \\[\\]byte instead of string.The reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: \"Learn Go\", \"Build a Blog Aggregator in Go\" and \"Build an AI Agent in Python\". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.In Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",

        "author": "little_einschtein",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Tl:dr; I want to create an (ios + android) app that tells when the river has burst so people can evacuate. I’ve little to 0 experience in coding.Sorry, this is going to be long so I divided it into backstory and technical questions:——Backstory——I live in a small valley town in Malaysia. That said when it floods, ANNUALLY, it becomes a choke point for people travelling to, from and between cities, suburbs and rural areas.Last year, while a young couple died trying to feed stranded families with babies in cars, the young wife fatally fell into a storm drain (hidden by deep flood waters). Now, just last week it rained again and people are stranded - and I just heard that three people have died in the span of less than a week due to record level landslides in this region.Look, everyone knows everyone in this part of the world. So when someone dies, everyone is devastated. And it saddens me that it happens to the those with the best or intentions. Not to mentions property and income losses. I’m talking those who just bought a car to go to work and now it’s CAKED with silt while some have to spend tens of thousands replacing books, devices and furniture cause they didn’t have time to move their stuff elsewhere. You might be thinking why don’t they move their cars uphill or carry your fridge upstairs when it rains? Would you do that every time it rains? It’s a tropical country anyway. Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. If only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. Again I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that that’s just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so it’s like an early prevention mechanism. I’m thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. I realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if it’s just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. I’ll sleep more peacefully.——Technical Questions——App: 1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.3. How ”simple” will this app be? I’m not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.Flood detection:1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?General:- Is this possible? How long will this take me? NB: I’m gonna fund this entirely on my own and I’ll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.Obviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly don’t know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM. Thank you in advance.",

        "content": "It's day 4 of the very intense boot camp program school. I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. We're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The \"teachers\" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. I have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. I'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. I could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. Edit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.I'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. I have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. My life motto is \"one day or day one?\" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. Edit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)I know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions :face_with_tears_of_joy:), that does include my peers at 42. After failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. Now I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. So please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything. I will listen to those who have more experience than me.",

Like 'this' pointer is only being able to refer to the instance because the reference to an instance is baked into machine code.A) i found out 'this' pointer just passed to each function as invisible argument. Other OOP languages may work differently.M) I thought that OS is something different than machine code that regular peasants programs useA) It's same regular machine code, but It's more privileged. It has access to everything on the machine.M) The graphical interface of a programs made me think that's what programs are. A) Didn't see the true nature of programs, they consist of instructions to do computations and everything else what we call a graphical shell is merely a conveniences that are provided by Operating System software.M) I thought that GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is only device that is magically being able to draw 3D graphics.A) CPU could do the same but just really slow (no real time for demanding games), there's also integrated GPU that's built into \"processor\" but it's generally slower that dedicated ones.When there's no one explaining the computers from the low end to high end of course there's so much stupid assumptions and misconceptions. As a beginner coders in modern times we only start from the highest of abstractions in programming languages and only know about low end if we are curious enough. In the start of computers the programmers didn't have many high level programming languages so they knew what's going in their computers more than today's programmers.",

In the case of Java for example, I use Springboot and Kafka (With some basic bootstrap for the frontend) and JavaFX for the graphic interface.But with all of these languages how can I use them for a project? I know python tends to be used for scrypting or for AI integration but I have not delved into that nor I have had the need.To those that were in this situation or those that are in it, how do you tend to maximize/add other languages into your project? I do not say this for the sake of making things more difficult, I simply want to find a way in which I can make better projects or find a better value of what I'm learning. I fear that this year it might end up being a year in which I won't be able to do any real advancements because I will have to keep studying keywords, libraries and such instead of making actual projects that get you somewhere.EDIT: I have to study it because the classes this year demands it, my intention was to mostly stick with one until I feel that I'm more of an expert with it",

I want to spend my next 3 months dedicatively to learn any programming language to land on a job.I don't want to learn a language just because it was easy, I want to learn a language which will help me in a longer run. It should withstand for latest changes in the Programming fieldPlease Guys help me which one is best and what are the Pros and Cons of it? Try to help me with learning ways for it, I prefer to learn in English, Help me with any reddit communities to which is good for a learner to learn",

I’ve tried projects outside of class and completed them just fine, but it felt like reading a book without understanding what I’ve read.

On the other hand, I’ve already built and implemented some fundamental data structures on my own.So my questions are:1. Am I still considered a beginner at this stage, or somewhere in between beginner and intermediate?2. I also have an interest in web development, and I’m thinking of diving into that. But I also enjoyed C++ a lot. Should I keep pushing deeper into C++ (advanced topics + more DSA/algorithms) or pivot to web dev now?Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who went through a similar stage.Thanks!",

        "author": "BitBat16",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m struggling to enjoy studying. I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.Even when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.This year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soonRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.I might be spiraling My question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost I really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",

At first I thought it was just a puzzle game with logic gates… but it turned out to be much more. It gave me a hands-on understanding of logic gates, memory, and even simple CPU design. Hats off to devs for making something so educational yet so enjoyable.The game gradually pushes you from simple combinatorial circuits, to memory, to registers and to building a working CPU (LC-3 style) with your own instruction set. By the end you’re basically writing assembly for a custom ISA that you designed yourself.I’m not a computer engineer by training, but the concepts I picked up while playing \\[logic gates, adders, memory, instruction cycles and more\\] have been incredibly specific and useful later on. They gave me intuition that still helps me today as I'm trying to study C, data structures, and operating systems.It’s obviously not a replacement for textbooks, but for me it was a fantastic way to *feel* how computers work at a very low level, and it made the transition to more formal books study way smoother.Curious if anyone else here has tried it and how far you got — did you stop at logic gates, or did you programmed your CPU?",

I'm not frustrated with her at all. I'm more frustrated with myself since I feel like I've learned nothing so far and that it's been almost half a year. I feel like a fraud that always needs someone to guide them to code for difficult things or remember how a certain thing works. I hate feeling this way and making my partner feel bad since I really do appreciate it when she helps me.

I kinda feel like it’s the best option for me but I’m also not 100% sure.I keep hearing people say stuff like “AI is gonna take all our jobs,” and some people seem scared of going into CS because of that. But honestly I feel like this is the best time to do it, since everyone else is scared and maybe leaving space for me to get a job later.Right now I’m in what they call “preparatory years,” which is mostly math and physics for two years (calculus, analysis, linear algebra, thermodynamics, electrostatics, organic chemistry, all that stuff). After that, I’ll choose my major, probably CS unless something changes.My plan is to start self-teaching programming and development during these two years so by the time I actually get into CS I’m not a total beginner. I want to become good enough at coding and development by the end of the 5 years to freelance whenever I want and build some kind of financial freedom, so I’m not stuck depending on a job forever.I know it’s a big goal and I’m starting with zero experience in coding but I’m serious about making it work.Here’s what I’m worried about:\\* Is it actually possible to become really good at coding from zero in 5 years? Like good enough to freelance or get decent jobs?\\* Should I be scared about AI taking all the software jobs?\\* How safe is CS compared to other majors like mechanical or electrical engineering?\\* What should I be doing during these two prep years to prepare myself ? Like put yourself in my shoes for a second please.Sorry for the long post but I wanted to say everything that’s on my mind. I’d really appreciate honest advice, especially from anyone who’s been through this or is ahead of me.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,So, for anyone with some time to spare, I need some advice about a project I'd like to realize.I would like to code a pretty simple board game - basically, one that would involve throwing a dice to move your character on some tiles with various effects, and a kind of fortune wheel. No animation besides maybe the player's pawn moving along the way. Multiple players of course, and if not a true multiplayer, at least a way to make a program that could have various entries and parameters set by the gamemaster.I have a tad of experience with Python, and it'd be useful for me to learn more, so that would be my fav medium if possible, along with it allowing me to make it a downloable exe file.All that being said, what program/language/game engine would you recommend ? I looked up a few, and so far the most notable ones seem to be Pygames if I wanna do everything from scratch, or websites like Screentop or Boardgame.(Related coding question : how would you implement the different pathways a pawn can take with a given dice number ? My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement. What logic could I use to make my program give the player the option to say, with a throw of 4, go back and forth to end up on the same tile ?)Thank you so much in advance for your help, and have a good day !",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm working on an app that essentially allows you to log things you do throughout the day. So if I wake up at 7 AM and do Yoga on September 2, then later I look at the logs for September 2, I will see that I did in fact do Yoga at 7 AM.I'm really struggling with timezones, mainly because I have it in my head that times should always be stored in UTC, and it's a headache to get working.The standard advice is to store it in UTC and then convert to the users timezone when retrieving it, but this doesn't work here since I always want to see the log time relative to the timezone I was in at that time, not the one I'm in now (so if I was in California on September 2 when I did Yoga, then later I look at the log while I'm in New York, I still want to see that I did it at 7 AM, not that I did it 10 AM Eastern.)So the solution I came up with is to store started\\_at and ended\\_at in UTC, and also store the timezone offsets for wherever the user was at that time, that way I can always display the correct time for the logs. However, this seems really inefficient from a database indexing perspective. 99% of the log queries on the app are for a specific calendar day according to the users location on that day. Which means looking up logs for a specific day goes from the built in database timestamp magic, to having to query every log in a 3 day range, calculate the times adjusted for the saved timezone offset of that record, and then check if the date matches. So I also added a relative\\_start\\_date and relative\\_end\\_date to every log, which always stores whatever calendar date the log was started and finished on according to the user's timezone at that time. This way queries can easily be searched by date.The system kind of works, but I keep second guessing if it's really the best way. It feels like a lot of work and a lot of somewhat overlapping fields (started\\_at, ended\\_at, relative\\_start\\_date, relative\\_end\\_date, start\\_time\\_zone\\_offset, end\\_time\\_zone\\_offset) just to keep track of the time. It almost feels like it would be easier to just store the calendar date and then store start\\_time and end\\_time as seconds from midnight (and maybe an optional end\\_calendar\\_date for cases when the log spans two days), but I have it in my head that this is wrong and times should always be in stored in UTC.What do you guys think? How would you store times in this situation?",

Thus, I've decided to learn computer science in a real way, which led me to SICP.Look, I'm not dumb, but damn this book makes me feel like a moron. I'll be reading and getting it pretty well, and then it throws an exercise at me that makes me question my worth as a human being.Some of the exercises are fine, and I get it mostly right and understand what's going on with my mistakes, but some just feel way beyond me (it's the Simpson rule exercise that prompted me to write this btw).I guess I'm just wondering if this is a normal feeling, or do I need a new hobby? Again, to be fair, I actually feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of what the book is getting at; working through recursions from recursive and iterative frames was really instructive, and seeing the general summation formula was a big eureka moment for me, but good God that exercise brought me right back down to earth.",

        "author": "calmstoic2000",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and you’re trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.Context: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.Questions I struggle with repeatedly:1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly). Or is this trial-and-error method the only way to learn?",

Right now, I only know **JavaScript**, so the most natural solution for me seems to be **Electron JS** for building a desktop app.However, I have a few questions:1. Is Electron really **suitable** for this type of app that requires direct hardware access?2. Or would it be better to learn **Java**, **Python** (I’m starting to learn it), or even **C++** to have more control over the sensor?3. I’ve read that even with Electron, you often need a **backend in Python or another language** to act as a bridge between the app and the hardware. Is this really necessary, or can Electron handle it alone?I’m looking for the **most practical solution** for someone who already knows JS but is willing to learn another language if needed.",

With all the talk about recession and fewer companies hiring freshers, I feel very lost and anxious. I would love advice from experienced developers on: 1. Are these projects enough for a fresher-level job in web development? 2. What additional skills should I focus on learning next (e.g., Next.js, DevOps basics, system design)? 3. How should I approach job applications as a final-year student? Any honest guidance or roadmap would mean a lot :folded_hands: Thanks in advance!",

For example, while reading about layouts, [this example](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/constraints#example-22) mentions that FittedBox accepts only bounded widgets, which is not mentioned in the doc page for [FittedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FittedBox-class.html)So by posting this, I just want a reality check.

I don't know I have gone through various syntax and concepts within 14 days of intense self learning. I studied core syntax like arrays,dictionaries,variables, object types,control flow and OOP concepts- properties ,classes, methods, inheritance , polymorphism,derived classes lot more, async programming, little work with HttpClient(postasync , json ), file I/O and I practiced everything I learnt with visual studio code software. Today I started to learn Data Structures and Algorithms since lots of blogs saying it is better to learn DSA to improve logical thinking and problem solving skills.I want to know what I am missing and what can I do to improve my journey to a better C# programmer.

But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.This is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\\---If current\\_frame == 1: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\\_1 on screenif current\\_frame ==2: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\\_2 on screen\\---etc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.I'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.This may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals.

Right now I have more of an uninformed ideological view on this as in 'LLMs and their crawlers/scrapers bad'.I do see the merit in search engines and their crawlers though and since AI bots - even if they are overhyped and burning the earth - might have some merit to them, would it even make sense to block them?## Second questionI've written a webserver to host my personal website. Hosting and setup was smooth, it's just a go web-app behind caddy as my reverse proxy.

The recruiter I spoke to said that they have weekly career coaching and meeting with recruiters, 90% of alums get job offers within the first three months of completing the program and many people get offers before the program is even over. I do have a degree but in a completely unrelated field. This all sounds too good to be true, but I’m getting some mixed info online with people saying it depends on the bootcamp, others saying they did get a job right away, and many who never claim to have gone to a bootcamp to begin with saying it’s not worth it. So this question is specifically for people who have gone through a bootcamp with QuickStart, is it worth it? Did you get a job soon after? And if you don’t mind answering, what was your starting salary?",

Extra rent costs, electricity costs, harder to hire themselves. Well it does, but less than their employees switching around so easily. The big companies are evenmoreh hell bent on RTO because they know they'll always have people willing to interview for them. It's similar to how companies give very low hikes and risk employees leaving them. Sure they make a loss on the people who switch but they bet on most people *not* switching than switching. This plan gets foiled when employees are at home and can easily interview at their homes. Edit: Of course people switch even with wfo but it's much harder. Also it's a factor, not the sole reason.

        "author": "d_wilson123",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground. I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer. Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers. As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go. However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer. [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people. This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.] Here is some of my experiences.Working at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out. A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is. My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer. If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows. These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs. I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves. We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD. My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff. The cluster was owned and operated by someone else. But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services. There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out. There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box. But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves. This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer. My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team. At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else. Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included. The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales. But not everything was managed. So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points. This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time. Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job. So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as \"How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?\" were complete unknowns. We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch. Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly. They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options. So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down. So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that. My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company. But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding. The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it \"just worked\" without having to think about it too terribly much.This is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice. If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it. My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go. However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform. I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now. It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",

And how do you even “do a project?”Here’s what I mean. I know there’s the “calculator project” and whatnot but those are overdone and done to death, and is as useful to your portfolio as nothing (maybe even detrimental as it lacks any sense of originality). But having literally never “done a project” before I can’t think of one I can actually do that is cool. There’s just too many complicated parts and it is difficult to map out how to get started (I.e. what types of tooling I would need, what objects I’d need, how they will interact etc). I just feel completely overwhelmed when thinking of a project and as a result never actually get to it or abandon it. Any suggestions?",

Everyone is offshore except for me.The issue is that we’re about a month into this new project (we all got onboarded at the same time since we’re taking over from an outbound team) and everyone on the team seems lost. As a junior, isn’t my job to be learning from everyone else and working on small tasks here and there? Instead, I just led a 4 hour bridge call the other night at 11pm by myself for a critical incident. Everyone on the team keeps asking me questions, including our team lead who, to be blunt, appears to be technically incompetent. It feels like no actual work gets done unless I prod people and help them out to get things moving along. On top of that, the team lead dumps his tickets on me when he finds out he has no idea how to do it. Now I’m not gonna say I’m a 10x dev or anything, but at the bare minimum shouldn’t these guys have a better grasp of the project from the KTs than me?My manager is always busy since he’s dealing with 2-3 other teams so he’s not aware of this (I also haven’t brought it up). Has anyone else dealt with something like this? I feel like I’m not growing since there’s nobody to learn from, and it doesn’t feel right to be acting as a team lead when I’m the most junior person.

I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),This kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the \"low-level\", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.Now I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.I struggle to use git lolCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusingI struggle with database stuffI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own \"OOP\" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.Get fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shitAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool \"high level\" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.It's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.None of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).None of these things are \"software\" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).To be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.Any insights or advice is much appreciated.",

I never really did this stuff to make money (of course I always hoped that it would pay off each time) but simply for the love of the game. I genuinely think me building all these websites in the past taught me a lot and turned me into a really good engineer. Now, I'm in your typical big tech company making 250k.The other day, a friend reached out with an idea for a tool. The idea makes sense to me and doesn't sound too difficult to build. He also has a pipeline to market it and already some validation so I would only have to handle the tech stuff so I immediately told him I'm down.However thinking about it after, I'm wondering if it's the smartest thing to do. I like to think that I'm good at what I do so even at work I only work 8h and it's not too bad but now that I'm making plenty of money, I'm not sure if I want to spend time and effort on trying to build random things.Do you guys think it's worth it?

        "content": "Hey all, I've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. Not saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.From my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. On the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more \"pass/fail\" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. I think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.Basically two styles: \"textbooker\" who want puzzle masters, vs. \"collaborative\" who prioritize discussion and personality.And don't get me started on communication styles.

But overall, the field is frankly ruining my life.The amount of stress caused by this job is unreal. Before people say, \"well, you could be a retail or or x worker\". I actually worked those jobs, unlike many in this field who say that line. I wasn't even close to as stressed as I am in this field. I would probably still work them if they paid the bills, but they don't. At least in the US.The unrealistic deadlines, the mismanagement of projects that then gets dumped on the devs to make up for, the work culture that comes from overseas because this field is filled with abused H1B workers. I see things eventually turning into 996 schedules in the US if this doesn't stop.Then to escape horrible jobs...you have to practice interviewing on your own free time. Interviews have rarely anything to do with what you do on the job. Thanks to all the endless technology programmers have to make up every year, good luck keeping up with everything. Also, look forward to 3-5 rounds of BS each time. Good luck finding the time to do this if you have a job you hate. I guess good luck if you run out of days to use for interviews. I guess you just have to quit your job or get fired to escape?I'm seeing a therapist but it isn't helping. They even admit that most of my problems sound like it comes from this job field. They say they have never heard of a work field in the US that is this bad from any of their clients in other fields.Can't really change job fields because I can't afford to go back to college debt now. Any job that pays a middle class lifestyle to own a basic house requires a degree these days. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am just tired. How do I just find some peace in this field? I don't want FAANG wages. I want a descent 40 hour job that is low stress and I'm fine with low pay. As long as it pays the basic bills. One where I can just stay at the job without worrying about layoff or the next management rolling in to start turning a job into a PIP factory.Is that really too much to ask in this field?",

Someone please tell me if I'm still low balling myself.Edit: I'm a woman, if that means anything. Some of us are constantly undervaluing ourselves :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",

The tasks I had been given to work on had been one script for a data transfer I did finish, then fixes for two bugs that I haven't been able to figure out at all so far. The other engineer that started the same day as me had been working on different things, but seemed to do a lot more so far. I had been letting other engineers on my team know where I'm getting stuck, they would give me recommendations that I tried implementing, then I try using those and they don't work. It's pretty much been that cycle for those two bugs that I tried working on (namely the latter since the former was lower priority). When I met with my manager last month, he didn't have any concerns with my performance so far, but I imagine that that wouldn't mean much. I feel like I'm starting to question whether I have what it takes for the job in a way, and I feel kind of bad about myself compared to other people that always seem to know what to do.I know PIP culture is a big thing here, so I feel like I should probably start studying up on LeetCode/System Design for if I need to start applying again. At the same time, I didn't have much to write about on my resume for applying. Does anyone have any advice, by any chance?",

Any advice would also be great, but I know there is none for me, it's just being lucky in finding a company that wants to take a chance on you. But I have to be honest, this is making me kind of depressed, applying day in and day out, getting automated rejection after rejection whilst also going on interviews and hearing back later saying the same damn line as I mentioned earlier, or them saying \"your profile is great and we see a good match but there simply isn't any work for a junior atm\".Thanks for sharing guys.",

The company has already paid around 600$ for my hotel room and is compensating travel to be here. I could probably push through the day but my biggest concern is getting someone whose immunocomprised or an elderly family member of a coworker seriously ill. These are my thoughts please let me know if this is an acceptable course of action, I'm honestly panicking hard I put so much effort in for this opportunity and I don't want to immediately shoot myself in the foot: - Send email now with test photo, explain that I feel well enough to come in masked but I am afraid of spreading if there is anyone immunocomprised and I'm unsure of company policy regarding this. Offer to work from home. - Wake up early and call ASAP saying the same thing. Try and make it to a clinic for meds to shorten duration and for additional proof of illness. Update: They are sending me back home and letting me on-board remotely, then likely sending me back out in a couple weeks. They were really chill about it and thanked me for letting them know and not coming in sick.",

Current valuation is 60M after series A with 5M ARR and less than 20 employees. The downsides obviously include instability and the risk the equity is worth toilet paper. Unique to this role includes high amounts of travel. It's also riding the AI bubble so if that pops it would impact this company's perceived value and ability to get customers.I might work like hell, get laid off in 6 months, have a resume that looks like shit? Or maybe the company will blow up and ill pick up a nest egg? I had one role for 16 months, and my current one would be 15 months, so I'm really worried about my resume optics if I take this job and they go under or I learn that I absolutely hate it.

        "content": "TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?Frustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.QA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.Planning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.Architecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.For example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.I’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. I’ll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of “no it’s not” or “prove it”… so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told “stop being too technical”. Basically they don’t trust me when I tell them something is problematic, and then still don’t understand when I show the code causing the issue. It’s a no-win situation.1:1 with the tech lead who said basically “we don’t need to worry about good principles because we can rewrite the whole app in a month if we really had to, just chill out and stop worrying, the company isn’t really affected.” I disagree wholeheartedly, I think our performance has the ability to kill the company by destroying our customer’s trust from the sheer amount of bugs and misrepresented data in the product.",

It was previously understood that you really don't need a Master's for an entry level role in CS, but getting one could mean a nice increase in pay compared to those with just a Bachelors. But now I am seeing more people applying for entry-level positions with a Master's. I believe we are reaching a point where having a Master's is the bare minimum for post-grad job hunting. What do you guys think? I haven't heard much back besides a couple of OAs since graduating with my Bachelors in CS earlier this year in May, and I think this silent shift might have to do something about it. Not saying it isn't possible to get an entry-level role with only a Bachelor's, but from a company point of view, are you going to hire someone with a Bachelor's over a Master's? Love to know your guy's opinions on this, not a topic I see discussed a lot.",

My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my mom’s cancer spread again last month. I’ve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.I’m a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. It’s not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but I’ve been there over a year and it’s remote so I can visit my mom. A few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. It’s also remote and I’ve been there over a year so I qualify for FMLA.I am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.I had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. I’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t.I don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I don’t even want to try to take the assessment because I’m so overwhelmed, I’m behind at my current job and don’t have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least I’m comfortable though.I guess I’m just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter. How can I withdrawal in a way that could potentially leave the door open for future opportunities?",

        "content": "I'm posting for a friend since they don't have enough karma to post here:I graduated in recent years and secured a software engineer job a couple months after graduation doing standard dev work in the traditional way (no AI). Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.I've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.I’m concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.In the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, I’m concerned that my skills will not have grown here. I’ve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.Still being very early in my career, I’m wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.I personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone who’s inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.So regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.Are there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?",

        "author": "theploop",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.I’ve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.A friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.I did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.For context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.So my questions are:• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?Would love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",

I have a quite decent (at least in my country it's considered decent, but not some really high level) IT background with several years of system administration and a software engineer college degree (technically I can code, but my job has never required something more serious than Python/Bash QoL scripts, so my coding skills are probably somewhere around junior), but for some reason I feel like except the general basics it does not apply to LLMs/AI. I mean... theoretically I could get a job where I'd have to develop a mobile/desktop app that is built around AI or something like that, but it's not what I'm looking for.

        "content": "**TL;DR:** I’ve worked \\~9 years in the same IT company (mostly backend, some frontend + DevOps). My salary is low (\\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \\~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.Hey everyone,I've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.The challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so it’s hard to compare my experience with \"standard\" projects. That’s why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.# What I builtI made two projects:* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.# The ideaUsers can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.I intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a \"real\" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.# What I worked with**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**Users can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (€/$), theme (light/dark).* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.**DevOps**I Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.**Content**I wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.# Code & live appsGitHub repo for Rails app: [Sparenzi Web](https://sparenzi.eu/) and [Repo](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenziweb/tree/master)(There are few commits because I developed in a private GitLab repo and only published the final version here)GitHub repo for React Native app: [Sparenzi](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenzi)# What I'd love to know* How would you rate my project execution? (both technically and as a portfolio piece)* What should I improve before showing this to recruiters / potential employers?* Based on what I’ve shown here, should I present myself as junior, mid, or senior developer?* I’m considering taking on freelance jobs in the \\~$20/h range (about 20h/week alongside my current job). Is this realistic, or should I ask for more/less per hour and more/less hours per week?Any honest feedback is super welcome — I’m trying to figure out my real position on the market so I can plan my next steps.Thanks!",

But let’s say I decide to stick with Node.js—how much growth can I realistically expect? Will I hit a ceiling faster compared to other stacks, or are the specific stacks less important and companies care more about core concepts than the language itself? I’m stuck.",

My plan had been to complete the Codecademy professional certifications (Data Scientist: ML Specialist and Analytics Specialist), but I'm wondering if a more recognized credential like the \"IBM Data Science Professional Certificate\" or something else would be better.Put simply, I'm not sure whether I'm approaching this in the best way. I'd love advice on:\\- how to express the value of my PhD experience in applications/interviews\\- whether certifications like Codecademy or IBM are worth pursuing\\- any strategies for building a portfolio as someone coming from academiaIf you or someone you know has made a transition like this one, I'd be grateful for any guidance you can share.

What field would you suggest that will be good for me to get into at this point. I am a fast learner. Alot of my past class fellows have already switched to a CS based careers because of poor Electrical job market in my country. They are working in app development, web development amd cybersecurity. So what CS based career do you think i should go into. Your opinion will help me alot in my decision. Thank you very much.",

I have started to dislike development work and wanted to pivot away from it. I'm not really sure at the moment what I want to do, but had an interest in trying for an infra / ops role.I somehow managed to stumble upon and receive an offer for a \"Cloud Engineer\" position. Upon learning more about the position the role and research, the role seems to be like a Platform Engineer. Essentially I would be working on the company's Internal Developer Portal (IDP) powered by Backstage helping to research new developer tooling, supporting new pipelines, and helping to modernize and onboard applications teams to the platform. I believe another term for this would be building out a \"low code\" internal cloud platformI have no connections that have experience working with IDPs so wanted to take a shot in the dark and seek out any engineers in this area of work or have worked adjacently with it and ask the following questions:1. Am I pigeonholing myself to a certain niche in this kind of role? How applicable does work in this kind of position apply to other DevOps roles?2. In your experience how difficult has it been getting application teams to transition to this kind of platform?3. Is this an upcoming way of approaching and accelerating enterprise app deployment or has this been a relatively niche approach to maintaining infrastructure and operations that only certain companies pilot?Any help on this would be appreciated as I have literally never seen this sort of position even within my current company.",

An example of this would be that there is a de facto \"Send Email\" class that someone wrote years ago. This class does all the work (updates tables, generates the PDF, calls the web API, etc), all I really do is feed it the string for the body of the email. Even when I am creating new processes, it is mostly just sticking together these already existing classes. It would be inefficient and increase risks of introducing bugs to the codebase if I tried to create a different Send Email class for my process. It kind of makes me feel like less of a software engineer and more like I am just writing glue to fit these already existing puzzle pieces together.",
