        "author": "BoredAt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is a long article, so sit down and get some popcorn :slightly_smiling_face:At this point everyone here has already read of the newest merger on the block. I think it's been (at least for me) a bit difficult to get the full story of why and whats going. I’m going to try to give what I suspect is really going on here and why it's happening.*TLDR: Fivetran is getting squeezed on both sides and DBT has hit its peak, so they’re trying to merge to take a chunk off the warehouses and reach Databricks valuation (10b atm -> 100b Databricks/Snowflake)*First, a collect of assumptions from my side:* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the top by warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake) commoditizing EL for their enterprise contracts. Why ask your enterprise IT team to get legal to review another vendor contract (which will take another few 100ks of the budget) when you can do just 1 vendor? With EL at cost (cause the money is in query compute, not EL)?* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the bottom by much cheaper commoditized vendors (Airbyte, DLTHub, Rivery, etc.)* DBT has peaked and isn’t really growing much.For the first, the [proof](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-open-data-infrastructure) from DBTs article:> As a result, customers became frustrated with the tool-integration challenges and the inability to solve the larger, cross-domain problems. Customers began demanding more integrated solutions—asking their existing vendors to “do more” and leave in-house teams to solve fewer integration challenges themselves. Vendors saw this as an opportunity to grow into new areas and extend their footprints into new categories. This is neither inherently good nor bad. End-to-end solutions can drive cleaner integration, better user experience, and lower cost. But they can also limit user choice, create vendor lock-in, and drive up costs. The devil is in the details.> In particular, the data industry has, during the cloud era, been dominated by five huge players, each with well over $1 billion in annual revenue: Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Each of these five players started out by building an analytical compute engine, storage, and a metadata catalog. But over the last five years as the MDS story has played out, each of their customers has asked them to “do more.” And they have responded. Each of these five players now includes solutions across the entire stack: ingestion, transformation, notebooks and BI, orchestration, and more. They have now effectively become “all-in-one data platforms”—bring data, and do everything within their ecosystem.For the second point, you only need to go to the pricing page of any of the alternatives. Fivetran is expensive, plan and simple. For the third, I don’t really have any formal proof. You can take it as my opinion I suppose.With those 3 facts in mind, it seems like the game for DBTran (I’m using that name from now one :slightly_smiling_face:) is then to try to flip the board on the warehouses. Normally, the data warehouse is where things start, with other tools (think data catalogs, transformation layer, semantic layer, etc.) being an add on that they try to commoditize. This is why snowflake and databricks are worth 100b+. Instead, DBTran is trying to make the warehouse be the commodity. This is namely by using a somewhat new tech. Iceberg (not gonna explain iceberg here, feel free to read that elsewhere).If Iceberg is implemented, then compute and storage are split. The traditional warehouse vendors (bigquery, clickhouse, snowflake, etc.) are simply compute engines on top of the iceberg tables. Merely another component that can be switched out at will. Storage is an s3 bucket. DBTran would then be the rest. It would look a bit like:* Storage - **S3, GCS, etc.** * Compute - **Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.*** Iceberg Catalog - **DBTran*** EL - **DBTran*** Transformation Layer - **DBTran*** Semantic Layer - **DBTran**They could probably add more stuff here. Buy Lightdash maybe and get into BI? But I don’t imagine they would need to (not a big enough market). Rather, I suspect they want to take a chunk off the big guys. So get that sweet, sweet compute enterprise budget by carving them out in half and eating it.So should anyone in this subreddit care? I suppose it depends. If you don’t care about what tool you use, its business as usual. You’ll get something for EL, something for T and so on. Data engineering hasn’t fundamentally changed. If you care about OSS (which I do) then this is worth watching. I’m not sure if this is good or bad. I wouldn’t switch to DBT Fusion anytime soon. But if by any chance DBTran make the semantic layer and the EL OSS (even on an elastic license) then this might actually be a good thing for OSS. Great even.But I wouldn’t bet on that. DBT made Metricsflow proprietary. Fivetran is proprietary. If you want OSS, its best to look elsewhere.",

I work mainly with AWS, and I’m having some trouble understanding exactly how Databricks improves a pipeline and in what ways it simplifies development.Right now, we’re using Athena + dbt, with MWAA for orchestration. We’ve fully adopted Athena, and one of its best features for us is the federated query capability. We currently use that to access all our on-prem data, we’ve successfully connected to SAP Business One, SQL Server and some APIs, and even went as far as building a custom connector using the SDK to query SAP S/4HANA OData as if it were a simple database table.We’re implementing the bronze, silver, and gold (with iceberg) layers using dbt, and for cataloging we use AWS Glue databases for metadata, combined with Lake Formation for governance.And so for our dev experience is just making sql code all day long, the source does not matter(really) ... If you want to move data from the OnPrem side to Aws you just do \"create table as... Federated (select * from table) and that's it... You moved data from onprem to aws with a simple Sql, it applies to every source So my question is: could you provide clear examples of where Databricks actually makes sense as a framework, and in what scenarios it would bring tangible advantages over our current stack?",

        "content": "I've been in the data space for about 10 years after an academic journey studying mathematics. The first 8 years of my career was in a consulting company doing a mixture of analytics and data migration activities as part of SaaS implementations (generally ERP/CRM systems). I guess an important thing to note was I genuinely felt like I knew what I was doing and was critical within the implementation projects. A couple of years ago I switched to a data architecture role at a tech company. Since day 1 I've felt behind my peers who I feel have much stronger skills in data modeling. With my consulting background and lack of formal CS learning, I feel like my knowledge of a traditional development lifecycle are missing and consequently feel like I deliver sub par work, along with other imposter syndrome type effects. Realistically I know the company wanted me for my experience and skills and maybe to be different to existing employees but I can't shake the feeling of unease. Any suggestions to improve here? Stick it out longer and hope things become clearer (they have over time but it's still hard to keep up), or return to the consulting world where I was more comfortable but now armed with a few more technical skills and less corporate bullshit.",

I’m a data analyst but at my company we have a program where we get to work with the data engineering team part time for 6 weeks to learn about to build out some of our data infrastructure. For example, building out silver layer data tables that we want access to. This allows us to self serve a little bit so we can help expedite things that we need for our teams. It was a cool experience and I really learned a lot. I didn’t know much about data engineering before hand and I was wondering, how much time do DEs really spending on the “plumbing”? This was my first exposure to the medial data structure as well so idk if it’s different for other places that don’t use that but is that like a huge part of being a data engineer? It’s it mainly building out these cleanses tables? I know when new data sources are brought it that there is set up there, I was part of that too but I feel like the bulk of what was going on was building out silver and gold layers. How much time do you guys actually spend on that kind of work? And is it mundane as it can seem at time? Or did I just have easy work haha",

        "author": "No_Net369",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Sorry I’m posting from a new account as my main one indicates my full name.I'm a fairly new hire at a fintech company that deals with payment data from a bunch of different banks and clients. I was hired a few months ago as a Data Analyst but the role has become super flexible right now, and I'm basically the only person purely focused on data.I spent the first few months under the Operations team helping with reconciliation (since my manager, who is now gone, wasn't great at it), using Excel/Google Sheets and a few Python scripts to expedite that process. That messy part is thankfully over, and I'm free to do data stuff.The problem is, I'm not experienced enough to lead a data team or even know the best place to start. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out how to shape my role, what to prioritize, and how to set myself up for growth.I’m comfortable with Python and SQL and have some exposure to Power BI, but not advanced. Our stack includes AWS, Metabase via PostgreSQL (for reporting to clients/partners or to expose our data to non technical colleagues e.g. customer support). No Snowflake or Spark that I'm aware of. Any data engineering tasks are currently handled by the software engineers.Note: A software engineer who left some time ago used dbt for a bit and I'm very interested in picking this up, if relevant. I was given a mix of BAU reporting tasks (client growth, churn rate, performance metrics, etc.) but the CTO gave me a 3-month task to investigate our current data practices, suggest improvements, and recommend new tools based on business needs (like Power BI).My ideal plan is to slowly transition into a proper Data Engineering role. I want to take over those tasks from the developers, build a more robust and automated reporting pipeline, and get hands-on with ETL practices and more advanced coding/SQL. I want to add skills to my CV that I'll be proud of and are also in demand.I'd really appreciate any advice on two main areas:1. a. What are the most effective things I can do right now to improve my daily work and start shaping the data?b. How do I use the currently available tools (PostgreSQL, Metabase, Python) to make my life easier when generating reports and client insights? Should I try to resurrect and learn dbt to manage my SQL transformations?c. Given the CTO's task, what kind of \"wrong practices\" should I be looking for in our current data processes?2.a. How do I lay the foundation for a future data engineering role, both in terms of learning and advocating for myself?b. What should I be learning in my spare time to get ready for data engineering tasks (i.e., Python concepts, ETL/ELT, AWS courses)?c. How do I effectively communicate the need for more proper Data Engineering tools/processes to the higher-ups and how do I make it clear I want to be doing that in the future?Sorry for the long post, and I'm aware of any red flags you see as well, but I need to stay in this role for at least a year or two (for my CV to have that fintech experience) so I want to make the best out of it. Thanks!",

        "content": "This question is purely an engineering question: I don't care about analytical benefits, only about ETL pipelines and so on.Also, this question is for a low data volume environment and a very small DE/DA team.I wonder what benefits could I obtain if I stored not only how sales data is right now, but also how it was at any given point in time.We have a bucket in S3 where we store all data, and we call it a data lake: I'm not sure if that's accurate, because I understand that, for modern standards, historical snapshots are kinda common. What I don't know is if they are common because business analytical requirements dictate it, or if I, as DE, will benefit from it.Also, there's the issue of cost. Using Iceberg (what I would use) on S3 to achieve h.s. must increase costs: on what factor? what does the increase depend on?Edit 1h later: Thanks to all of you for taking the time to reply.Edit 1h later number 2: Conclusions drawn: The a) absence of a clear answer to the question and the presence of b) b.1) references to data modeling, business requirements and other analytical concepts, plus b.2) an unreasonable amount (>0) of avoidable unkind comments to the question, made me c) form this thin layer of new knowledge: There is no reason to think about historical snapshots of data in an environment where it's not required by downstream analytics or business requirements. Storing historical data is not required to maintain data lake-like structures and the ETL pipelines that move data from source to dashboards.",

This retail company sets annual targets in dollars for purchases and sales, so these targets are yearly. The fact table als has a Year attribute. A solution might be to use a Date attribute?Ultimately, I need to create a table visualization in PowerBI that combines data from these two fact tables along with some additional measures.Sometimes, I need to filter by type, so TransactionType and TargetType must be linked.I feel like using a bridge table might be “cheating,” so I’m curious: what would be the correct approach according to Kimball principles?",

        "content": "Hello! Been a reader in this sub for quite some time. I have started a part time job where I am tasked to create a dashboard. No specific software is being required by the client, but I have chosen Looker Studio because the client is using Google as their work environment (sheets + drive). I would love to keep the cost low, or in this case totally free for the client but it's kinda hard working with Looker (I say PBI has better features imo). I am new in this so I don't wanna overcharge the client with my services, thankfully they don't demand much or give a very strict deadline.I have done all my transforms in my own personal work Gmail using Drive + Sheets + Google Apps Script because all of the raw data are just csv files. My dashboard is working and setup as intended, but it's quite hard to do the \"queries\" I need for each visualization -- I just do a single sheet for each \"query\" because star schema and joins does not work for Looker? I feel like I can do this better, but I am stuck.Here are my current concerns:1. If the client asks for more, like automation and additional dashboard features, would you have any suggestions as to how I can properly scale my workflow? I have read about GCP's storage and Bigquery, tried the free trial and I setup it wrong as my credits was depleted in a few days?? I think it's quite costly and overkill for a data that is less than 50k rows according to ChatGPT. 2. Per my title, how can I \"sell\" this project to the client? What I mean is if in case the client wants to end our contract, like if they are completely satisfied with my simple automation, how can I transfer the ownership to them if I am currently using my personal email?*PS. I am* ***not*** *a Data analyst by profession nor working in Tech. I am just a guy who likes to try stuff and thankfully I got the chance to work on a real project after doing random Youtube ETL and dashboard projects. Python is my main language, so doing the above work using GAS(Javascript via ChatGPT lol) is quite a new experience to me.*",

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "About a year ago, I got a job as a software engineer at a major global tech company. The job description was listed as a software engineer involved with DevOps tools like AWS, Terraform, Docker, and scripting. The process felt standard for tech roles, similar to companies like Amazon, but involved 2 hiring managers present in each meeting, which I thought was unusual. It was my first full-time corporate position too, and after facing a one-year gap post-graduation, I thought beggars can’t be choosers.A few days after starting, however, I was informed that I’d actually be working under the other hiring manager. The original manager, who conducted most of my application process, didn’t need anyone on his team; instead, my actual manager (the other hiring manager) was the one who needed me. They had posted the job under the original manager’s name because it was tied to his cost center, which had lower salary brackets and more resources for vacancies. I found this out on my own later down the line.Initially, I didn’t think much of it and decided to see how things played out. At first, I was coding and doing cloud-related tasks. However, after six months, I realized my work was far from what was advertised as approximately 70% of my tasks involved Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Apps, with only 30% on actual dev and cloud work. Given they knew my goals and cloud-centric skills, I felt scammed.As I came to terms with this, I pretty much lost motivation to learn Power Platform, often utilizing AI for most tasks. What was advertised as a software engineering role turned out to be more of a data analyst position working with upper management. Despite the lack of effort on my part, I still managed to meet deadlines, and my work received recognition, even leading to bonuses and a salary bump eight months in.Anyways, I’m now 1 year into this job. You might wonder why I’ve stayed till now? Honestly, the role is quite easy. I work remotely and don’t need to exert much brain power on my projects as most require basic research because the company lags behind in current practices. Another big reason I've stuck around is the ability to apply for jobs abroad after staying 1.5 years with the company. More importantly, however, is that I also unexpectedly hit the “jackpot” in one of my recent projects, where I was provided access to payroll data. By combining projects I worked on, I can indirectly figure out the highest-paying roles and the best countries, offices, and teams to work in. I discovered that my manager earns ten times my salary, with his N+1 earning three times as much and N+2 earning five times as much, respectively. I discovered my country consistently offers the shittiest salaries too, and that I need to get out of here if I ever have the chance.As a result, I plan to apply internally to the best jobs in my company based on the salary knowledge I’ve now acquired. Since I’m coasting most of the day at my current job, I had initially decided to sharpen my cloud and system design skills and also focus on LeetCode. But I’ve been thinking that, since a lot of my actual work experience over the past year has been data-centric, I could combine that with my previous cloud and DevOps skills to pursue a Data Engineering role, at least marketing myself as such. I believe my current experience + newly acquired skills would give me a better chance of success in applying for data engineering roles rather than purely DevOps ones. However, my main concern is needing to learn many more technologies in six months. Thus, my question is, which path is more realistic for my career? Is Data Engineering as future-proof as full-scale infrastructure/system design? And more importantly, to those with years in the field, what is the smartest career path moving forward?",

I've bounced around between different roles frequently, which primes me well for a leadership position but I first have some gaps to fill. I started as a BI Developer but also did the data warehouse architecture and ETL loading. I designed a data warehouse from the ground up with my manager simply coaching but zero micro managing. Then I feel like my career took an unexpected turn, I took a job at a smaller firm. It ended up being more system administration with data engineering on the side but definitely more traditional data engineering than I did as a BI dev. I didn't have a manager so the skills I really learned was working with the owners/directly with leadership but it was a small firm and not as formal as I've seen at medium to large companies. No real formal quarterly planning but I was directly responsible for anything that happened or was needed. I really learned to solve whatever problem is thrown at me and I now have the confidence to attack any problem thrown at me. On the technical side I automated their manual workflow, mistakenly using SSIS, because I didn't know better. I later migrated them to the cloud with the support of a very very good consultant. He really liked my ability to learn and solve new problems and I'm still in contact with him today. After migration my job became more of a system administrator but also added new sources to the pipeline. No architecture or modeling responsibilities though. Next I found a job as an architect based in the cloud. Once again I had no technical people above me. I think this job was a a reach for me, I didn't know what I didn't know and oversold myself. Still I made it work and got my cloud pipelines built but mostly using the interface vs coding the way I expect most companies to work. We used S3, glue, RDS and lambda. This was short lived due to funding for the project and likely because I was over my head. Her I took a step back and just wanted to be a data engineer at a medium to large company. This was all good until we got offshored. I'm now working through the remaining months of that job while I look for a new one. Unfortunately it seems the traditional data flow knowledge isn't very wanted anymore and I spent the last 7 years learning more of the administration and leadership side vs technical skills. Am I simply screwed? Do I have to scramble to learn spark and get AWS engineering certified before I'll be valuable to a company again? I keep getting calls from Linkin recruiters who want me to lead a cloud engineering team but I'm looking for a job as one of those engineers, not their leader. The salary doesn't even seem to be the issue, the issue is no one is looking for general data skills to help train into cloud engineers. I knew u was goin to have to learn throughout my career but I didn't expect this drastic of a shift. I almost fell like front end web developers are in a better position than traditional data people.",

After a couple of months I felt drained out physically and mentally and had to step back for only my working hours and to protect my health, especially that they don’t give me any extra compensation or promotion for this. In this migration project I am working solo and carrying out planning, BA, business interaction, dev, BI, QA, and data gov & administration and the scope is only getting bigger.Last week there was an ongoing discussion between scrum master trying to highlight it’s already too much for me and that I shouldn’t be engaged as the main developer in other tasks and team lead who said that I am a crucial team member and they need me in other projects as well. I am connecting with both tmw but I wanna seek your advice on how to best manage these escalating situations and not let it affect my life and health over 0 mental or financial compensation.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So we're going to have a baby in a few weeks, and I was thinking obviously how can I use my data skills for my baby. I vaguely remembered I saw a video or read an article where someone, somewhere said that they were able to predict their wife's delivery time (with few minutes accuracy) based on accurately measuring contraction start and end times, as contraction lengths tend to be longer and longer as the delivery time approaches. After a quick Google search, I found the video! It was made by [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7q0Y2W0Rn4) 7 years ago, but somehow I remembered it. If you look at the [chart](https://youtu.be/k7q0Y2W0Rn4?si=vz_S1LCIsLeYs10v&t=275) in the video, the graph and trend lines feel a bit \"exaggerated\", but let's assume it's true.So I found a bunch of apps for timing contractions but nothing that provides predictions of the estimated delivery time. I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lbrp5f/oc_attempt_to_duplicate_steve_moulds_graph_for/) created 5 years ago, but the blog post describing the calculations is not available anymore. Anyway, I tried to reproduce a similar logic & graph in Python as a Streamlit app, [available in GitHub](https://github.com/vmatt/predict-my-baby). With my synthetic dataset it looks good, but I'd like to get some real data, so I can adjust the regression fitting on proper data. My ask would be for the community: 1. if you know any datasets that are publicly available, could you share with me? I found an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201517), but I'm not sure how [can this](https://www.physionet.org/lightwave/) be translated into contraction start and end times. 2. Or if you already have kid, and you logged contraction lengths (start time/end time) with an app from which you can export into CSV/JSON/whatever format, please share that with me! Also sharing the actual delivery time would be needed so I can actually test it. (and any other data that you are willing to share - age, weight, any treatments during the pregnancy)I plan to reimplement the final version with html/js, so we can use it offline.Note: I'm not a data scientist by the way. Just someone who works with data and enjoys these kinds of projects. So I'm sure there are better approaches than simple regression (maybe XGBoost or other ML techniques?), but I'm starting simple. I also know that each pregnancy is unique, contraction lengths and delivery times can vary heavily based on hormones, physique, contractions can stall, speed up randomly, so I have no expectations. But I'd be happy to give it a try, if this can achieve 20-60 minutes of accuracy, I'll be happy.Update: I want to add, that my wife approves this",

I think Databricks Delta Lake can compress parquet files like this automatically, does something like this exist for GCP? Is my solution a good practice? Could something better be done?",

They have another team of backend engineers with a dozen employees. This allow the company to have backend engineers taking part of an on call in turns (with a financial compensation). However on my side it's impossible to have such thing in place as it would mean I'd be on call all the time (illegal & not desirable).The main pain point is that regularly (2-3 times/month) backend engineers break our data infrastructure on prod with some fix releases they made while on call. I also feel that sometimes they deploy new features as I receive DB schema updates with new tables on the weekend (I don't see many cases where fixing a backend error would imply to create a new table).Sometimes I fix those failures over the weekend on my personal time if I caught the alert notifications but sometimes I just don't check my phone or work laptop. Backend engineers are not responsible for the data infra like me, most of them don't know how it works and they don't have access to it for security reasons.In such situation what would be the best solution?Training the backend engineers on our data infra and give them access so they fix their mess when it happens ?Put myself on call time to time hoping I caught most of the outside working hours errors ?Insist to not deploy new features (schema changes) over the weekend ?For now I am considering asking for time compensation on case I had to work over the weekend to fix things, but not sure if this is viable on long term, especially as it's not on my contract.Thanks for your insight.",

        "author": "lancejpollard",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "General problem I'm been considering in the back of my head, when trying to figure out how to make some sort of interactive web UI for various language texts, and allow text annotation, and text editing (to progressively/slowly clean up the text mistakes over time, etc.). But in a way such a way that, if you or someone edits the text down the road, it won't mess up the annotations and stuff like that?I don't know much about linguistic annotation software (saw [this brief overview of some options](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/text-annotation-labeling-tools/#1-labellerr)), but what I've looked at so far are basically these:- [Perseus Greek Texts](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0227) (click on individual words to lookup)- [Prodigy demo](https://demo.prodi.gy/?=null&view_id=pos_manual) (on of the text annotation tools I could quickly try in basic mode for free)- [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/articulus) (double click to visit terms anywhere in the text)But the general problem I'm getting stuck on in my head is what I was saying, here is a brief example to clarify:- Say we are working with the Bible text (bunch of books, divided into chapters, divided into verses)- The data model I'm considering at this point is a tree of JSON basically, `text_section` can be arbitrarily nested (bible -> book -> chapter), and then at the end are `text_span` in the children (verses here).- Say the Bible unicode text is super messy, random artifacts here and there, extra whitespace and punctuation in various spots, overall the text is 90% good quality but could use months or years of fine-tuned polish to clean it up and make it perfect. (Sefaria texts, open-source Hebrew texts, are super-super messy, tons of textual artifacts that could use some love to clean up and stuff eventually over time... for example.).- But say you can also annotate the text at any point, creating probably \"selection_ranges\" of text within or across verses, etc.. Then you can label or do whatever to add metadata to those ranges.Problem is:- Text is being cleaned up over say a couple years, a few minor tweaks every day.- Annotations are being added every day too.Edge-case is basically this:- Annotation is added on some selected text- Text gets edited (maybe user is not even aware of or focused on the annotation UI at this point, but under the hood the metadata is still there).- Editor removes some extra whitespace, and adds a missing word (as they found say by looking at a real manuscript scan).- Say the editor added `Newton` to `Isaac`, so whereas before it said `foo bar Isaac ... baz`, now it says `foo bar Isaac Newton baz`.- Now the annotation sort of changes meaning, and needs to be redone (this is a terrible example, I tried thinking of what my mind's stumbling on, but can't quite pin it down totally yet).- Should say `foo bar Isaac Newton baz` let's say (but the editor never sees anything annotation-wise...)Basically, trying to show that, the annotations can get messed up, and I don't see a systematic way to handle or resolve that if editing the text is also allowed.You can imagine other cases where some annotation marks like a phrase or idiom, but then the editor comes and changes the idiom to be something totally different, or just partially different, whatever. Or splits the annotation somehow, etc..Basically, have apps or anyone figured out generally how to handle this general problem? How to not make it so when you edit, you have to just delete the annotations, but it somehow smart merges, or flags it for double-checking, etc.. Basically there is a lot to think through functionality-wise, and I'm not sure if it's already been done before. It's both a data-modeling problem, and a UI/UX problem. But mainly concerned about the technical data-modeling problem here.",

The issue I am facing is since the query result is large, I am running out of memory. I tried using `--quick` command with `mysql` client to get the data row wise, instead of all at once, but I did not notice any improvement. On average, 1 Million rows seem to be taking 1GB in this case.My idea is to stream the query result data from the Mysql DB Server to my Script and then once it hits some number of rows, I gzip and send the data to S3. I do this multiple times until I am through my complete result. I am looking to avoid the limit/offset query route since the dataset is fairly large and limit/offset will just move the issue to DB Server memory.Is there any way to do this in bash itself or it would be better to move to Python/R or some other language? I am open to any kind of tools, since I want to revamp this, so that this can handle atleast 50-100 million scale.Thanks in advance",

The tricky part: there’s no change tracking, so right now any update means a full re-ingestion.Stack-wise, we’re on AWS, using Qdrant for the vector store, Temporal for workflow orchestration, and Terraform for IaC. Down the line, we’ll also build a data lake, so I’m trying to keep the chatbot infra modular and future-proof.My current idea: API → S3 (raw) → chunk + embed → upsert into Qdrant. Temporal would handle orchestration.I’m debating whether I should spin up a separate metadata DB (like DynamoDB) to track ingestion state, chunk versions, and file progress or just rely on Qdrant payload metadata for now.If you’ve built RAG systems or large-scale vector pipelines:* How did you handle re-ingestion when delta updates weren’t available?* Is maintaining a metadata DB worth it early on?* Any lessons learned or “wish I’d done this differently” moments?Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.

        "author": "Remote_Impact_8173",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!Assume I got a huge dataset of crawled internet webpages, and I'd like to transform them page by page doing some kind of filtration, pre-processing, tokenization etc. Let's say that original dataset is stored along some metainformation in form of parquet files in S3.Coming from enterprises, I have some background in Apache ecosystem as well as some older Big Tech MapReduce-kinda data warehouses, so my first idea was to use Spark to define those transformations using some scala/python code and just deal with it in batch processing manner. But before doing it \"classic ETL-style\" way, I decided to check some more modern (trending?) data stacks that are out there.I learned about Modal. They seem to be claiming about revolutionizing data processing, but I am not sure how exactly the practical usecases of data processing are expressed in them. Therefore, a bunch of questions to the community:1. They don't provide a notion of \"dataframes\", nor know anything about my input datasets, thus I must be responsible for somehow partitioning of the input into chunks, right? Like, reading slices of parquet file if needed, or coalescing groups of parquet files together before running an actual distributed computation?2. What about fault-tolerance? Spark has implemented protocols for atomic output commit, how do you expose result of a distributed data processing atomically without producing garbage from restarted jobs when using Modal? Do I, again, implement this manually?3. Is there any kind of long-running data processing operation state snapshotting? (not saying about individual executors, but rather the application master) If I have a CPU intensive computation running for 24 hours and I close my laptop lid, or the initiator host dies some other way, am I automatically screwed?4. Are there tweaks like speculative execution, or at least a way how to control/abort individual function executions? It is always a pity to see how 99% of a job finished with high concurrency and last couple of tasks ended up on some faulty host and take eternity to finish. 5. Since they are a cloud service - do you know about their actual scalability limits? I have a computation CPU cluster of \\~25k CPU cores in my company, do they have some comparable fleet? It would be quite stupid to hit into some limitation like \"no more than 1000 cpu cores per user unless you are an enterprise folk paying $20k/month just for a license\"... 6. Also, them being non-opensource also makes it harder to understand what exactly happens under the hood, are there any open-source competitors to them? Or at least a way how to bring them on-premise to my company's fleet?And a more generic question – has any of you folks ever tried actually processing some huge datasets with them? Right now it looks more like a tool for smaller developer experiments, or for time-slicing GPUs for seconds, but not something that I would use to build a reliable data pipeline over. But maybe I am missing something. PS I was told Ray also became popular recently, and they seem to be open-source as well, so will check them later as well.",

        "author": "ApacheDoris",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In large-scale data analytics, balancing speed, flexibility, and accuracy is always a challenge. Apache Flink and Apache Doris together provide a strong foundation for real-time analytics pipelines. Flink offers powerful stream processing capabilities, while Doris provides low-latency analytics over large datasets.This post outlines the main integration patterns between the two systems, focusing on the **Flink Doris Connector** and **Flink CDC** for end-to-end real-time ETL.# 1. Overview: Flink + Doris in Real-time Analytics**Apache Flink** is a distributed stream processing engine widely adopted for ingesting and processing data from various sources such as databases, message queues, and event streams.**Apache Doris** is an MPP-based real-time analytical database that supports fast, high-concurrency queries. Its architecture includes:* **FE (Frontend):** request routing, query parsing, metadata, scheduling* **BE (Backend):** query execution and data storageTogether, Flink and Doris form a complete path: **Data Collection → Stream Processing → Real-time Storage → Analytics and Query**https://preview.redd.it/g5xktumi95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=58bff724160508aa3b65d27668013b2451af496c# 2. Flink Doris Connector: Scan, Lookup Join, and Real-time WriteThe **Flink Doris Connector** provides three major functions for building data pipelines.# (1) Scan (Reading from Doris)Instead of using a traditional JDBC connector (which can hit throughput limits), the Doris Source in Flink distributes read requests across Doris backend nodes.* The Flink JobManager requests a query plan from Doris FE.* The plan is distributed to TaskManagers, each reading data directly from assigned Tablets in parallel.This distributed approach significantly increases data read throughput during synchronization or batch analysis.https://preview.redd.it/nm11w5nm95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de75abee5e481cc1816edb4f5a794450eaf78e1# (2) Lookup Join (Real-time Stream + Dimension Table Join)Flink supports joining streaming data with dimension tables in Doris.* **Traditional JDBC Lookup** performs synchronous single-record queries, which can easily become a bottleneck under heavy load.* **Flink Doris Connector** introduces **asynchronous batch lookups**: * Incoming events are queued and processed in batches. * Each batch is sent as a single `UNION ALL` query to Doris.This design improves join throughput and reduces latency in stream–dimension table lookups.https://preview.redd.it/g3xrn78p95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9b83137da211f91dde0ad32c19c003b8acbe03(3) Real-time Write (Sink)For real-time ingestion, the Connector uses Doris’s **Stream Load** mechanism.**Process summary:*** Sink initiates a long-lived Stream Load request.* Data is continuously sent in chunks during Flink checkpoints.* After a checkpoint is completed, the transaction is committed and becomes visible in Doris.https://preview.redd.it/w5d7rmut95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4c308903f6902c398ebd4b0f152fbcb4aac98aTo ensure **exactly-once semantics**, the connector uses a **two-phase commit**:1. Pre-commit data during checkpoint (not yet visible)2. Commit after checkpoint successhttps://preview.redd.it/m1nwzo2w95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fa327670b871eb62744b05a96fc454ef2d2c1**Balancing real-time and exactly-once:** Because commits depend on Flink checkpoints, shorter checkpoint intervals yield lower latency but higher resource use. The Connector adds a **batch caching mechanism**, temporarily buffering records in memory before committing, which improves throughput while maintaining correctness (idempotent writes under Doris primary key model).https://preview.redd.it/lattav7x95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=26943c7358c98e9dc2dcd0076861d23f80083524# 3. Flink CDC: Full and Incremental Synchronization**Flink CDC (Change Data Capture)** supports both initial full synchronization and continuous incremental updates from databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.# (1) Common challenges in full sync:* Detecting and syncing new tables automatically* Handling metadata and type mapping* Supporting DDL propagation (schema changes)* Low-code setup with minimal configuration# (2) Flink CDC capabilities:* **Incremental snapshot reading** with parallelism and lock-free scanning* **Restartable sync** — if interrupted, the task continues from the last offset* **Broad source support** (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)https://preview.redd.it/6564nl0z95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=93dbfd850c5765db605dd97613c1dc9a3f42e64a# (3) One-click integration with DorisWhen combined with the Flink Doris Connector, the system can automatically:* Create downstream Doris tables if they don’t exist* Route multiple tables to different sinks* Manage schema mapping transparentlyThis reduces configuration complexity and speeds up deployment for large-scale data migration and sync jobs.# 4. Schema Evolution with Light Schema ChangeDoris recently added a **Light Schema Change** mechanism that enables millisecond-level schema updates (add/drop columns) without interrupting ingestion or queries.When integrated with Flink CDC:1. The Source captures upstream DDL operations.2. The Doris Sink parses and applies them via Light Schema Change.Compared to traditional methods, schema change latency dropped from over 1 second to a few milliseconds, allowing continuous sync even during frequent schema evolution.# 5. Example: Full MySQL Database SynchronizationA full sync job can be submitted via the Flink client, defining:* Flink configurations (parallelism, checkpoint interval)* Table filtering via regex* Source/Sink connector parametersThis setup allows syncing entire databases to Doris with minimal configuration effort.https://preview.redd.it/8o0fii32a5vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0960520b54b0432925a13584963929566966db2b# 6. Summary**Key takeaways:*** **Flink Doris Connector** supports parallel reading, async lookup joins, and exactly-once real-time writing.* **Flink CDC** provides lock-free incremental sync, automatic table creation, and DDL propagation.* **Light Schema Change** in Doris enables near-instant schema updates with no downtime.The combination of Flink and Doris offers a practical, open-source approach to real-time data integration and analytics at scale.",

I’d follow youtube tutorials line by line, everything worked and I’d feel smart for five minutes until I tried writing something on my own and realized I didn’t understand any of it. Last week I decided to rebuild a small project from scratch, a simple weather app I made months ago. It took longer, broke constantly and at one point I almost gave up but when it finally ran I actually understood what was happening this time. That moment felt different. I switched tabs on my laptop, leaned back and played a game on myprize. If you’re stuck in tutorial hell, rebuild something from memory. It’s not easy but it’s the first time coding has felt real to me.",

        "content": "Hi, I 17F is a first year computer science student and I’m currently learning C as my first language in an academic setting. Other languages I have played around with are python, css, html and javascript. I wouldn’t say I have a strong foundation in any of these languages but I’ve dabbled a bit in them. I’m pointing out my coding/programming background to show I barely have any knowledge, when I was learning those languages I barely had any projects except when I was learning html and css in which I posted very beginner like web pages, task bars etc. I really don’t want to get dependent on AI due to the fact on different subreddits I see people say they hire swe’s or software developers and they aren’t able to code at all, I don’t want that to be me, even though AI has been around for a while now I want to act like it’s still 2010s-2020 when people were learning how to code without the use of tools like that, another reason is that my degree is more tailored to practical and applied programming than it is to theory and mathematics, towards my second semester of first year and second year I’ll be doing less of mathematics & computer science theory and more of Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Object Oriented programming, Databases. I don’t want to GPT my way through this degree, I want to know why and how things work, I want to be able to actually critically think and problem solve, I’m not saying people who use AI cannot do this, I’ve heard several senior developers implement these tools in their day to day activities, but I’m saying as a beginner with a foundation which is not so sturdy, if I do rely on AI as a tool or teacher, I might get too dependent on it maybe that’s just a skill issue on my end :grinning_face_with_sweat:. I noticed C is a bit different from these languages cause C is more backend language and is used for compiling, I wouldn’t say it’s a hard language to learn but it’s definitely tricky for me, I don’t really want to use AI to learn it, apart from W3Schools and Youtube videos which other resources like books, blogs, websites can I use to learn this language?",

        "content": "It's actually very good. I really enjoy how they make programming and computer science seem fun and simple, the professor is very good at explaining concepts no matter how difficult or unfamiliar they are. Things like memory management in C or data structures and algorithms were very easily explained, David Malan (the professor) is a very energetic and enthusiastic teacher but he explains his thoughts very clearly, he does a very good job at explaining these concepts visually and conceptually. Things that I was scared of getting stuck on became very simple once they were explained, David Malan is a very good teacher.I also really enjoyed the problem sets. They were very well made and thought out, they're not too easy like some of the other coding courses that say things like \"print hello world\", \"create a variable and print it\", no with CS50 every problem set is a mini-project(s). It's not too hand-holding like other courses where it feels like you're following instructions instead of building, no you get an explanation, you get a demo of how the final product should look, sometimes you get a short walkthrough or some hints, but at the end of the day it's all about you seeking the answer yourself and working through the problem. Some problem sets are unique and fun like I really enjoyed Fiftyville and Readability.Expanding on the last point, I really like how they focus on the problem solving aspect of programming. As a developer you don't get paid to code but to solve problems. I really enjoyed how they didn't encourage AI to write code or to be the main source of learning, no they really want you to read documentation, research and do rubber duck debugging, they encourage figuring things out yourself and that is such an important skill to learn.Another thing I enjoyed was how easy their tools were to use. Just make a Github account and connect it to the CS50 codespace. They document and explain their tools like submit50 and check50 very well. I think that if tomorrow you start CS50 and it's your first day programming, it would be very straightforward to get started with the CS50 tools.Now, the course isn't particularly easy, simple and easy aren't the same thing. If you have no experience with computer science then CS50 could be a bit difficult at first since they get you up and running QUICK, I mean they start talking about algorithms and memory management by around week 3 and 4 and so yeah this is definitely not a course that I would say is \"easy\", but the professor is very good at explaining concepts and if you just stay consistent and you keep going it'll be worth it. It actually gets easier from week 6 and onwards, in my opinion.Overall, it's a great course. Heck, I wouldn't even be mad if this course costed money. If you're thinking of taking an easy to follow, free, fun course full of learning opportunities then I think CS50 is great, there is not really much of anything that I disliked, everything was super straight forward and simple.",

        "content": "I am studying Computer science. I started in 2023 and am currently going through a course in data structures. I am having some hiccups in my development in the field. My first problem is that I feel a bit too old to just be starting to get my degree (I am 25yo right now) and feel behind most of my peers. The other thing, and perhaps the most technical one, is that I don't feel adequate.I try not to compare myself to other since doing so only seems to make feel worse. Thus, I try to compare with my past self. When doing so, I can see some real improvement (to put an example last year I was not comfortable AT ALL programing 2D arrays during my structured programming course, today I can code some programs using 3D arrays using pointers), nevertheless every now and then I come across a problem that really test me while not being overly complicated and really begin doubting my own abilities (the most recent was writing a program to calculate, using pointers, an Adjugate matrix of an user-input 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 matrix).I do my best not to rely on AI, I always work my code as far as I can on my own using stackOverflow (or similar) to look things up that I don't remember, and, if I do end up using AI, I make sure to be 100% sure of what each part of the code I used its help for does and how it works in conjunction with the rest of the code, so the next time I need to do something similar, I can do it myself.I **think** I like programming, it can be frustrating, it can be confusing, but ultimately seeing my work **do** something makes me feel proud, unfortunately that doesn't necessarily translate in getting a decent job to be able to support myself. I hear about projects that other people work on and cant see myself doing such complex tasks. This in conjunction of being in a whole different age bracket that most classmates, makes me doubt if I even have a future in this field (I am calculating, based on my missing courses, to be finishing by the time I am between 27 and 29 yo). Of course, I am already trying to see what I need to get a job while studying.Basically, I sometimes feel like I am learning, and others feels like I learned nothing at all, and being older as other freshmen/sophomores put me down a little bitDoes anyone that currently working in the field felt, or feel, like this? How did you get over it? If anyone reading previously had another degree and went back to study CS, I would love to read their experience since that is the boat I am right now.",

So far I've invested in the following books hoping to give myself an edge:1. Designing Data-Intensive Applications (to help understand designing for scale)2. The Creative Programmer (to better understand the problem solving process)3. Concurrency in Go4. Learning Go (Go is my favorite language to work in, so I want to learn it deeply)5.

However i know there is lots of us in this field and im just absolutely curious partially for my own benefit and for others. For those ADHD students like me who are in the beginning stages of learning entry level programming for school, what was it that engaged you in learning to program? I've heard all kinds of like use 'x' platform, code a project, watch tutorials, or something similar. But I'm not really sure where is the proper starting point, where to go to learn properly, or what kind of project to even start with if that is even the right course of action. I do thrive on structured, self paced interactive learning, but i always feel like something like codecademy is just making me write code but not even really applying it to anything. Learning theory doesn't really work for me, and while i know codecademy isn't really theory it feels kinda similar, just write random little things and then go make a big thing then forget it all pretty much when you finish and when you go to actually make something the best i can do is print a math equation or text. I'm also in school for Comp Sci and even that feels kinda the same. I really do enjoy this but knowing where to go and learn and sticking to it and having it work for me has been a real struggle. I do see a lot of others who are like me that are thriving and building things and know the syntax like its written on the back of their hands. So to reiterate the question, what was it that worked for you guys and what made you stick with it?",

Separating each class into a .h and a .cpp file.2. Using forward declarations in headers instead of including other headers whenever possible.3. Including the real headers only in the .cpp files where the functions are actually implemented.After doing this, all the circular include problems disappeared and everything compiled without errors.I know this might be obvious to experienced devs, but as a beginner, it was a big “aha” moment.If anyone has tips on structuring bigger C++ projects, I’d love to hear them.",

The most fun I had with programming was when I was studying data structures and algorithms because there I felt I didn't have to worry about the 'other stuff' to make the script work, just pure coding. I just love the syntax and the logic behind programming but I feel it is not enough for the future where I would like to score some job. Is this weird?

How can I keep good practises up, and how should I actually start building the application without it eventually crashing out on me.

        "content": "I am trying to make a function that assigns note names to musical scales which are represented by binary numbers. For example, the expected output for a scale 1001011100101 with a root of F would be F Ab Bb B C Eb F (for musical theory reasons).To do this I wrote a recursive function that attempts different scale spellings and returns the one with the lowest cost (e.g. F G# G## Bb Cb C C### F should have a higher cost). However I'm struggling with the recursion as its assigning unexpected costs to certain notes.Specifically at the calculate cost section (line 41). The function returns \\[('F', 0), ('Ab', 0), ('Bb', 0), ('Cb', 0), ('Dbb', 3), ('Eb', 0), ('F', 0)\\]). However I'm not sure why Cb has a cost of 0 and Dbb has a cost of 3. I would like them to be B and C which should have lower costs than Cb and Dbb.The idea behind the helper functions NameScalesEnharmonicRoots and NameScalesKeySignatures are to try different enharmonic roots (e.g. F# and Gb) for a scale and return the one with the lowest cost and to try to fit scales to key signatures to try to be accurate with music theory.Are there any recursion gurus who can help me out?Here is my code: def NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode): keys = ['C','C#','Db','D','D#','Eb','E','F','F#','Gb','G','G#','Ab','A','A#','Bb','B'] # get the pitches of the scale pitches = [] for i in range(len(binary)): if binary[i]=='1': pitches.append(i) # get the pitches of the major scale if 'b' in tonic: diatonic = [1] elif '#' in tonic: diatonic = [-1] else: diatonic = [0] for i in range(7): if (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('E') or (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('B'): diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+1) else: diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+2) def AssignNotes(pitch, letter, lastNote=''): # base case if pitch == len(pitches): if lastNote and lastNote in keys: return (0,'', []) return (float('inf'), '', []) if (letter > 7): return (float('inf'), '', []) # get the note currentLetterNum = (ord(tonic[0])+letter-65)%7+65 accidentals = pitches[pitch]-diatonic[letter] if accidentals == 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) elif accidentals < 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + 'b'*(-accidentals) elif accidentals > 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + '#'*accidentals # calculate cost if note in majorMode: totalCost = 0 else: totalCost = abs(accidentals)+1 totalStr = note totalList = [(note,totalCost)] if pitch == len(pitches)-1: currentLastNote = note else: currentLastNote = lastNote # recursive calls nextCost, nextStr, nextList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter+1,currentLastNote) totalCost += nextCost if nextStr != '': totalStr = note + '&ensp;' + nextStr totalList += nextList skipCost, skipStr, skipList = AssignNotes(pitch,letter+1,lastNote) doubleUpCost, doubleUpStr, doubleUpList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter,currentLastNote) if doubleUpCost != float('inf'): doubleUpCost += totalCost + abs(accidentals) + 1 if doubleUpStr != '': doubleUpStr = note + '&ensp;' +doubleUpStr doubleUpList = [(note,totalCost)]+doubleUpList # choose the path with the minimum cost minCost = min(totalCost,skipCost,doubleUpCost) if minCost == totalCost: return (totalCost, totalStr,totalList) elif minCost == skipCost: return (skipCost,skipStr,skipList) elif minCost == doubleUpCost: return (doubleUpCost,doubleUpStr,doubleUpList) return AssignNotes(0,0,'') # get the parent mode def NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary): orderOfSharps = ['F#','C#','G#','D#','A#','E#'] orderOfFlats = ['Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb','Cb'] flatKeys = ['C','F','Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb'] sharpKeys = ['C','G','D','A','E','B','F#','C#','G#','D#','A#'] lowestScale = None lowestCost = 9999999999999 for i in range(-5,2): if tonic in sharpKeys: accidentals = sharpKeys.index(tonic)+i elif tonic in flatKeys: accidentals = -flatKeys.index(tonic)+i if accidentals > 0: keySignature = orderOfSharps[:accidentals] elif accidentals < 0: keySignature = orderOfFlats[:abs(accidentals)] else: keySignature = [] # build the notes of the scale by character number and then add sharps and flats to them as they appear in the key signature majorMode = [] for j in range(7): letter = chr((ord(tonic[0])+j-65)%7+65) for k in keySignature: if letter in k: letter = k majorMode.append(letter) currentScale = NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode) if currentScale[0] < lowestCost: lowestCost = currentScale[0] lowestScale = currentScale print(majorMode) print(lowestScale) return lowestScale # get the tonic def NameScalesEnharmonicRoots(tonic,binary): enharmonics = [['C',''], ['F',''], ['Bb','A#'], ['Eb','D#'], ['Ab','G#'], ['Db','C#'], ['Gb','F#'], ['B',''], ['E',''], ['A',''], ['D',''], ['G','']] print(tonic,binary) scale = NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary) scaleNotes = scale[1] scaleKey = tonic for keys in enharmonics: if tonic in keys: enharmonic = keys[:] enharmonic.remove(tonic) enharmonicTonic = enharmonic[0] if enharmonicTonic: scaleEnharmonic = NameScalesKeySignatures(enharmonicTonic,binary) if scaleEnharmonic[0] < scale[0]: scaleNotes = scaleEnharmonic[1] scaleKey = enharmonicTonic return (scaleKey,scaleNotes) print(NameScalesEnharmonicRoots('F','1001011100101'))",

        "content": "I was just wondering about this today and wanted to know if I could find out the answer! One of the first reasons against it that came to mind is that it would be more difficult to determine if text data is actually text data or not, because text digits are represented in memory as their numerical values.However, isn't most data in computers stored as binary anyway? And it's really just a matter of what format and data type \"lens\" you want to view the data as?Having the characters 0-9 be their digit counterparts would make it easier to convert from text to numbers (granted, it isn't really that much harder now, because you just have to subtract a fixed offset from the character).Another reason I think they didn't take this route is that they wanted the NULL character to be represented by 0, which would slightly ruin the \"0-9 chars as 0-9 digits\" format, but couldn't they still make it work for 1-9?It really does just feel kind of non-intuitive to me why they chose to have digit characters not represented by their digits. What am I missing?Anyway, I'm excited to read your answers, and thanks in advance!",

I grew up with the Sinclair Speccy so have some grounding in (BASIC) coding concepts, and I spent some time learning JS earlier this year, coming at it from a very low knowledge level. I really enjoyed its accessibility and immediacy, but found the best online tuition sites (FreeCodeCamp etc) to be much too web dev focussed to hold my interest (totally appreciate JS is used predominanty for web).I've played a lot with UE4 and UE5 but always got hamstrung in the end with not knowing enough of the fundamentals to progress past a certain point - Blueprints is great, but without understanding what's going on processually, I found I got stuck quite early on with the complexities of the engine. So I want to jump into the deep end, and start learning C++, to get a proper deep level coding knowledge base.However... I want to find a way to learn that will give me some progressively more difficult, game based, coding projects along the way. I found the LearnC++ site which is absolutely awesome, but much too text heavy for me (I have ADHD/dyslexia) so want to find a balance between text and practice based learning.Can anyone point me to any relevant (and free/cheap) resources please, ones that will take me through the concepts progressively like LearnC++ does? Thank you!",

I have a low resource laptop running xubuntu.What I want to do is simulate 2 other pcs as if the were real and I can network to them and pull data. My goal is to use my laptop as a control node for a simulated network for practice in setting up networks, ssh, system monitoring, Python or bash scripting and automation tasks.I am learning to code/script in python and bash and wanted an interesting applicable project that will help me learn. I know of vm and I know podman/docker. I have not used either at this stage. But want some lightweight solution to be able to get a close approximation of real life set up. These were two options that I have found that may be able to provide what I need with some other steps for setting them up. Is there something that exists that achieves this already or should I set up scripts which generate data within a container or vm, I simply don't know if this is the right way to approach it. Thanks for the help. Edit: I have learned that spoofing hardware is what I am aiming to do. Simulate is apparently the wrong word. I will either use vm or potentially my antix usb on my other laptop. And then spoof hardware. With whatever a hypervisor is. So I have more work to do here.This is awesome.",

I completed the introductory “Hello World”, and other starter programs that they suggested however, I started doing extra exercises to attempt to help myself. I know with coding, like any hobby, you need experience and just working out new problems helps. When I’d ask for help or an explanation it feels as if the programmer mentors are frustrated with me because they cannot dumb down the material enough. Luckily I have a friend that’s been helping me explain code verbally and it’s helping more than sitting on scratch for 5 hours ever has but I still feel like I’m missing something. Basic functions are hard to write and I know memorization isn’t really your friend in this subject so how exactly do you know what to code? I feel like I’m constantly copying-pasting and trying new things to get certain examples to work correctly. Is this wrong? Should I be approaching this another way?",

I end up re learning basics but then have no idea how to move forward or what to do that would genuinely help me learn the complexities of coding used in such automation. Btw automation can be like generating a list of pin names for input and output of a design once i feed it through an excel file for example....Thanks for reading and appreciate any possible solutions",

I started with a small course on a webpage to then do a 2 years associate degree in computer programming (don't really know the USA equivalent) and now i'm finishing my first year as a computer engineer. The big problem is i go to classes at morning, so this semester i have been only working at evening and on weekends, and can't really make big advancements on projects. Besides that because of my time here and my expertise i have become really important in the company.My boss told me this week that i need to start being more present and wants me to kinda leave university so that he can assign me on more projects. Which is great, but i wanna become a professional with an engineer degree so that i can have a better future (or at least on paper).My family is doing better thanks to me having this job and me paying almost all my stuff and helping around in the house, so me quitting this job will affect economically both me and my parents. And my boss doesn't wanna have me as a freelancer because i have become really valuable for him.My university is not actively trying to open classes at night so that is a problem, and choosing another university will take me time and wont be as close as the one i'm currently at.I haven't talked to my parents about this so i don't know if they are capable of helping me while looking for another job that will meet my criteria.So i don't really know what to do because this is a complex situation for me",

I can have 2 hours/day for this. I started The Odin Project few years ago and I stopped at the beginning asynchronous Javascript.

Are there any videos or classes anywhere that have more of a vocabulary-based guide perhaps? I tend to visualize the spelling of words when spoken to me, so I think it can work. For example I imagine the audio would say something like: if you want to start a new paragraph, then you would type “less than symbol, P, and then greater then symbol” So it would be extremely annoying to learn visually for those of us wanting to learn via typing alongside the teacher. But for those rare few of us who’d like to get the ball rolling during a mind-numbing, dead end job by listening, it could be quite useful.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,So a few months back I got an internship for fullstack development.Initially, I was told I'd be mentored and get resources and experience a professional environment and learn from seniors.I immediately got thrown into projects with deadlines at the end of the week. I didn't really mind this but I have been thrown around from project to project without any being completed, I haven't had any resources.My main concerns are the following:* Not a single project has any form of docs whatsoever and this is something I wanted to learn about* I don't have a mentor* I don't even work with a senior* I don't even have my code reviewed* I work with a couple other juniors, whom don't work with the seniors either, and one heavily relies on AI so much that his code is always buggy and he doesn't know how to fix it* The director constantly uses AI to add code and pushes it to the main branch.* We only ever use one stack, which is redwoodjs, for every single project, or react native, expo if it's for mobile. No other tech stacks regardless of what the project is. Example of when this irked me a little, this last week I had to implement AI into one of the projects to read and automate docs. I wanted to use OCR, and felt like having a simple fastAPI server would've been beneficial as there are many great python packages to handle exactly what I needed but I was told to do so with react, of which packages to handle pdfs were hard to come by and many didn't support OCR from pdfs on react. It would also be nice to use other stacks and see where they benefit.I have tried other companies but I don't have a degree and every response I get is that I either need a degree or a few years of professional experience and I honestly don't believe that I'm getting that kind of experience with my internship",

Okay, fine whatever. Then came the \"vibe coding\" initiative. As if we don't have enough inexperience on our teams due to constant layoffs, we're now actively encouraging people to make mistakes and trust AI for the sake of speed. Healthcare company by the way (yikes).What happened to actually knowing things? When will people realize AI is frequently, confidently wrong? I feel like an insane person shouting on every company survey and in every town hall meeting to get these AI-pilled people to understand the damage they are doing. We have people introducing double-digit numbers of defects on single user stories now, and those people don't get in trouble (meanwhile I'm a bad person because I didn't talk to AI last week, for shame!). I have been applying to dozens of jobs, but every job I apply to is now a game of appeasing an AI reading my application. Of course the market just being crummy in general at the moment doesn't help. Most of the job postings are in developing AI tools that won't be around a year or two from now when they inevitably flop. I'm sure there are companies out there that aren't buying into the AI hype or are just too small to necessitate them, but they seem few and far between.I'm realizing I have such an appreciation for the critical thinking and problem solving aspects of the career, but as it changes I'm falling out of love with what it is becoming.

At this time, the Fed finally decided to reverse their take on inflation being only transitory, and began their first rate hike to begin cooling the economy in an attempt to suppress rising inflation. Corporations responded to this shift in monetary policy and began immediately reducing their hiring and thus job postings. Over the course of the year, SWE job postings fell rapidly.In November of 2022, ChatGPT was widely released. Following that, other models by other companies were widely released. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following ChatGPTs release. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following other model releases. In fact, the declining rate of job postings slowed as the Fed reduce their rate of interest rate hikes. The number of SWE job postings is not materially different now than it was the day that CoPilot and Gemini released.I am asserting that the CS job market today is almost entirely a product of the normal labor market effects during a Federal Funds Interest Rate hike cycle. The layoffs we see today are still a hold over from the massive hiring effort made post-pandemic compounded by corporations now being squeezed due to comparatively speaking high interest rates.Largely, not completely, any company that conducts layoffs citing AI are doing so as a PR play as it makes it sound as though they are able to the same work with less overhead and are expertly adopting this new technology, when in reality they are just responding to the squeeze. Any job seeker unable to find a job and citing reasons due to AI are doing so because it protects their ego or they are uninformed about the greater monetary policy and labor market effects at play.",

I've been working at a FAANG for a bit over eight years, and got promoted to Senior around three years ago.I recently went on a job search, and things went very well for me. I spent several months (April to July) preparing, did a bunch of mock interviews, solved hundreds of LeetCode questions, etc. That dedicated prep was absolutely vital. While my experience helped me get interviews, the prep work was what allowed me to pass interviews. If I had just started applying without putting the prep work in, I probably would have gotten around the same number of responses, but I would not have been nearly as successful once I got to the interviews themselves. I applied to most of these companies over the last week of July, and ultimately signed a deal with a household name tech company as a Staff Engineer in early October.I really feel for all the new grads out there - when I was applying, I quickly realized I didn't need to filter the job listings by experience, because basically every company had almost exclusively Senior and above roles - there were barely any new grad or even just early career listings that I could see. It definitely looks like it's a tough market for new engineers, but (in my experience, which isn't saying it'll be true for everyone) the market for Senior and Staff seems relatively robust.Happy to answer any questions. I also answered some questions about my experience in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1o38ecf/comment/nitin7d/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1o38ecf/comment/nitin7d/)",

We used to have fun discussions, laugh, share personal stuff I genuinely thought we were close. But after I got laid off, it was like I never existed.I reached out to one person from my old team just to see how things were going there, and she completely ignored my message. That hit me harder than I expected. It made me feel so small, like I was begging for attention or validation when all I wanted was some human decency.I’m still early in my career, just a fresh grad, and this was my first real job. I was one of the top performers on the team too, so getting laid off and then being treated like that felt like a slap in the face.I know I’ll bounce back eventually, but man… this experience gave me a real taste of how cold things can get in the professional world.Has anyone else gone through something similar after being laid off?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a junior software engineer (9 months in) at a Series B cybersecurity startup with around 60 people.Honestly, my experience here has been kind of bizarre, and I’m wondering if this is a normal experience.I’m in a small team that reports directly to the CEO: one senior engineer, me, and an intern. The CEO is technically our manager, but he’s basically a ghost. He gives no technical direction or help. When I ask for guidance, he just says, “Ask other engineers,” but they’re in completely different departments and have no idea what I’m working on. So we all just work in isolation on our own little projects. There’s no code review, no real communication, and QA is all manual.The CEO keeps saying that since we’re a small team, we have to be “extra vigilant” and document everything — but that’s about the extent of his input. The funny part is, on the rare occasions when he does try to manage us, he becomes super micromanagey, nitpicking tiny details and trying to control everything. It’s weird because 95% of the time he’s totally absent, and then suddenly he swings to the complete opposite extreme. Some days I literally have nothing to do because he doesn’t assign new tasks.There are times when I get completely blocked because I don’t have the resources or information I need. When I mentioned that to the CEO, he told me that I was “blaming others” and that I should be more proactive. There was also this one time during our monthly progress meeting when our senior engineer fell behind on something because she was waiting for an API from another department. The CEO got frustrated and the two started arguing each other for a good minute or so about it.My biggest concern is this: Most of the projects I’ve done are small — maybe 2,000 to 3,000 lines of code at most. They feel more like college projects than production systems, and I’m not sure if they’re even worth putting on my resume. Sure, I have learned a few things here and there — Docker/K8s, Nginx with PM2, VM provisioning, shell scripting, a bit of frontend deployment but I’m worried that I’m not getting enough solid experience to grow. I’ve been studying 2–3 hours every night and 5 hours on weekends just to make sure I don’t fall behind.Is this kind of situation normal for early-career engineers at startups?",

Passed their tech interview and I got an offer, but the main hangup is the salary. They will likely not offer me any more than I'm already making. So I'm weighing between my current 2 choices, with their own pros and cons. Company A (Current company)- Currently making $115k. They've been decent about raises so far, so I'd expect to reach 120-125 within a year. - Java + spring backend, angular frontend. We're a big company, so we have a lot of structure and systems setup. Docker + kubernetes, deployment pipelines, etc. I prefer this stack since it seems like most companies in my area use java + spring. - I like my current team and manager. No conflicts, we get along well, and my manager is a tech guy so he understands what I do and how to support me. - Benefits are pretty great, huge 401k match and a lot of PTO. - The main downside is it's 5 days in office. Yeah, it sucks. It's a 30 min commute so it's not as bad as some others, but it's not great when we used to be 2 days in office before. This is the reason I'm looking elsewhere. Company B (Who sent the offer)- .NET/C# backend, React frontend, and a lot of SQL (we don't use SQL at company A). Mostly Microsoft based tech stack. - Would probably offer me 115k, but unlikely to see raises afterwards. - 4 days remote, 1 day in office, and the office is 5 minutes away. This is by far the biggest benefit. - The team seems good, but they're super small. They're down to 2 devs, the tech lead and another mid level developer. No indication on if they'll hire more. - They're not a startup, but they're midsized. Not as structured as company A, but also nowhere near the same amount of red tape.

        "content": "This summer, I landed an internship at a company I’d always dreamed about. At the start, everything felt perfect the team was friendly, people would talk and engage. But as the weeks went by, I started seeing the reality. My mentor never seemed interested in genuinely solving my problems. Whenever I’d share updates or ask for help, she’d just avoid it or brush things off with random things. Major issues in my project were ignored by her, even though the entire team, including the manager, knew about these blockers. Because of this, I lost 3–4 weeks struggling with blockers while no one actually helped.Honestly, my communication wasn’t the best since this was my first job. I thought putting in hard work would be enough, but I soon realised it’s more about networking and “being seen.” Even so, I completed my project completely from start to finish, pushing thousands of lines of code in the last five days before my internship ended.After all that effort, I didn’t get a return offer. The HR gave me random feedback which wasn’t even related to my actual work. It was clear my mentor and manager had already made up their minds. She never gave me any feedback during the entire internship. Even after it ended, I reached out to her, but she just ignored my message. She’s only skilled at looking good in front of upper management.This whole experience has taken a major mental toll on me. Even now, months after rejection, I feel like a failure. Every time I open LeetCode or even see job openings from that company on LinkedIn, it messes with my mind. Most interns got converted to full-time, even those who barely worked meanwhile, I did everything right and still got left behind. I’d be labelled as a failure in front of other interns, the team, and even networks within the company man.Although I did get another offer, working at that company was my dream. That dream was completely destroyed because of these people. Whenever I try to talk about it, people just give me sympathy and say, “You’ll get better opportunities.” But they don’t realise life doesn’t throw big opportunities every day. It hurts even more because of how things turned out there. Sometimes I wish I had never interned at that place.",

        "content": "It's a tough market out there, and unfortunately it's also one of the easiest places for honest folks to get duped. Honestly, getting a \"noreply\" is better than having your information sold and being contacted for the hundredth time by some random sales associate (usually speaking broken English with a generic pitch).That brings me to the subreddit in question. The first post I came across was this one: [Software Engineer - HTML/CSS/JS @ Apple | $120K–$210K | Paid Relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit/comments/1o1dgrx/software_engineer_htmlcssjs_apple_120k210k_paid/)It struck me as incredibly generic and out of touch. I left a comment for future readers because the post felt vague — basic HTML/CSS/JS skills, sky-high compensation, and no real details on location, employment type, or expectations. Most legitimate job postings include more concrete requirements. When they don’t, that’s usually a red flag.Out of curiosity, I reached out to one of the mods, who also claims to be the creator of the sub. While the conversation was polite, almost every question I asked was either dodged or brushed off. From what I could gather, they're scraping job listings from various sources, rewriting them into more digestible formats, and then notifying the companies afterward.When I asked if they had any process to clean up expired or inactive roles, how the employers are notified, or if they could post the sources for these scraped jobs, the conversation was cut short. Shortly after, I received a permanent ban from the subreddit. That, to me, is a bad sign.I wasn’t planning to apply through them anyway. I highly doubt Apple is scanning Reddit for job applicants based on comments and quick pitches. But I do care that people might be getting taken advantage of without realizing it.The job market is already stressful enough. The least we can do is call out shady practices when we see them.**TL;DR:** The subreddit r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit posted a sketchy-looking Apple job with vague requirements and high pay. I asked the mod some basic questions about sourcing and expired listings, got vague answers, and was banned shortly after. Feels like they're scraping jobs and repackaging them with little transparency. Be cautious, this looks more like a traffic funnel than a legit job board adjacent.",

We are both very skeptical of AI in general and both have been developers for almost 20 years each, but after a weekend of working with it he seems to have seen the light to the productivity boost. I have hit or miss experiences with AI, but never used it to vibe code. He spoke to a Microsoft Azure rep and they mentioned that AI is great for vibe coding greenfield stuff, but it doesn't work as well with established code. He is now in the process of using AI to take an existing C# .Net 4.8 MVC application to Blazor using Telerik controls to see the viable of using it to churn out new features faster.From reading this sub and Twitter, there seems to be a period where vibe coding with AI seems like magic where it seems to do everything perfectly the first time until it doesn't. So my question is what are other people's experiences and if and when the tables turned and you settled on using it only when it makes sense? Has anyone had success using it with an established code base where UI is in one project, classes another and then another for services?",

I have experience with java and spring, databases (SQL and non-sql), event systems like rabbitmq/Kafka, rest/graphql, docker, kubernetes, maven/gradle. These are most of the things I do on a day to day basis. Throw in testing (junit, mockito, testcontainers) and observability/tracing tools like kibana/datadog/grafana.But when I apply to positions I am asked all of the above and way more. Most jobs are listed as full stack, so they require experience with angular/react. Then they want cloud experience, which is very vague imo. Do they expect you to set up ec2 instances and manage load balancers? They also want DevOps experience, but that doesn't stop at k8s/docker, throw in some helm, terraform, setup clusters from scratch if possible.At the end of the day most of these positions seem like 3 or 4 people into 1. They want a backend engineer, a frontend one, a DevOps and sometimes even a tester/IT/infra.And I know those are wishlists but while applying and interviewing, I actually get asked about all these things and even get denied if I don't have experience with them. Is this the new normal? Am I just not versatile enough? The project I work on does not allow me to have experience with all these other things things, and I want to know if you would expect someone to know all of these when working.And to specify: I'm not applying to startups where I understand its more expected to be a one man team.",

Eventually in a meeting with him, he snaps at me and tells me to “think!”. I was scared and confused. Keep in mind that I have Autism and severe anxiety. Usually, I get moved to a new project every sprint and have to deliver on time or else. I didn’t really have anyone available to help if I needed them, just a few minutes of explanation on a good day. I was hesitant since I began asking for ADA 6 months prior. I decided to call again and got my ADA approved for 60 days for Autism. I told my manager that I had ASD and would experience memory lapses under enough anxiety. He told me, “you can over come it.” He glanced at the paper explaining my condition and didn’t keep it. 5 days later he puts me on pip and detailing poor code quality. I was shocked. He himself approved those PRs and no one else found issue with it. When I requested pip papers, he gave it to me a month later without the pages of code he showed me. My anxiety skyrocketed to a point where I took extra days off and time to recover from. He never talked to me like the others in the office, and left me out of many team meetings. He puts me on one project where I had to do big data work when my strength was backend. The POC I needed to sign off my work kept changing the solutioning for the data and my ASD brain went into overdrive to make sure I could grasp it. That took 4 weeks. I was struggling with my mental health and updated my mid year a little late. My manager only based my mid year on those 4 weeks only. Shortly after I got very ill and lost a loved one in an accident. My manager told me to compartmentalize. Day 60 into the 90 pip, I ask him for more work since I’ve completed the recent work on time. He told me, “I’m working hard to find you work.” He moved our 1:1 meeting to 4:30. Once I show up to the meeting he said that I showed little improvement and had security escort me out the office. I never saw or heard from HR once. No severance, just out on the street. The ADA expired weeks ago and I was going to reapply once I saw my doctor again. I don’t know what I did wrong. I pushed myself past 100% trying to do as he asked. I compartmentalized and dedicated most of my free time to rest until work the next morning. What did I do wrong? He asked me to quit my black employee resource group, I skipped time with family, and put in an extra few hours on some days to ensure perfect code. I don’t know what I did to disappoint them. My mind would shutdown from exhaustion, but I was on medication to push me past 100%. I’m at home now recovering before I seek my next job. It was my first tech job out of college 2 YOE.",

I feel like I've quiet quit a while ago.Just coming back from vacation (the first in the last two years) and am fairly sure I'm about to be PIPed; not caused by my age, but I'm the oldest on the team and the other two oldest people were PIPed and removed a while back. I've been able to hold on with sheer grit.I wouldn't care about leaving the company, but I can't get a sense of what's next. I lack the confidence of the wildly talented and productive people that I tend to compare myself to (even on my own team). I did a bootcamp to get here and I think that my diversity of experience is a huge advantage for me.I sense that this is not an uncommon experience, but the macroeconomic moment feels terrifying and that lack of confidence is making me feel like I might have a difficult journey in landing a next role in the current environment.The thought of interviewing again feels almost as bad as staying in the current role, but I know that the only way out is through.Any advice for someone who is about to re-enter the market?",

After being a full time software dev for a fortune 500 company (not big tech) and making a little shy of 100k (65k take home) i have been struggling with personal finances. My mortgage and housing expenses is 40% of my budget, food is 20%, that doesn't leave much to even get ahead. I have a small 3 bed 1 bath in a poor neighborhood and I'm looking to move for a better school district and my budget is aimed at the worst houses in the market. My wife is disabled and a stay at home mom so I only have 1 income and I'm dealing with health issues myself that makes me not on top of my game.I studied hard 8 months last year for big tech jobs but when I went to apply I put in apps to all big tech companies I only got Amazon responding and I failed their initial screening due to it being a design problem rather than leetcode. Even tried applying to jobs that weren't big tech and don't get a call back.I could do a business or at least a micro saas for income but I have too much idea paralysis before starting. I could make anything with software and I make great full stack software but I don't have a GREAT idea for an undeserved market. I could specialize in a field in CS but I am a .NET/go dev with some full stack experience. I could go to a different field like cyber sec or data engineering but I don't know a good list of ones that pay more than software development. I am regarded as an up and comer in my organization and work well and hard, but I am underutilized and underpaid. They also don't have a lot of promotion cycles so I don't feel I'm getting promoted as quick as my skills. I should hit senior level within a year or so.TLDRJust feeling lost at the moment. I feel starting a business is the only way to get uncapped salary but get stuck with idea paralysis and undeserved markets. I studied hard at a good university and graduated magna cum laude but I just feel stuck like I learned all that for nothing. Not utilizing enough of my skills at work and not getting paid enough and no calls back from jobs. With 60% of my pay going to a small house and food (not to mention medical bills) its tough to get ahead.",

Thousands of applications and only a small handful of interviews / calls have gone nowhere so they have amounted to a total waste of time. I'm applying all over the place, for pretty much anything remotely CS related I have most of the experience for so it's not like I only look for remote stuff or $100k+ stuff (in fact I don't even apply to positions that pay that much anymore because I know their standards are too high for me to meet). I have more personal projects that aren't on my resume but they are not really something that I can put on my resume as they don't generate money, aren't complete projects and have no users and aren't particularly impressive in any way, so in effect I am not doing anything at all every day.[worse resume link](https://imgur.com/a/eUrbC84)Here's a version of my resume where I removed the non programming stuff, the imperfect GPA, the irrelevant degree, the skills not related to positions on the resume as well as the video game projects as they probably don't count as real projects. To me it just looks even worse in every way and there is zero chance I can get hired with it? Does this mean I am unhireable? It looks like I didn't get anything for the past few years and thus I am a terrible employee that nobody should ever hire. There's also way too much white space because there is nothing more to say about each position that isn't just restating the same things over and over or saying extremely basic stuff (like they don't need to know the exact random libraries I used and it probably would look bad on me for talking about those? I also heard that me talking about something as basic as ajax requests is also bad?)[more complete resume link](https://imgur.com/a/iaYDKYg)Even with the more complete resume it still feels very terrible in terms of me competing with other people (I feel like maybe the bar for entry level is having several years of highly relevant non internship experience which I'm never going to get if I don't get a job). Adding in the skills for each position also breaks it when I put it into Workday so I have to get rid of them? It doesn't matter if it looks better to a human recruiter if the system parses it so badly I get trashed immediately so I should remove them?I just don't know at all what I should be doing to get a job? I haven't been working on \"real\" projects because I don't know how to make those (a project isn't real unless it's generating money and/or has a ton of users?). I know there is a definitive thing I should be doing but I don't know what it is? No amount of \"just do it\" is going to help me find that correct answer, I can't \"just make a game\" like my parents want because that is something that requires years of (non programming) work to make something profitable, and even then companies don't even see video game projects as real projects so all that effort would not help me even slightly?",

        "content": "For context, I attend a T50 school in the US in my locality, in a major East Coast metro area, and am double-majoring in CS and DS. Some roles I've been applying to include the usual Software Engineer / Developer roles of all stacks, Data Scientist, Data Analyst and the few database-specific roles that pop up, and even QA, Business Analyst, and various IT roles (that I'm probably woefully unqualified for anyways since I have 0 IT experience).Let's say the absolute worst happens, and no company hires me for any role between now and my graduation this coming May. In that case, I'd be forced to either become a NEET (and maybe even officially register for some form of unemployment), or (slightly less undesirably) end up in some retail or service job - something that doesn't require a CS degree - just to have *some* work.**What's the likelihood I'd end up in this situation? And if I do, what's the likelihood I'd ever be able to escape?**Now obviously, that's a pretty terrible fate to end up in long-term. So I think I'd need some form of \"game plan\". I've already worked some of these before as a student, and some of my older coworkers there have been \"failed\" students in non-CS STEM fields.And since I wouldn't want to work there forever, I'd likely still be applying to \"real\" jobs on the side, and maybe even landing a few interviews if I'm fortunate, but things might not improve, and could even worsen. This current \"employer's market\" might last for a while (I heard for civil engineering it took nearly an entire decade), and unfortunately, it's possible my skills and degree could risk atrophying in the meantime. And this could kill my motivation to do LeetCode / side projects, etc.And what the hell are you even supposed to tell the hiring team if you do get an interview for a tech position? \"I couldn't find work out of college so I had to work at the local grocery store / restaurant\"? How are you going to convince the hiring managers to consider you over some other cracked junior who has *not* needed to resort to menial labor in order to make ends meet or prevent a career gap?At what point should I simply admit defeat? At what point do I seriously consider reskilling into non-tech roles? (I'm already having trouble with even \"adjacent\" roles like DA and BA.) Which non-tech roles, even? I don't think I'd be able to break into law, medicine, nursing, or most trades, and even if I could, I don't think I'd have the requisite interest.For the sake of discussion, my definition of \"winning\" would be to have enough money to move out of my parents' house in the suburbs and rent an apartment somewhere major enough for me to have a satisfactory social and romantic life. Doesn't have to be 6 figs, FAANG, or even a SWE role at all. Don't even have to actually do it, just have to *make enough money to do it*, and if the job is really local I could just spend ~1-2 extra years at home and save the earnings to be frugal.You cannot do this by stocking shelves or flipping burgers for $15/hour. And if I'm forced to care for ailing parents on that salary while their home - the home I grew up in - goes to rot, then oh boy, things are *not* going to be pretty.",

But the last few months have been chaos. Management’s scrambling, people are quitting or quietly transferring, and entire projects are collapsing faster than they can be reassigned.Half the people I used to rely on have left, and now I’m basically maintaining random fragments of systems that no one else touches. There’s no mentorship, no technical challenge, and definitely no direction. Every day feels like “keep the lights on” mode.The thing is — I’m not overworked. I’m **understimulated.** The job’s too easy, the pay’s on the low side, and the feeling of stagnation is eating me alive. I used to love coding — building stuff, solving problems, learning new tech — now I just click through Jira tickets and slowly detach a bit more each week.I’ve thought about quitting a hundred times. I’ve even enrolled in a part-time Master’s starting next year as a soft reset — not because I need the degree, but because I need structure and a sense of progress again.But with Christmas coming up and everything slowing down, part of me thinks, *“just coast through the holidays, collect the chill paycheck, maybe even get a promo before you dip.”*Then another part of me goes, *“why am I still trying to climb a ladder I don’t even want to be on?”*I know a lot of people here are probably going through their own flavor of career existentialism — either can’t find the perfect job, can’t get one at all, or are stuck in something that’s fine on paper but quietly soul-draining. I just want to hear from anyone who’s in this same weird spot.How did you break out of the comfort trap early in your career?

So here's my question: how do I start again? Here's where I am at right now. I already rebuilt my resume, updated my LinkedIn and GitHub to match my current experience, and I have a personal website I already included on my resume and attach on any application. My previous internship had be working on Backend JavaScript most of the time, and my current place utilizes php, python, and CRM development whenever I'm doing programming stuff. I really prefer C# and JavaScript. Admittedly I have not worked on a personal project in a long time, but I intend to work on some C# related projects soon. Where should I be looking for positions? Is it still LinkedIn, or is there a better option? Are there any programming languages that are high in demand right now that I should focus on instead? Should I use a different version of my resume each time I apply for anywhere? I've been out of the game for a while, and I know it's only gotten worse. I'm wondering what my next step should be now that I at least have something worth a damn to put on a resume, or if I should just abandon ship and use my experience for something adjacent.

Now, I have to fly back to my home country without a degree because of my university situation, visa issues, health, and safety from my own mental health.I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for what I should do next. I’m interested in web development, but lately I’ve also become more drawn to cybersecurity. I just don’t know where to start once I’m back home. My country is still quite conservative about degrees (I think), and honestly, I’m really scared.Aside from freelancing on Upwork, does anyone have ideas on how to survive, what kind of business or freelance work could actually be sustainable or beneficial? I really want to repay my parents for everything they’ve done for me over the last eight years, but I don’t know how or where to begin.Thank you so much for any advice. Please, only comment if you have something genuinely helpful. I already have enough hate in my own head, thank you.",

I brought these concerns up to my manager and team lead, and they agreed I could work on the product in the meantime. However, the ones leading development refuse to break out work into workable portions and insist on mobbing or working on the code themself. I don't know why they do this, but it leaves me either DM'ing them constantly asking for work to do, or filling my time with random tasks that no one wants to touch.On the bright side, I've learned a lot about containerization, deployment, and CI/CD configurations.I'm feeling disgruntled and feel like I can't take ownership of a piece of the product. I'm still early in my career, so I'm also looking for ways to showcase my skills and grow.

Base is 150k with healthy equity (was able to bump equity a bit through negotiation). In total, I sent out around 200 apps. 150 were through linkedin or company career sites, and the remaining 50 were through recruiters recommending me to companies on paraform, which had a much higher success rate. During that month-long job hunt, I did 44 interviews with 20 different companies. I also had 12 recruiter calls. I made it to 3 final rounds and got one offer. Honestly, I’m very lucky my current company gives me a low enough workload to cram so many interviews.",

        "author": "moondaybitch",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm in the fortunate position to have 2 job offers right now. One of which is full remote (permanently), and the other is in person 4 days a week, with a 1 day WFH policy. The remote gig would be a pretty good salary bump from my current role and has comparable benefits to my current position, which is also remote (but less time off). The in office gig would be significantly better benefits when it comes to PTO, retirement contributions, and while the base salary is the same as the other role, there is an annual discretionary bonus that I have been told averages 35-65% of your base salary (but of course... discretionary) which would make it SIGNIFICANTLY more financially desirable. I had a really great impression of the culture at both companies in my interviews, however a friend of my mentor warned her that the in office place has toxic tendencies, not from personal experience but via the grapevine from others in the same industry. This really surprised me as I felt like everyone I met was SO friendly and nice and that I would really enjoy working with them, but I don't want to fully discount his take as my mentor trusts him. That said, based on glassdoor reviews I am getting a picture that a certain side of the company is pretty toxic, however the team I'm joining has no overlap with that group. But it's hard to know where the spillover is of course. I have heard good things about the remote company's culture, but my friend who works there has told me he has some issues with upper leadership's direction (but has said he thinks those issues would exist at most companies). The remote one is more of a career advancing step into a leadership position, whereas the in office one is somewhere I would get to grow my skills and work closely with mentors to improve technically. I would definitely be locking in in either role to perform well, but with slightly different dynamics. I have about 5 years of experience, so while I think I could tackle the remote leadership opportunity, I don't feel as secure in my skillset as I might want to be in order to perform really well in such a high impact role -- so I think that role would involve a high degree of personal time spent learning off the job to make sure I could keep up. The remote role has much more flexible hours so I could continue to step out for an occasional 2pm pilates class if I felt like it, but there is an on call component where I would need to do unpaid overtime occasionally outside of core hours. On the contrary, obviously I'm not doing a workout class in the middle of the day if I take the in office role, but there is no on-call component and the interviewers I spoke with all told me they have never done any overtime and that when they close their laptops at the end of the day, that's really it, which also appeals to me as the remote boundary blurring has been a big issue in my current role as well.Both have tech stacks I see as very transferrable skills, although my mentor pointed out the remote one would have much better name recognition when it came time to job hunt next. (Another positive about the in office role is that everyone I spoke with has been there 5+ years, which seemed like a really positive sign about retention). I am honestly very tempted by the in office role, but multiple friends have told me I'm nuts for not taking the remote role and the phrase \"blinded by money\" has been used. Curious to get some more takes from people who are also working in tech on what's the right move as I do need to come to a decision this weekend.",

Sometimes I feel embarrassed seeing my classmates move ahead while I feel like I can’t keep up.I enjoy programming and creating things, but lately it’s been hard to maintain the pace. I’m receiving psychological and psychiatric treatment, but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. I just feel exhausted.If I continue in my current program, it would probably take me about 2.5 more years if everything goes perfectly, which honestly seems unlikely.If I switch universities, I would likely have to start almost from scratch (3.5 more years).And if I quit completely, I’m afraid of being directionless and feeling even more stuck.What worries me the most is the future:I want to work in technology, grow into leadership or managerial roles, and eventually emigrate. But I don’t know if I absolutely need a university degree for that, or if I could build that path through technical certifications and work experience. However, I have this thought that without a degree I won’t be “anyone.”In summary:•I feel emotionally drained and frustrated.•I don’t want to keep spending money if I’m not making progress.•I also don’t want to give up without thinking it through; I’ve already made too many bad decisions.Has anyone been through something similar?Is it worth continuing the university route, or is it better to try something else?Any honest opinions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.Thanks for reading.",

I get to work on cool stuff and have a solid engineering company on my cv. It's much more of a long term investment, however, my salary remains the same (with some great benefits) but my rent essentially doubles and cost of living also increases because I have to relocate for it.So, boil it down to big money at a start up that's pretty much run on vibes and feelings or less money at a big corp but a much more solid career track?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I keep getting an excellent feedback about my technical ability, yet, I get shit about my soft skills. The thing is, they won't tell what's the actual problem. All I hear are \"oh, you don't like small talk much\" or \"You're rude and not diplomatic enough\".How I would describe myself:1) I indeed don't like small talk, I know more or less how it works, I just find it annoying and sort of pointless. I know that's how you can create a relationship and such... But I see those guys, at best, 2 times within a year when the team gets of remote, why would anyone care about that? I'm, like all of them, there for the money and thats that... It will read \"machiavelistic\", assholish or something like that but for the last decade give or take the only relationships I built, or tried to build, was with people where I saw something that I could gain from. It was either people who were smarter than me, people with connections or information that I wanted (although sometimes I think there was misjudgement and I was thinking about getting laid, or at best it was connection of both). This kind of worked and let me get my foot in the door, despite many shortcoming on my end at the time. The issue is, these people are out of the picture, atm way too often I do feel like I'm the smartest person in the room, or, at the very least, knowing the smarter person won't get me anywhere, feel like it's just a matter of a workplace. It ain't Google, Microsoft or anything of the kind, its just some run of the mill company pushing out overengineered, slow, unmaintainable code. Wasnt it for the bad market and my decent pay (Ill have hard time finding a job where Ill get a payrise significant enough to risk a job change in this market. These people won't get me anywhere other than up the ladder in the company, but even so, I rarely get to interact with people other than a lead of my project whos a bit of a pushover. I mean, I don't see any other solution to the issue than reprogamming myself (how???) to attempt building relationships with anyone, not just someone I want to bang or where I feel like there is a clear benefit to gain from them. Only person that I feel like I really somewhat connected at the firm is a tester designated to my project who hates and trashtalks it about as much as I do, that made us have something in common...2) I'm the kind of guy that leaves a lot of comments under PRs. I get a cred for it, at the very least from upper management. It's not about the extra spaces or formatting, although at extreme cases I'll point that out, I just hate mess or the \"iterative development\" where lack of code review lets very obvious bugs get to the repo, hinder development and generate more work (more PRs). Most people at my company don't do the review, but were getting back to 1) here - most people at my firm are just bad/very average devs (or at the very least lack ambition or are burned out).3) I tend to be \"judgemental\" or \"rude\". This is coming from me sometimes pointing out someone did a poor job (overengineer a feature, create a poorly worded ticket etc.) without beating around the bush. The thing is, I'm not completely f-ed in the head, I don't do that from day one, the frustation really needs to reach the boiling point where the same thing happens a number of times. But you know what sucks about it, that I give a shit about being \"rude\" or \"judgemental\"? When I tried being nice, giving \"constructive criticism\" at retros, vaguely pointing out things that could be improved... Nothing f happened. You know the routine, theres action point, theres fake action to handle it, then maybe there is a call on what to do, and then somewhat checks the issue as resolved and we move on. Only by expressing my frustation over a longer period, so it was finally escalated to a person that gives a damn, my points that I gave several figureheads finally started to be taken seriously, I made an impact. At the end of the day, the person that matters, sees it as a double edged sword (or something like that) - this dude cares about this project and this company, but hes a douchebag/cant get his point across via diplomatic means.TLDR: I dont know how to force myself to small talk / building relationships that I find \"pointless\" i.e. without easy to spot value and don't know how to communicate issues/suggest improvements (it feels like at my current firm I need to break the chain of command and go the highest person immediately)",

Currently, I'm loving the job, although there's obviously learning curves to overcome each day. I've had positive reviews so far and my responsibilities do continue to grow so I think I'm keeping up with the pace well.That being said, the company I work at is a big global company, so the teams are quite specialized. My team in particular is all-things reliability, but I feel like I need to expand my skillsets. I rarely have the chance to work with k8s, docker, terraform, AWS/GCP, istio, and all those stuff in the DevOps & Infra side of things and part of me feels like I should in order to keep more career options open. My question is, can I do that outside of my actual work? In other words is it possible to get (hire-able) working knowledge & skills of these technologies through independent side projects, self-study & certifications supplemented with only SRE work experience (mainly dealing with observability, load testing, launch readiness testing, DR, etc).On one hand I know I had these exact concerns when I first pivoted, but I feel like having junior level expectations was very different.",
