        "content": "In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:* Announcing they are quitting* Complaining they can't get a job* Complaining they can't do their current job* \"I heard DE is dead. Source: me. Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok. I am 21 years old\"* Needing projects* Begging for \"tips\" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)* Also begging for \"tips\" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)I thought a nice change of pace was required. So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.About me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)). Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform. I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.My work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager. Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime. Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked. They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to. Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.I dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom. If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it. Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away. I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to). My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.Regularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything. Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of \"arsehole pay\" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.Before I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt. Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions. My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with Â£40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay. The \"bad job market\" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter. If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with. AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer. Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is. Yes, I am shaming you.* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better. You don't need more courses. You don't need guidance. You don't need a fucking mentor. You need discipline, motivation, and drive. Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices. You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.* If you want to keep going: then keep going. Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are \"talented\" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is \"average\". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning. The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal. What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6. What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3. Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you. There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you. We're all good at something, friends. Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.AMAEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies. If I suspect you are replying with an AI, you're giving me the permission to roast the fuck out of you.",

        "content": "**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** Every position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they \"think we should be able to use AI to be more productive\".** I feel like I have been searching for that mystical \"dream job\" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. Even though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** I have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines). Before the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. We've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. **My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. As AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. Most of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought. Or maybe I have just had bad luck.",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering I recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ calledÂ flash\\_hash\\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up toÂ **2x faster**Â than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.**GitHub Repo:**Â [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\\_hash\\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)This post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-PartitionedThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.The industry-standard approach is theÂ **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a \"divide and conquer\" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.However, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designedÂ **Unpartitioned**Â concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.The reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.I implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings:Â **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for SpeedWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing** This is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS** To allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution isÂ **Shard Locking**Â (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash:Â lock\\_array\\[hash(key) % 2048\\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator** The build-side hash table in a join has a critical property:Â **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: theÂ **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly freeâjust a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminatesÂ mallocÂ overhead and memory fragmentation.**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array** A potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallelÂ tagÂ array ofÂ uint8\\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in theÂ tagÂ array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byteÂ tag. Only if theÂ tagÂ matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching** The probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I useÂ **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to \"tell\" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process keyÂ iÂ in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that keyÂ i+NÂ (whereÂ NÂ is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access: \\_mm\\_prefetch((void\\*)&table\\[hash(keys\\[i+N\\])\\], \\_MM\\_HINT\\_T0); While the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to keyÂ i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing** Instead of a generic library likeÂ xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions: uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) { uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB; uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key); return crc * ((k << 32) + 1); }TheÂ \\_mm\\_crc32\\_u32Â is anÂ **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse thanÂ xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't WorkNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few \"great\" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensiveÂ **Gather**Â operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win inÂ **low-hit-rate**Â scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overheadâevery key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the \"grouping\" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.# ConclusionThe performance ofÂ flash\\_hash\\_joinÂ doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.* **Details**: Squeezing performance withÂ tagÂ arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.Most importantly, this entire process wasÂ **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out \"optimizations\" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.I hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.Note: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\\_efficient\\_hash\\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",

        "content": "I've been doing data things for awhile now, full-time for \\~6 years since graduating, as a full data engineer for \\`4 years. It seems every job I reach a point every year or two where motivation drops and I just don't care anymore. Performance begins to drop. When the going gets real hard I go get another job, I have climbed up to a senior role now. Fortunately this employment history of two years per organization seems to be acceptable.Problem is I am here again. Have been interviewing for roles and trying to get excited again about new projects. Interviewing for some lead roles and already have an offer to lead migration from DBT to a streaming setup. But I wonder if I'm setting myself up for failure. I do enjoy technical challenges but I do sort of feel like I am only using one side of my brain as a data engineer.Am I just burnt out and maybe need a break? I feel like even with a break the same thing would eventually come back. I don't currently have a stressful job, for example I work about 30 hours a week maybe I need to find value from other parts of life.I am also looking at going back to school for a master's to pick up some skills that would allow me to maybe work on more interesting projects (don't have the CS or engineering undergrad background, would maybe be cool to explore other technical subjects) Not thinking I'd suddenly become a game developer but I love to tinker and maybe having more fundamentals would allow me to get a personal project off the ground to the point where that could be a full-time job. I would love to have more product-focused SWE skills versus just being able to migrate DBT models to Databricks. But the downside is becoming a poor student again when I already have a career, maybe just not the one I want.Anyone who has done DE type work for longer able to comment? Are these types of low points normal, or a hint I should try to continue to find something else?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, sorry if my English isnât very good.**TL;DR:** Iâm a fresh graduate in Actuarial Science. Got a Jr. Data Engineer role, but the Senior DE quit right before I joined now Iâm the only DE. Everything is a mess (broken pipelines, legacy code, poor management, no guidance, layoffs). On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. Iâm learning a lot, but Iâm burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.I just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here itâs common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.Fast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills werenât as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.To my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasnât ready for what I found:* No documentation* Broken pipelines* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic* Broken dashboards and angry users* A messy data lake with no organization* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who donât know what they need* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong* A âdata scientistâ who is really used as an analytics engineerRight now, Iâm doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like Iâm always just fixing problems. Thereâs one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for âbig changesâ with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.After a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the companyâs vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone. Now I have no guidance, I donât know where weâre heading, and Iâm doubting my skills.**What would you do in my position? Should I quit and go back to the actuarial path?**",

        "author": "Then_Difficulty_5617",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on optimizing joins between two very large tables (hundreds of millions of records each) in a data lake environment. I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.Based on my research, hereâs a quick summary of my understanding:* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. Itâs more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.My main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.Given this, I have a few questions for the community:1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?I'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation. Any advice or examples you can share would be a huge help! Thanks in advance.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm excited to share a practical guide on implementing real-time, automated data lineage for Kafka Connect. This solution uses a custom Single Message Transform (SMT) to emit OpenLineage events, allowing you to visualize your entire pipelineâfrom source connectors to Kafka topics and out to sinks like S3 and Apache Icebergâall within Marquez.It's a \"pass-through\" SMT, so it doesn't touch your data, but it hooks into the `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states to give you a complete picture in Marquez.**What it does:**- **Automatic Lifecycle Tracking:** Capturing `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states for your connectors.- **Rich Schema Discovery:** Integrating with the Confluent Schema Registry to capture column-level lineage for Avro records.- **Consistent Naming & Namespacing:** Ensuring your Kafka, S3, and Iceberg datasets are correctly identified and linked across systems.I'd love for you to check it out and give some feedback. The source code for the SMT is in the repo if you want to see how it works under the hood.**You can run the full demo environment here:**Factor House Local - https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local**And the full guide + source code is here:**Kafka Connect Lineage Guide - https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/blob/main/projects/data-lineage-labs/lab1_kafka-connect.mdThis is the first piece of a larger project, so stay tunedâI'm working on an end-to-end demo that will extend this lineage from Kafka into Flink and Spark next.Cheers!",

Note that I did suggest a threshold or margin to flag discrepancies but they refused. The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.That doesnât seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data â so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.Is this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation Iâve already done to show itâs solid.

They have *another* internal python tool that a previous dev wrote to do the same thing (S3 CSV or flat file etc -> write to PG db). Then that dev left. Now the architect wrote a new open-source tool (up on github at least) during some sabbatical time that he wants to start using. No one on the team really understands the two existing tools and this just feels like more not-invented-here tech debt.

For example, adding a new column requires updating a notebook in Databricks and sometimes a DAG in Git.How should I organize these Python files for a streamlined workflow? Should I keep both DAGs and notebooks in a single Git repo for consistency? Or is there a better approach (e.g., DBFS, Azure Blob Storage)?

Given that the company is doing quite well and we are expanding our client base a lot, there's a need to have a more modern (or at least better-performant) architecture to serve our data needs. Since no one was really familiar with modern data platforms, they hired only me (I'll be responsible for devising our modernization strategy and mapping the needed skillset for further hires - which I hope happens soon :D ) My strategy is to pick one (or a few) use cases and showcase the value that having our data in Snowflake would bring to the company. Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy). My current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)My comments / questions are \\- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS? \\- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified) \\- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS? \\- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?) Any insights or comments from similar experiences are welcomed :)",

I'd prefer it to be general purpose solution for everything (and ditch current setup completely) but also I'd accept it to be a solution only for critical data/calculations.The solution should be on-premise and allow Spark computations.How to build such a thing? We are currently thinking about Apache Ozone for storage (one baremetal cluster stretched to 3 datacenters, replication factor of 3, rack-aware setup) and 2-3 kubernetes (one for each datacenter) for Spark computations. But I am afraid our cross-datacenter network will be bottleneck. One idea to mitigate that is to force kubernetes Spark to read from Ozone nodes from its own datacenter and reach other dc only when there is no available replica in the datacenter (I have not found a way to do that in Ozone docs).What would you do?",

For context, the base data on which we want to visualize metrics is about \\~5TB of metrics data daily, with 2+ years of data. The goal is to visualize to daily fidelity, with a high level of slice and dice.So far my process has been to precompute aggregable metrics across all queryable dimensions (imagine group by date, country, category, etc), and then point something like Snowflake or Trino at it to aggregate over those aggregated partials based on the specific filters. The issue is this is still a lot of data, and sometimes these query engines are still slow (couple seconds per query), which is annoying from a user standpoint when using a dashboard.I'm wondering if it makes sense to pre-aggregate all OLAP combinations but in a more key-value oriented way, and then use Postgres hstore or Cassandra or something to just do single-record lookups. Or maybe I just need to give up on the pipe dream of sub second latency for highly dimensional slices on petabyte scale data.Has anyone had any awesome success enabling a similar use case?",

I needed vector search with sophisticated metadata filtering, but existing solutions were either,-Too bloated (full vector databases when I needed something minimal for analysis)-Limited in filtering capabilities-Had unintuitive APIs that I was not happy about.I wanted something minimal, fast, and with an API that feels natural - inspired by Polars, which I absolutely love.What Makes Otters DifferentExact Search: Perfect for small-to-medium datasets (up to ~10M vectors) where accuracy matters more than massive scale.Performance: -SIMD-accelerated scoring-Zonemaps and Bloom filters for intelligent chunk pruningPolars-Inspired API: Write filters as simple expressions```meta_store.query(query_vec, Metric::Cosine) .meta_filter(col(\"price\").lt(100) & col(\"category\").eq(\"books\")) .vec_filter(0.8, Cmp::Gt) .take(10) .collect()```The library is in very early stages and there are tons of features that i want to addPython bindings, NumPy supportSerialization and persistenceParquet / Arrow integrationVector quantizationetc.I'm primarily a Python/JAX/PyTorch developer, so diving into rust programming has been an incredible learning experience.If you think this is interesting and worth your time, please give it a try.I welcome contributions and feedback !https://crates.io/crates/otters-rshttps://github.com/AtharvBhat/otters",

I currently work in healthcare and have a degree from a STEM background (Bio pre-med focus) to be specific. As I am looking into the job market, I understand that it is very hard to land a starting/junior position currently especially as someone who does not have a Bachelor's Degree in CS/IT or any prior tech internships. Although self-studying has been going well, I thought it would also be a good idea to pursue a Master's Degree in order to beef up my chances of landing an internship/job. Does anyone have recommendations for solid (and preferably affordable) online MS programs? One that has been recommended to me for example is UC Berkeley's Online Info and Data Science program as you can get into different roles including data engineering. This one appeals a lot to me even though the cost is high because it doesn't require GRE scores or a prior CS/IT degree. I understand that this can be easily looked up to see what schools are out there, but I wanted to know if there are any that the people in this thread personally recommend or don't recommend since some of the \"Past Student Feedback\" quotes on school sites can tricky.

Other people in my team do not have almost any data engineering expertise and limited software engineering experience.We have a bunch of simple Python ETL scripts, getting data from various sources to our database. Now they are running on crontab on a remote server. Now I suggested implementing some CI/CD practices around our codebase, including creating a CI/CD pipeline for code testng and stuff. And my teammates are now suggesting that we should run our actual Python code inside those pipelines as well.I think that this is a terrible idea due to numerous reasons, but I'm also not experienced enough to be 100% confident. So that's why I'm reaching out to you - is there something that I'm missing? Maybe it's OK to execute them in ADO Pipeline?(I know that optimally this should be run somewhere else, like a K8s cluster, but let's say that we don't have access to those resources - that's why I'm opting with just staying in crontab).",

What I wanted to know was, which tools do I need to use to simulate/replace Foundry. I've never had experience with Databricks but people say it's the closest? I believe the advantage of Foundry is having everything ready-made, but it's also a double-edged sword since everything gets locked into the platform (besides being extremely expensive).",

        "author": "Aware_Actuator4939",

        "content": "I'm interested in making a pivot to data engineering. Like the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kp2puy/am_i_too_old/), I'm in my 60s and plan to work until I'm 75 or so. Unlike that person, I have a background in technical support, IT services, and data processing. From 2007 to 2018, I worked as a data operator for a company that does data processing for financial services and health benefits businesses. I taught myself Python, Ruby, and PowerShell and used them to troubleshoot and repair problems with the data processing pipelines. From 2018 to 2023, I did email and chat tech support for Google Maps Platform APIs. Like literally millions of other people, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate course and started researching data careers. I think that I would prefer data engineering over data science or data analytics, but from my research, I concluded that I would need a master's degree to get into data engineering, while it would be possible to get a data analytics job with a community college degree and a good data portfolio.In 2023, I started taking classes for a computer information technology associate's degree at my local community college. Earlier this year, though, I discovered online university WGU (Western Governors University) has bachelor's and master's degrees in data analytics. The bachelor's degree has a much better focus on data analytics than my community college degrees. The WGU data analytics [master's degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html) (MSDA) has a specialization in data engineering, which reawakened my interest in the field. I've been preparing to start at WGU to earn the [bachelor's in data analytics](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-bachelors-program.html) (BSDA), then enroll in the master's degree with data engineering specialization. Last month, WGU rolled out four degree programs in [Cloud and Network Engineering](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-network-engineering-bachelors-program.html) (General, AWS, Azure, and Cisco specializations). Since then, I've been trying to decide if I would be better off earning one of those degrees (instead of the BSDA) to prepare for the MSDA.Some of the courses in the **BS in Data Analytics (BSDA)**:* Data Management (using SQL) (3 courses)* Python programming (3 courses), R programming (1 course)* Data Wrangling* Data Visualization* Big Data Foundations* Cloud Foundations* Machine Learning, Machine Learning DevOps (1 course each)* Network and Security - Foundations (only 1 course)Some of the courses in the **BS in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure Specialization) (BSCNE)**:* Network and Security - Foundations (same course as above)* Networks (CompTIA Network+)* Network and Security Applications (CompTIA Security+)* Network Analytics and Troubleshooting* Python for IT Automation* AI for IT Automation and Security* Cloud Platform Solutions* Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Orchestration* Cloud and Network Security ModelsBesides Network+ and Security+, I would earn CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions certifications in the BSCNE degree. The BSDA degree would give me AWS Cloud Practitioner and a couple of other certifications.If you've gotten this far - thank you! Thank you very much! Also, I have questions:1. Would the master's in Data Analytics (Data Engineering specialization) from **WGU** be worth it for a data engineering job seeker?2. If so, which WGU bachelor's degree would be better preparation for the data engineering MSDA and a later data engineering role - the bachelor's in Data Analysis, or the bachelor's in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure or AWS)?",

        "content": "Iâm excited to share my latest project:Â **PyRMap**, a lightweight R-Python bridge designed to make data exchange between R and Python faster and cleaner.*What it does:*PyRMap allows R to pass data to Python via memory-mapped files (mmap) for near-zero overhead communication. The workflow is simple:1. R writes the data to a memory-mapped binary file.2. Python reads the data and processes it (even running models).3. Results are written back to another memory-mapped file, instantly accessible by R.*Key advantages over reticulate:** :high_voltage: Performance: As shown in my benchmark, for \\~1.5â¯GB of data, PyRMap is significantly faster than reticulate â reducing data transfer times by 40%* :broom: Clean & maintainable code: Data is passed via shared memory, making the R and Python code more organized and decoupled (check example 8 from here -Â [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example\\_8\\_reticulate\\_comparation](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example_8_reticulate_comparation)). Python runs as a separate process, avoiding some of the overhead reticulate introduces.https://preview.redd.it/mhcpmljn1bof1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b557ef319ddb8f5ae0d2f3ea2647eb1f69bfe1Current limitations:* Linux-only* Only supports running the entire Python script, not individual function calls.* Intermediate results in pipelines are not yet accessible.PyRMap is also part of a bigger vision: RR, a custom R interpreter written in RPython, which I hope to launch next year.Check it out here:Â [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap)Would you use a tool like this?",

Sometimes, this is implicitly the poll date or current date.Do you pack all of this into the bucket uri? If so, are you scanning bucket contents to determine start point whenever you start the next batch?Do you maintain a separate `ops` table somewhere to keep this information? How is your experience maintaining the OPs table?Do you completely offload this logic into the orchestration layer, using its metadata store? Does that implicate on the difficulty of debugging in some cases?Do you embed this data in the response? If so, are you scanning your raw data to determine start point in subsequent runs or do you scan your raw table (table = post processing results of the raw formatted data)?Do you implement sensors between every stage in the data lifecycle to automatically batch process the entire process in an event driven way?

        "content": "Hey everyone,I just started my first ever job as a junior dev last week (fresh out of school), and honestly it already feels like a disaster. Iâm starting to question myself a bit.My first day was Monday, and by Friday I was already in home office. Same today too and Monday too. The only office days are Wednesday and Thursday, which feels a bit sad because Iâm brand new and immediately working from home with barely any guidance is to much.I never really got a proper introduction to the project, the systems, or how tickets are normally solved. My very first ticket was basically: âYo, look in our system, I have a ticket for you, try to solve it. If you have questions, ask meâ¦â Thatâs it. No walkthrough, no explanation of where to start. I asked how they usually approach tickets or where to even find the relevant code, but I still felt pretty lost.To be fair, I did get a decent intro into the running software itself, so I kind of understand the product. But thatâs where it ended. Meanwhile, I see other people who started just a month before me sitting next to their team lead getting tons of explanations and support.Somehow I managed to solve 3 tickets (a mix of with and without help), but most of the time I have nothing to do. Iâm just sitting here, bored, not knowing what I should be learning or focusing on.Iâve tried to be proactive and ask what I could look into:Yesterday I asked if there were patterns or frameworks I should study. The response was just: âTake a look at EF and how we make the models\" EF and setting up a config for models isnt that hard so I understood it quite fast.Today I asked again and just got sent some tickets to read through âto see if I understand what the customer wants.â which is so overwhelming.Another coworker told me to check out their validation logic cause I will be working with this part of the project, but there are a ton of files with different rules and itâs overwhelming to dig into alone at home.So now Iâm just sitting here wondering: am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to feel this lost and useless in the first week? Or did I pick the wrong career path entirely?Itâs super frustrating because I want to learn and contribute, but right now it feels like Iâm just drifting.Has anyone else been in this situation? Is this just how the start usually feels, or is this a red flag?",

The Rules:We are given a problem to solve 10 - 20 min, the first team to finish gets the max grade, the second team gets one unit less, the third team another unit less and so on, if you don't finish in time you get 0. Here's the problem: I feel I have a solid foundation in python and sockets, but is not enough when everyone else is just using AI( Ctrl c + Ctrl v). As long as the code runs you get the grade. Meanwhile I try to understand things deeply and write my own solutions, but is hard to do it on your own when you only get 15-20 min, I freeze under pressure, even though I can solve the problems on my own if I had more time. This makes me feel like I am bad a programming because I can't solve something under time pressure, and that programing is not worth it anymore, I am trying to do my best, but it never seems enough, or am I looking at this the wrong way. Honestly I feel this grading system sucks since we are not encouraged to fail, debug or even learn how our code works, speed is the only thing that matters and that means pasting everything AI throws, I'm seriously considering dropping from that class and take it next semester with other teacher. I could be wrong of course I just want some guidance as to what to do next, Is this grading system fine?",

        "content": "\\*EDIT: Title should be \"not a good **teacher\"**I hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.I just completed boot.dev's \"Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go\" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.In the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying \"yayayayaya\", or \"boom boom\", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.I would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.Secondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \\[\\]byte instead of string.The reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: \"Learn Go\", \"Build a Blog Aggregator in Go\" and \"Build an AI Agent in Python\". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.In Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",

I decided to end that trial to focus on myself and learn JavaScript again, then React and Node js. My biggest problem is I don't really know when to use what I learnt. I also think that I don't know how to translate the problem to smaller problems and solve then one by one. I feel super dumb when I'm stuck on a ticket for hours, and that my colleague solve it in like 20 minutes.After giving you some context, my question is : when programming, how do you manage to know which key notion to use to translate the solution into code ? I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more. Also, which kind of projects I can train to test my skills once I'll finish the courses ?

        "content": "It's day 4 of the very intense boot camp program school. I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. We're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The \"teachers\" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. I have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. I'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. I could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. Edit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.I'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. I have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. My life motto is \"one day or day one?\" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. Edit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)I know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions :face_with_tears_of_joy:), that does include my peers at 42. After failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. Now I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. So please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything. I will listen to those who have more experience than me.",

However, nothing ever seems to stick, I've been doing a full-stack course on Codecademy on and off but nothing seems to stick then I loose motivation for it. I enjoy using PHP and making the projects in school (and attempted ones at home) but I think it isn't used that much based on what I've read online. That's why I've been trying to learn other languages like JavaScript with Node.js. I also enjoy working with SQL databases.I guess what I'm mostly trying to ask is what is the best way to approach this blockage. I've tried using AI to help mentor me alongside the course (Not to solve just to help) but that's failed. I've tried note taking and YouTube videos as well.Edit: Thank you everyone for the very useful ideas I didnât expect to get this many replies. Iâm gonna try some of the suggestions out for a while and see how I go.",

A) Everything in computers is stored as binary (0/1) numbers.M) I thought that the RAM instructs the CPU to do calculationsA) CPU itself is requesting data to be read (from an address stored in instruction pointer) from a \"dumb\" (compared to CPU itself) device that just stores binary data.M) I knew before that instructions are being \"reused\" when you call functions, but when I started learning OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in (C++, C#) i thought that when you call a method on an instance of a class the compiler needs to generate separate functions for each instance. Like 'this' pointer is only being able to refer to the instance because the reference to an instance is baked into machine code.A) i found out 'this' pointer just passed to each function as invisible argument. Other OOP languages may work differently.M) I thought that OS is something different than machine code that regular peasants programs useA) It's same regular machine code, but It's more privileged. It has access to everything on the machine.M) The graphical interface of a programs made me think that's what programs are. A) Didn't see the true nature of programs, they consist of instructions to do computations and everything else what we call a graphical shell is merely a conveniences that are provided by Operating System software.M) I thought that GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is only device that is magically being able to draw 3D graphics.A) CPU could do the same but just really slow (no real time for demanding games), there's also integrated GPU that's built into \"processor\" but it's generally slower that dedicated ones.When there's no one explaining the computers from the low end to high end of course there's so much stupid assumptions and misconceptions. As a beginner coders in modern times we only start from the highest of abstractions in programming languages and only know about low end if we are curious enough. In the start of computers the programmers didn't have many high level programming languages so they knew what's going in their computers more than today's programmers.",

This is partially my fault and my schools because they implore us to use AI for almost every assignment. I shouldâve tried myself to complete the assignment, but every time I was lost, I went straight to AI. I probably know python the best, but still, my knowledge is very limited. Iâve tried projects outside of class and completed them just fine, but it felt like reading a book without understanding what Iâve read. Iâm extremely lost and now even more nervous about my future outside of school. What are the next steps I should take? Iâm desperate!!",

I've been searching for an online coding tutor, but most of what I'm finding is either way too advanced or clearly not designed for kids.We're not looking for a bootcamp or anything overly intense. Just someone who can meet weekly, answer questions, and guide him through projects. Ideally someone who understands how to teach younger students and keep it fun. He's already done some Scratch and Roblox Studio stuff, and he's now messing around with beginner Python and Unity.Are there good online programming tutors who actually specialize in working with kids or teens? I've seen a few platforms offering online coding tutoring, but it's hard to know what's legit. Open to individual instructors or programs just want something reliable and age-appropriate.If anyone has recommendations for online coding tutors or platforms they've used and liked, I'd really appreciate it.",

I wrote this to my future self so I could look back a year later and see if I had kept my promise . You will all be my witness. According to my plan I will practice every day using the \"pomodoro\" technique (50 minutes studying, 10 minutes resting every 4th \"pomodoro\", 30 minutes rest) for 12 hours. Right now I'm taking a JavaScript course on SuperSimpleDev (a very cool channel, I recommend it, there's also a course about React), after that I also want to take courses on FreecodeCamp and Odinproject on the basics of the frontend to consolidate everything, then I want to take a course on React and so on and so on . My goal is to get a full-time junior frontend job in a year even if I only get paid $100 a month, or nothing at all, it doesn't matter. I would appreciate any advice from experienced developers on how to make my learning more effective. Thank you in advance!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm working on an app that essentially allows you to log things you do throughout the day. So if I wake up at 7 AM and do Yoga on September 2, then later I look at the logs for September 2, I will see that I did in fact do Yoga at 7 AM.I'm really struggling with timezones, mainly because I have it in my head that times should always be stored in UTC, and it's a headache to get working.The standard advice is to store it in UTC and then convert to the users timezone when retrieving it, but this doesn't work here since I always want to see the log time relative to the timezone I was in at that time, not the one I'm in now (so if I was in California on September 2 when I did Yoga, then later I look at the log while I'm in New York, I still want to see that I did it at 7 AM, not that I did it 10 AM Eastern.)So the solution I came up with is to store started\\_at and ended\\_at in UTC, and also store the timezone offsets for wherever the user was at that time, that way I can always display the correct time for the logs. However, this seems really inefficient from a database indexing perspective. 99% of the log queries on the app are for a specific calendar day according to the users location on that day. Which means looking up logs for a specific day goes from the built in database timestamp magic, to having to query every log in a 3 day range, calculate the times adjusted for the saved timezone offset of that record, and then check if the date matches. So I also added a relative\\_start\\_date and relative\\_end\\_date to every log, which always stores whatever calendar date the log was started and finished on according to the user's timezone at that time. This way queries can easily be searched by date.The system kind of works, but I keep second guessing if it's really the best way. It feels like a lot of work and a lot of somewhat overlapping fields (started\\_at, ended\\_at, relative\\_start\\_date, relative\\_end\\_date, start\\_time\\_zone\\_offset, end\\_time\\_zone\\_offset) just to keep track of the time. It almost feels like it would be easier to just store the calendar date and then store start\\_time and end\\_time as seconds from midnight (and maybe an optional end\\_calendar\\_date for cases when the log spans two days), but I have it in my head that this is wrong and times should always be in stored in UTC.What do you guys think? How would you store times in this situation?",

I am wondering what is best for storing my problems, and its related data.Since the problems lists won't be that large, and won't be changing much, I was thinking of using SQLite, as from what I have heard it is the most simple to get up and running.Now, I have also been thinking about allowing users to create accounts on the site, and that may require the use of a more capable database, since there would be more frequent changes happening to the DB, which PostgreSQL might be better for this.Lastly, I have also taken into the consideration of using both DB's, one for the problems, and the other for handling users, but I am not sure if this is a wise decision. If this is feasible, then it would allow me to focus on SQLite for the problems, and then PostgreSQL when implementing users.I was just wondering about what the best approach is, thanks in advance.",

Unless of course people are using it on 100 files with 1000 LOC.Now, I also know Rust partly and with my experience of programming languages, it wouldn't be an issue for me to learn Rust (the parts required) while developing the project. Same for Golang.Ultimately, I want to develop it in C, but as someone currently looking for jobs and hopes that this project may get some good attraction, I'm worried that choosing C may become a problem. Finding contributors, people seeing C as not a modern language.I have the feeling that using Rust, Golang or even Zig may attract more attention to the project.I would definitely use the project for myself, but it would be good to have people be excited about it and join in it.Need views.",

        "content": "Dear all,I'm a linguist interested in some obscure things. I need something simple that gets the job done with the lowest learning curve. Anyway, what I need is the ability to:1) import data - let's say, all the words from a dictionary of a certain language in a column.2) I would like to be able to remove predefined letters or letter strings/combinations from this database of all words.3) after the letters are removed, get a list of all leftover letter strings/combinations (2 or 3 letters combinations, not more than that).4) sort the list by how many times a string is repeated in the database.5) possibly compare the top 100 combinations in multiple languages (I would do steps 1-4 for a couple languages or just import a new column and set the premade steps 2-4 to work on it) to see if they overlap. Some of the steps may get mixed up. \\---Do I really need to learn to code to do this? Instinctually, this appears to be relatively simple and could be done even without learning how to code. But correct me if I am wrong. So far, AI has shown a bit of misdemeanor and not given me or people I know a flat out answer when the question was something very similar to what I am looking for and I would like to, therefore, skip using AI for this task. That said, I would like to learn to program enough to be able to do what is described above and get back to working with language as fast as possible. If I can do it without AI and without learning programming, even better. And maybe there is a way. Let me know. If you need more input, also, let me know. I tried to be as detailed as possible without overwhelming you with linguistics.God bless!",

My masters program ever so slightly touched on some technical aspects of computing, and I kind of got the bug for it intellectually. I started learning a few languages, but I've always been the type of person who needs to understand why something rather than just how. Thus, I've decided to learn computer science in a real way, which led me to SICP.Look, I'm not dumb, but damn this book makes me feel like a moron. I'll be reading and getting it pretty well, and then it throws an exercise at me that makes me question my worth as a human being.Some of the exercises are fine, and I get it mostly right and understand what's going on with my mistakes, but some just feel way beyond me (it's the Simpson rule exercise that prompted me to write this btw).I guess I'm just wondering if this is a normal feeling, or do I need a new hobby? Again, to be fair, I actually feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of what the book is getting at; working through recursions from recursive and iterative frames was really instructive, and seeing the general summation formula was a big eureka moment for me, but good God that exercise brought me right back down to earth.",

I want to continue coding further however Iâm so lost on what to do in order to continue. I know a big thing with Java is android app development, however I donât daily drive an android.But just in general, I donât have the slightest idea on where to go to develop even just simple .exes or apps on my computer. I know the Java covered in the AP class is obviously not enough but I have no idea where to go next after all the material learned in the class.The big thing I want to do with coding is mostly just developing apps (specifically for homebrewed devices like my 3DS) but even then I donât know how to make an app in general. I know app development takes a pretty big commitment to do, but I just want to try even if itâs just on my free time. Another thing would just be making mods on games I play.Also another question is if I should just learn a different language like C++, as that has much more use cases (for me atleast) or if something like Java is enough. So Iâm just wondering what I can do with my knowledge from the class and where to go next.If you guys can share some resources, that would be seriously appreciated.Thanks",

Isn't fork supposed to create identical copies of parent? Are we allocating space for a and b in both if as well as else statements?Edit: I explained my doubt poorly, so copy pasting the actual explanation from my replies.I think I explained my thought process poorly. After fork(), there should be two processes with their own logical memory. They will have stack pointer, pointing to the same logical address in their own logical memory. Lets say its x. Now if I declare an integer of 4 bytes, stack would point to x+4, next if I declare a 8 byte integer, pointer should be at x+12. Both processes should have the same addresses for a and b then, x and then x+4. Does this make sense?",

        "content": "Hello everyone,So, for anyone with some time to spare, I need some advice about a project I'd like to realize.I would like to code a pretty simple board game - basically, one that would involve throwing a dice to move your character on some tiles with various effects, and a kind of fortune wheel. No animation besides maybe the player's pawn moving along the way. Multiple players of course, and if not a true multiplayer, at least a way to make a program that could have various entries and parameters set by the gamemaster.I have a tad of experience with Python, and it'd be useful for me to learn more, so that would be my fav medium if possible, along with it allowing me to make it a downloable exe file.All that being said, what program/language/game engine would you recommend ? I looked up a few, and so far the most notable ones seem to be Pygames if I wanna do everything from scratch, or websites like Screentop or Boardgame.(Related coding question : how would you implement the different pathways a pawn can take with a given dice number ? My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement. What logic could I use to make my program give the player the option to say, with a throw of 4, go back and forth to end up on the same tile ?)Thank you so much in advance for your help, and have a good day !",

Because of that, I'm actually much closer to getting a CS degree than an SE degree in terms of coursework. I've read a few discussions about which degree people should go into from an interest POV, but I'm asking purely from a practical employability POV. Some people have noted that WGU's SE degree might not be as mathematically rigorous as others, but it is ABET-accredited, which seemed to be the differentiator for Mechanical Engineers when I worked as an intern (non-ABET were essentially looked at as a liability).My questions are: \\- Does one degree have better job prospects in this market? \\- SE doesn't require much math; is it looked at in a different light because of that? \\- If I stay in SE, should I list my completed math classes in the education section of my resume? Will that be a differentiator?I'm enjoying SE, but if I can graduate earlier, that would also be great, and if they are relatively equivalent or if SE is somewhat worse, my only argument for staying in SE is that I'll be taking more classes and therefore possibly will learn more. Any advice on that is appreciated, thanks!",

        "content": "Really an open ended question.I finished university (Master) 1.5 years ago. Of course the difficulty between university problems and work problems is tangible for me. I am working as an embedded software engineer, I consider myself a 3/10 programmer (due to the fact that I just started working, and CS was not my degree). I can solve a problem (in due time), with some help of either colleagues, internet, or LLMs, but I reckon there are people (mostly on youtube) that are like a few levels above me, like 11-12/10, I can't follow their reasoning most of the time. Also some people's ability to read a problem for the first time, and immediately come up with the optimal solution, is astonishing, while I have to iterate multiple times, and not without errors.So I guess, my question is more for the people with some experience on their side, either in corporate or in startups, or for big personal projects. How do you become a better programmer and a better problem solver?I'm not looking only for answers like \"Read X book from Y\" (although they are appreciated), but I am looking for what changed your approach in programming, problem solving, that made you go from \"I am able to read some code, write normal/trivial functions\" to \"I can start from an idea and turn it into a functional program, with all its libraries/dependancies developed from scratch\".",

See FRED graph for the downtrend starting at that point and hasn't gone up since. Lets try to stick to the point of the post and not distract from the conversation over half a year.**All I constantly hear in this field is \"its cyclical\" and right now is part of a cycle. I am not aware of any other cycle in tech history where the job market has been this bad for this long. Its been nearly 4 years now of a horrible job market and it is only getting worse it seems.FRED data shows too that right now job posting are as bad if not worse than the worst part of the pandemic, when hardly anyone was hiring. That doesn't factor in all the new games that are being played, like posting of ghost jobs. Factor in that, and it is probably way worse.Also, jobs on the broader market just got revised down by almost a 1 million jobs today. Meaning, they overestimated the amount of jobs created by close to 1 million jobs.Meanwhile, companies \"still can't find qualified candidates\" and we continue to approve more and more visas in the US for mainly tech jobs. Nevermind the massive trend of now shipping jobs overseas or nearshore. Nevermind too the AI going on as well. Yes, I realize that much of the AI stuff is overhyped, but this sub is in denial if they think that hasn't affected hiring trends as well.I'm sorry, what is this jobs market anymore?

        "content": "I managed in 2022 to get a tech job with little experience (non-cs degree). I worked there for 3 years but have now been unemployed for 9 months. Admittedly, I didn't spend that whole time looking, but much of it I have been applying, interviewing, talking to recruiters, reaching out to friends, networking on linkedin, emailing people that are recommended to me, adding projects to my portfolio. I have been doing this constantly on a weekly basis for months. Nothing. I haven't even sniffed an offer. 95% of the time I just get rejection emails. Many of these positions I am 100% qualified for, literally every single thing on the bullet points is something I have experience in and is on my resume. I know I am qualified. I know that I did good work at my last job. I know I am smart... right?Lately I have been feeling like a complete and utter failure. Applying to jobs feels pointless since I never hear anything back. Even applying to similar positions to the one I left at the end of 2024 I get rejected for. Do I just forget my degree and go work as a waiter? Surely there are jobs out there but clearly no company wants to take me. I tend to think of myself as a capable and intelligent person with a good work ethic, but trying to find a job and watching my savings dwindle away has made me feel like I am worth nothing.I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess to vent. Maybe other people can understand my situation. I worked really hard to get my mental health to a good point over the last 5 years or so but lately I feel it slipping.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground. I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer. Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers. As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go. However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer. [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people. This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.] Here is some of my experiences.Working at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out. A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is. My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer. If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows. These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs. I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves. We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD. My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff. The cluster was owned and operated by someone else. But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services. There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out. There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box. But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves. This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer. My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team. At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else. Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included. The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales. But not everything was managed. So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points. This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time. Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job. So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as \"How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?\" were complete unknowns. We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch. Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly. They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options. So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down. So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that. My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company. But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding. The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it \"just worked\" without having to think about it too terribly much.This is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice. If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it. My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go. However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform. I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now. It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",

        "content": "**Original text:** Was interviewing a candidate today, she is from India (not my choice) - EDIT: SEE BELOW FOR WHAT I MEANT HERE. She has solid experience 5 years. We're trying to fill a full stack .net and angular role (once again, not my choice). We had three sessions - get to know you, framework and language knowledge, and then LC easy (13 - Roman numeral to integer) with screen sharing. She seems really stiff and nervous, but literally answers every question 100% accurately.For the knowledge section it would usually take her a couple stabs and seconds of silence to get to the right / correct answer.Me: \"What is the best data structure for storing 10 million records in memory?\" Her: \"A list or array but for that many records I think you should use a dictionary.\" Me: \"How would you handle a sql query that takes 30 seconds to return?\" Her: \"blah blah blah, pagination, blah blah blah.\" (in a follow up questions she finally got to indexes\" Me: \"What's SOLID\" Her: \\*literally lists of the entire acronym correctly with what it means\\*I'm really skeptical at this point she either has notes, or is using chatgpt on another monitor. I'm personally fine with this, because I find it pretty easy to sus out and honestly only do this section because it's required by our HR department (I told them I wanted to do a single 2 hour long session with two LCs and a live project collaboration and skip the knowledge check and they were like \"no, that's not how we do it.\" >(à¦­â¤ à¦­ \")<).Then we get to the LC. I share her a fiddle with the LC and tell her can use Visual Studio, or VS Code, or the fiddle - up to her. I tell her getting the solution isn't the important part - being able to explain her logic and thought process is. She then stumbles around with Visual Studio for like 3 minutes trying to create a solution, then switches to VS code - copies the fiddle into a FUCKING JAVASCRIPT FILE AND PROCEEDS TO RAW DOG THE C# WITHOUT SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN A JAVASCRIPT FILE. IN COMPLETE AWKWARD SILENCE TOO lol. I am floored. Is this cheating? Is she that nervous?But the problem with the cheating scenario is I can see her working through the problem like I would. I.e. first create a method to iterate the string and break it into chars, then a method where she used a switch to get the int value, then she put the check for the previous char is less than in a static method, etc.At the end, once again in complete fucking silence, she just dumps her javascript c# bastard child into the fiddle, runs it and gets the correct answer. I am so speechless at this. I ask her to explain her solution, which she does a decent job at and explains the business logic pretty well, then we drop from the interview.I use this same LC easy for pretty much every interview, and I literally have never seen such unhinged behavior in my life. My gut is telling me she just hates interviewing, but is secretly an interviewing chad and has done a TON of prep - but I also am out of the interviewee game - I haven't interviewed for a position since before COVID. Tell me, fellow gamers, is the cheating tech that good that it will tell you specifically how to fake reasoning out a solution? Or is it also giving nervousness / awkardness to you guys?**Edit**: I am leaving the original post body as to not receive criticism of secrecy. In my statement about the interviewee, I say \"*she is from India (not my choice)*\". What I meant by this is to say, I have no control over this decision - and to show that simplistic suggestions as \"just interview in person,\" won't work. Yes my company has an office in India that they could interview at, but there is nobody on my team or my boss' team that could do that for us. All five of my team leads are in N / S America. We do have employees on my team there, but they are all mid level. This is a senior role. I have in the past asked for support from other teams for this, but have been either ignored or told there isn't resources to support it.I personally fully support companies hiring everywhere in the world and employees being able to work everywhere in the world, at a good salary with no exploitation and nobody losing their jobs to accomplish this. Some of the best engineers I have ever worked with are Indian, both from collaborating across the world or as H1B on the path to green card and citizenship in the US. :India: :red_heart:Also, for this role, we cannot hire anywhere but in India as it is part of our companies expense budget for India. We are filling an open role from somebody who was already in India when I became manager of the team, who left some time ago. I can't go more into detail due to HR/Compliance reasons.I could have explained all of this above, yes, but I was already writing a really long post and wanted to just get to the point without detracting from it with a long winded explanation nobody could have wanted. Well here is the long winded explanation several have asked for.If you felt my comments about the interviewees ethnicity or national origin were offensive or mean - I apologize.Also for those that are wondering why I said (*once again, not my choice*) for .net / angular - yeah I fucking hate that shit. Eat :pile_of_poo: angular team and microsoft. /s - .net isnt as bad as PHP. angular isnt as bad as jquery was. \\*\\*shudders\\*\\*",

I'm not into reading about new frameworks and libraries. I'm not a guy who'd go to some tech meetups and talk about code. But I feel it's necessary to stay on track, aka keep your job. Especially in AI era. Big FOMO. On top of that I don't work super fast. Don't get me wrong, I sort of like programming - building things that solve real life things with code. However the satisfaction is not there when I do it for work. I feel so excited about pet side personal projects but I have no time to build them. Not gonna lie, having been through 2 layoffs made me very pessimistic. I was really happy-go-lucky after landing my first SWE job after internship. The layoffs and lack of stability taught me I'm nothing but a number in excel spreadsheet. And that I can do my best and still be laid off ruthlessly.I don't know if I can ever become a senior, an architect or a team lead. I feel like those positions are reserved for people who are super passionate. Any seniors or above here, who are not passionate about IT and don't do any IT related stuff after hours?",

        "author": "btzmacin",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a senior engineer (12 YOE), and a friend of the family's kid is a recent grad who, naturally, hasn't been able to land a job, given he didn't do any internships before graduating. His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.My plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market. He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.I think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky. Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.Even making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it. If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.While applying, I'd have him come up with a product. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating. What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience. To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow. Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.If he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper. Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one. Automate tasks at work with and without AI.Did I miss anything, or is anything above way off base? I don't want to scare the kid, but at the same time, this market is horrendous for seniors...I can't imagine having nothing but coursework on my resume right now.",

        "content": "Hey all, I've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about biasâit's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. Not saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.From my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. On the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more \"pass/fail\" mentalityâeither your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. I think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.Basically two styles: \"textbooker\" who want puzzle masters, vs. \"collaborative\" who prioritize discussion and personality.And don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others. Anyone else notice this trend? How do you handle it?",

Iâm about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech. I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.Any job Iâve ever had in tech, Iâve been a high performer. I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because Iâm any more skilled than anyone else (Iâm definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and Iâm a good communicator. I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.Iâm 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer. Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think Iâm doing my best. I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day. I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.This is the first time Iâve ever been anything but a star performer. I think Iâm letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think Iâm trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I donât genuinely feel like Iâm getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.Has anyone else ever dealt with this?

        "content": "Iâm an early-career frontend developer, and Iâve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.First, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.Apparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, Iâm feeling extremely frustrated because itâs the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:* Massive 2k+ LOC React components* Misuse of Context API for basically everything* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on \"mode\" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.Honestly, itâs just incredibly bad.I also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: \"Internal server error\" })` \\- lol* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)* No pagination in a logistics app* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebaseSo, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.Iâm considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I donât have a formal CS degree, Iâm worried about how itâll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I donât want to feel stuck in this mess forever.So my questions:1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase? Edit: Is the industry really in such bad shape? How come software engineers are paid so well when so many overlook even the basics?",

Overall I think we are moving just fine, but I will almost certainly burn out keeping things afloat on my own for a long period of time.Iâm already thinking if I just hold out a year I could move on to a new role.Any guidance to stay afloat or offload the pressure?Can I coast a bit and let the team just do what it can at its speed?This tech lead job is more like tech lead, senior engineer, engineer manager and product owner wrapped in one which is totally not something I know how to work with.",

I don't really know what to do anymore and there aren't really any in person support/study groups post grad for people trying to find jobs or whatever. I might try to transfer internally to a corporate IT technician role or something, which is also why I ask if anyone else has been in a similar situation.

She gets some equity too, but Iâm not sure the numbers.So my wife and I together currently have a TC of about ~$310,000 or so.If I take the FAANG offer, we will have to move which means my wife must quit her job. She will look for a new job, but we donât know how long that search would take or what level she would end up at after finding a job. We also have 2 young kids (both under 5 years old).The FAANG position would pay me much better than my current role, but it comes with risk:(1) My wife will be out of a job for awhile(2) FAANG layoffs happen all the time, and we would have to uproot our family and buy a house in the bay area. What if layoffs happen right after we move there? My current role - while paid much lower - is essentially guaranteed to not have layoffs (for at least another 2 years).I also work remote right now, so with this FAANG company Iâd be going in office.What do yall think?

So that ticket rolled over and I completed it. After that he told me that I \"was clearly struggling because I didn't commit my code\" on the first two requirements. Then last week he pulled me into a 1 on 1 with no notice, opened the repo to something I worked on a week earlier and asked what one specific line of code was doing. After looking at it for a couple minutes, I saw that it was a variable I had declared but never used, it didn't get noticed in code review either. He told me that this unused variable was another sign that I was struggling with the code base.I've never had a manager be this critical and I have over 10 years in tech, but this job is the biggest company (about 5000 people) that I've ever worked with. Do these issues sound like a big deal? The manager has been on the team less than a year and still doesn't know basics about our projects or who the people we work with from other teams are, so I think he might be setting me up for when someone over him sees that he's behind.",

The other engineer that started the same day as me had been working on different things, but seemed to do a lot more so far. I had been letting other engineers on my team know where I'm getting stuck, they would give me recommendations that I tried implementing, then I try using those and they don't work.

It's an easy to learn hard to master kind of language and you can do quite complex things. On the other hand, Java is old and there is alot of jobs for it CURRENTLY and it has a huge community and is used basically everywhere. But not a fan of syntax and it feels a bit clutteredI have actually learned alot of Go and really like it but I am wondering, if from job's perspective I should be learning Java since there is alot more scope?Maybe Devs in Java, Go can shed some light.

My question is, should I try to answer every question with a STAR (L) story?Obviously, questions like: \"describe a time ...\" or \"share an example\" should be answered in that format. But how about questions that don't necessarily indicate they're looking for a story? Ex: What do you do when you have a disagreement with someone on your team? How do you help a client figure out what they want when theyâre not sure? Tell me about how you balance deadlines with day-to-day responsibilities\\- my question for all of these questions is: Should I just respond back with how I do something or what I do? Or should I coming up with a scenario where I did that? Or, describe how I do it and then follow it up with a story describing when I did that?Tell me about a goal you achieved. \\- Another contrasting example, this one sounds different. It sounds like it's asking for a story. Thanks a lot!",

        "author": "theploop",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.Iâve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. Iâd say Iâm mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I canât really do right now for personal reasons.A friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that itâs less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication â which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.I did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and thereâs a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone arenât enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. Iâve also heard people say Dynamics can be âboringâ or ânot real programming,â but honestly, Iâm fine with that â stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.For context, Iâm currently in a financially good job, so Iâm not desperate to switch. But I donât want to stay stagnant either.So my questions are:â¢ Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?â¢ What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?â¢ Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?Would love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",

        "content": "Long story short there's been a lot of churn in my department recently and I've been all but offered a promotion to manager as I'm currently the only person left on the development team who has been with the company for more than a year, let alone the several I've been with the company for. I've indicated that I'm very interested in the position, however I'm worried I may have been a bit too eager in showing my interest as the salary of the position wasn't disclosed, would require that I change from full-remote to hybrid, and the company is generally known for giving lackluster at best raises/promotions. I'm already on the lower end of the payscale for my current role, so I have a feeling they're going to try lowballing me on the salary extra hard for the new position by just offering like a 15% bump (for reference the low end of the band for the new role in my area on glassdoor/indeed is more like a 40-50% bump compared to my current salary), which I feel wouldn't be worth it at all when taking into account the additional responsibilities, costs of commuting, and degraded work/life balance. Assuming that the company does lowball me and isn't willing to budge, how would you guys recommend I handle things? Respectfully decline the position despite previously showing great interest in it and take this as a sign to start looking for a new position, or just grit my teeth and accept the lowball offer and try to leverage the new title to get a new job somewhere offering a salary and benefits more in line with what appears to be industry standard after 3-6 months in the new role?",

        "content": "Context:I'm a Junior software engineer with about 2 years of experience and with no ops experience in my current position (mostly just React and Spring Boot developer work). I have started to dislike development work and wanted to pivot away from it. I'm not really sure at the moment what I want to do, but had an interest in trying for an infra / ops role.I somehow managed to stumble upon and receive an offer for a \"Cloud Engineer\" position. Upon learning more about the position the role and research, the role seems to be like a Platform Engineer. Essentially I would be working on the company's Internal Developer Portal (IDP) powered by Backstage helping to research new developer tooling, supporting new pipelines, and helping to modernize and onboard applications teams to the platform. I believe another term for this would be building out a \"low code\" internal cloud platformI have no connections that have experience working with IDPs so wanted to take a shot in the dark and seek out any engineers in this area of work or have worked adjacently with it and ask the following questions:1. Am I pigeonholing myself to a certain niche in this kind of role? How applicable does work in this kind of position apply to other DevOps roles?2. In your experience how difficult has it been getting application teams to transition to this kind of platform?3. Is this an upcoming way of approaching and accelerating enterprise app deployment or has this been a relatively niche approach to maintaining infrastructure and operations that only certain companies pilot?Any help on this would be appreciated as I have literally never seen this sort of position even within my current company.",

Or if itâs a bad look to be applying so soon after getting hired.The other side of the coin being that having a job makes you a more desirable candidate or allows you to have more negotiating power. Also, because it isnât SWE experience, I just wonder if it will even be considered applicable experience. Job requirement has me coding maybe 40% of the time according to job posting. Iâm still onboarding so I donât actually know all of what I will be doing. I only have internship and this experience.",

I'm now determined to transition into robotics, even if it means going back to school for a masters, but I'm looking into other options to hopefully save time and money while still providing reasonable opportunities for me to land a job in the field. I have some experience with arduinos and pis, but I'm pretty much a beginner in this space.I came across this course https://www.theconstruct.ai/robotics-developer/ which looks promising if it could help me get a solid internship with a company, but was curious if others had recommendations for making this jump. I'm at the point where I'm planning to leave my current position in about 6 months and work on getting the needed education/portfolio full time until I land a new position. I want to fully commit to this rather than slowly transition over the course of a couple years. With that being said, what are some options for transitioning into robotics as a career for someone who is already working in software? Anyone here working in robotics now that was previously full stack? Would love to hear any insights on this.",

It was previously understood that you really don't need a Master's for an entry level role in CS, but getting one could mean a nice increase in pay compared to those with just a Bachelors. But now I am seeing more people applying for entry-level positions with a Master's. I believe we are reaching a point where having a Master's is the bare minimum for post-grad job hunting. What do you guys think? I haven't heard much back besides a couple of OAs since graduating with my Bachelors in CS earlier this year in May, and I think this silent shift might have to do something about it. Not saying it isn't possible to get an entry-level role with only a Bachelor's, but from a company point of view, are you going to hire someone with a Bachelor's over a Master's? Love to know your guy's opinions on this, not a topic I see discussed a lot.",

This class does all the work (updates tables, generates the PDF, calls the web API, etc), all I really do is feed it the string for the body of the email. Even when I am creating new processes, it is mostly just sticking together these already existing classes.
