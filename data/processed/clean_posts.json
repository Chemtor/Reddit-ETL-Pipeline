        "content": "I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.What’s changed?Why are companies acting like jerks?Last week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”Seriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?Here’s what I’ve noticed:* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.Do you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?I’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\\-----\\[EDIT\\]I'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",

        "content": "I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:- Application scalability, availability, and security.- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. I've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *\"Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.\"*However, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.Data lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?Even simple stuff like \"what is a 'feature'?\" took some time to wrap my head around. *\"Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?\"*Anyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering. When they wander into your lane and start stepping on your toes, try not to get too upset.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.Your work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.LLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.So the danger isn’t the model. **It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.** Or their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.” Or a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.You won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.” The next few years look the same: Industry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning— Still out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.# How you can win this fight Right now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.The most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.It’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago. And now it’s your turn.You don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.**Be the scout.** The one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. It’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…” → Yes, and let’s do it safely. → Yes, and let’s make the most of it. → Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.But “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” \"falling behind\" \"missed opportunity\" \"company risk\". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.So don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.Frame it as: **“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**That’s who companies want. That’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in. And while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps you guys keep your jobs.",

Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.That's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.Now the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.It's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.Rant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.TLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything",

I have zero clue of what to do or where to start. My SQL skills would be somewhere between beginner and intermediate. How should I go about setting the data quality checks and data transformation? Is there any particular resource that I could refer to, because I think I might have seen the DBT core tutorial on the DBT website a while back but I see only DBT cloud tutorials now. How do you approach the DBT stage?",

We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.And two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.To make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. We are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance. Would like not having to spin up a full lakehouse or manage Flink.Any thoughts or insights that can help us get out of this mess?EDIT - Fixed typo.",

So far, I've managed to ingest data from the different databases I have access to and land everything into the bronze layer.Now I'm moving on to data quality checks and cleanup, and that’s where I’m hitting a wall. I’m familiar with the general concepts of data validation and cleaning, but up until now, I’ve only applied them on relatively small and simple datasets.This time, I’m dealing with multiple databases and a large number of tables, which makes things much more complex. I’m wondering: is it possible to automate these data quality checks and the cleanup process before promoting the data to the silver layer?Right now, the only approach I can think of is to brute-force it, table by table—which obviously doesn't seem like the most scalable or efficient solution.Have any of you faced a similar situation? Any tools, frameworks, or best practices you'd recommend for scaling data quality checks across many sources?Thanks in advance!",

What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.Where I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.However, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view. Today, counting a year and a half of internship, I'm going on three and a half years in data engineering.Anyway, what do you think?",

        "content": "I come from a self taught background, and have been in my F200 “Data engineer” role for about a year. I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.Then through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.Fast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasksNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.I guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated. I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who has felt out of their depth in early-ish career.",

This will get you a seat at the table with more important business stakeholders.I had a lot of hope that I would develop this type of domain knowledge, but I ended up just being assigned data platform work or data ingestion work where domain knowledge is almost not required Even after asking to be moved to positions that provide this kind of experience, I am not provided with those opportunities.",

The issue is, there’s no open row-oriented data format that lets you use any query engine - Postgres, MySQL, etc. - on the same data directly.The challenge of designing such a format is obvious, and it would take tremendous effort to get mainstream databases to adopt it. The bigger question is: is there even strong demand for such a format?

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.I am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3. If I choose s3, can I store the data in s3 tables instead of csv or parquet and what would be the advantage of it?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I work at a large organization that follows the medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold) for our data lake. We ingest data into the bronze layer from a wide variety of sources: APIs, Excel files, third-party applications, etc. Because of this diversity, we struggle with establishing consistent naming conventions.For example, many datasets don’t have a straightforward business concept like `CustomerSales` or `OrderDetails`. Some are operational logs, others are reference datasets or ad hoc data pulls. This makes it hard to define a universal naming strategy.In the gold layer, we use standard prefixes like `dim_` and `fact_` where applicable, but we often have tables that don’t neatly fall into dimension or fact categories. These are still critical to downstream consumption but are harder to categorize and name.I'm looking for:* Examples of naming conventions you’ve successfully applied in medallion architectures.* Resources or documentation that helped your organization design naming standards.* Tips for balancing flexibility and consistency when working with heterogeneous data sources.Any advice or pointers would be appreciated!Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hey everyone!We just released an open-source Airflow provider that solves a problem we've all faced - getting reliable alerts when DAGs fail or don't run on schedule. Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.With just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (\"did the nightly job run?\") and execution health (\"did it finish within 4 hours?\"). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings: from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout... dag = DAG(\"nightly_dag\", ...) # Enable tracking with one line! enable_telomere_tracking(dag)It integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.Check out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.Would love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",

        "title": "Dreaming of Graphs in the Open Lakehouse",
        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**TLDR:**I’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).Regarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.HugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).This is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",

When he was in my place he decided to use Talend with Redshift. He's quite proud of this, and wants every pipeline to use Talend.My fellow engineers have found workarounds that minimize our exposure to it, and are basically using it for orchestration only, so the boss is happy.We finally have a new use case, which will be, as far as I can tell, the first streaming pipeline we'll have. I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”. (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).Of course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing. I'm fine with using it to shift from S3 to Redshift to keep him happy, but would appreciate some examples of why not to use Talend streaming over MSK.Thank you in advance r/dataengineering community!",

        "title": "Architecture advices on AWS",
        "author": "Adrien0623",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey!I recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.In my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.Here’s a high-level overview of the current setup:- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).While this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.To address this, I’m considering the following changes:- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.Given the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?Thanks a lot!",

The manual classification process was becoming unsustainable: slow, inconsistent, and impossible to scale.Instead of spinning up Python-based NLP pipelines or fine-tuning models, we tried something surprisingly simple: **Snowflake Cortex's** `CLASSIFY_TEXT()` function directly in SQL.A simple example: SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT( 'Delivery was fast but support was unhelpful', ['Product', 'Customer Service', 'Delivery', 'UX'] ) AS category; We took it a step further and plugged this into a scheduled task to automatically label incoming feedback every week. Now the pipeline runs itself, and sentiment and category labels get applied without any manual touchpoints.It’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s consistent, fast, and gets us 90% of the way with near-zero overhead.If you're working with survey data, CSAT responses, or other customer feedback streams, this might be worth exploring. Happy to answer any questions about how we set it up.Here’s the full breakdown with SQL code and results: [https://open.substack.com/pub/cloudwarehouseweekly/p/cloud-warehouse-weekly-special-edition?r=5ltoor&utm\\_campaign=post&utm\\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false](https://open.substack.com/pub/cloudwarehouseweekly/p/cloud-warehouse-weekly-special-edition?r=5ltoor&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) Is anyone else using Cortex in production?

        "author": "Existing-Mousse3509",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.I'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.To give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.Now, about the two offers:On one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.However, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.The second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of \"Data Scientist Analyst\", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.The positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.That’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.So I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.Again, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",

It uses Apache DataFusion under the hood for columnar processing, so you get Spark-like performance on a single machine.**Key features:*** All the Deequ validation patterns (completeness, uniqueness, statistical, patterns)* 100MB/s single-core throughput* Built-in OpenTelemetry for monitoring* 5-minute setup: just `cargo add term-guard`**Current limitations:*** Rust-only for now (Python/Node.js bindings coming)* Single-node processing (though this covers 95% of our use cases)* No streaming support yetGitHub: [https://github.com/withterm/term](https://github.com/withterm/term) Show HN discussion: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44735703](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44735703)**Questions for this community:**1. What data validation do you actually do today? Are you using Deequ/Great Expectations, custom scripts, or just hoping for the best?2. What validation rules do you need that current tools don't handle well?3. For those using dbt - would you want something like this integrated with dbt tests?4. Is single-node processing a dealbreaker, or do most of your datasets fit on one machine anyway?Happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation. Also very open to feedback on what would make this actually useful for your pipelines!",

Specifically we’re using the column SystemModStamp (only option on Stitch), so everyday we’re just extracting SystemModStamp >= last value. However, an issue arises with calculated field on Salesforce. For example, table A’s X field is just looking up the X field on table B. When we update X field on table B, table B will get a new SystemModStamp but table A won’t. So when we sync the data, table B will have correct data on Snowflake but table A won’t. I have identified 2 potential solutions 1. Full table replication: will have correct data but costly 2. Rebuild Salesforce logic: can use dbt to rebuild the logic but will take too much time Has anyone faced similar issues? What are your solutions? Thank you so much!",

I currently have a dictionary object that I just set some first level data in. I save this dictionary object several times as a file up in a bucket. This tracks information about the process such asa. did i log into the API successfullyb. how much data is availablec. how much data did i download successfullyd. did the api report any license changes when queried.This is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. I then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room. I dont save the metrics in another datasource.However i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs. And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. I am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database. I have GCP so i can use pub sub, I also have access to a simple postgresdb to publish to. I do like that my stack is simple (json file to bucket) but i also know that I am not getting information that I want.Thoughts on how I could improve on this? I dont mind adding something to the stack to support it. Adding something like Sentry would be my last choice at the moment as I am trying to keep the reporting stack closer in house. I am mostly looking for nice incremental improvements I can make that aren't re-stacking everything.A few other notes\\- These are cronjobs running in a linux box\\- No airflow, airbyte, dagster in the stack at the moment",

My original plan was to use an AWS Lambda and configure Event Source Mapping to automatically invoke the Lambda when new events are written to the Kinesis stream. However, I've started wondering if this will cause performance issues as this could end up creating 120+ connections (1 invocation per shard, I have 30+ streams which each have 4 shards) to Postgres. One option could be to use RDS Proxy or PgBouncer. However, I think the \"easier\" solution could be to just write a continuously running script that creates a psycopg ConnectionPool and just run this in ECS as a service.How would you solve this?

Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.Right now, I'm focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality. I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.### What's inside:* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing### Known limitations:* Not memory-efficient (yet)* Feature set is evolving### Links:* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)* Docs:  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)  or  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)I'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!Thanks!",

I dont want to disregard all the smaller values though so I was thinking a weighted average would be appropriate here.Im writing this in SQL and have tried a couple different methods that have produced varying results: (sum_last_30_day_usage - sum_30_to_60_day_usage) / ((sum_last_30_day_usage + sum_30_to_60_day_usage) / 2.0) ((sum_last_30_day_usage - sum_30_to_60_day_usage) / NULLIF(sum_30_to_60_day_usage, 0)) *LN((sum_last_30_day_usage + sum_30_to_60_day_usage) + 1)Is there maybe an industry standard for this type of problem?",

I wasn’t expecting big changes because they were busy with coursework and exam prep and didn’t have much time to practice between sessions. To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.This experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials. I used to think problem-solving was different that you had to grind endlessly to “figure it out.” In college, I spent countless hours on Codeforces (eventually reaching ~1900 rating and I remember feeling soo excited) and told others, including my brother to just practice more. Looking back, I wish I had given better advice not just solely focusing on practicing a lot of questions but thinking and improving the approach we take for solving any problem",

However, he is still pretty young and doesn't have a computer yet. I am looking for gift ideas that will encourage and tap into that \"coding desire\" but aren't necessarily \"learning to code\" yet. These can be games, books or anything of the sort, maybe even android apps but it would be nicer if it was something physical. So far the only thing i've really thought of is redstone books / guides so he can do some minecraft logic. However, I would prefer something more physical. These don't need to be directly coding related but anything that will stimulate that tinkerer, programmer, problem solving mind. Bonus if it is coding related but I'd settle for something that scratches the programming itch. I know of scratch, but as he doesn't have a computer, I think ill save that one for a little later when he does.edit: Whoa, this blew up fast. Thanks everyone for your answers, there are some great suggestions.. including just getting him a computer (which I agree - but I have to convince his mum on that one first!). I am going to go through everything suggested and see if there's some we can do together and some for him to do on his own. Haven't decided on anything yet but there are some wonderful suggestions, might be coming back to this list for his birthday next year too!",

Any advice is much appreciated also ;) thanks",

In second semester, we learnt Object Oriented Programming with Java and I knew I had to do better so I put in a lot of effort (obviously not just for good grade) and received an A and put in a lot of effort in my project (made a game) and the teacher was pretty impressed and gave me full marks but now that summer has started I still feel like I need to go deeper in it because I feel like everything I've learnt is basically halfway even though I've put in a lot of effort. I'm really confused as to if I should work on my OOP projects or if I should start DSA as it's my course next semester. How do people just excel certain areas throughout one semester ?? any guidance ?",

        "content": "Now, I may be biased because I'm all for learning to code, but holy Christ the amount of times that I have given AI a chance, it has done nothing but hurt me emotionally. I have NO IDEA how those \"no-code\" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.So, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. \"Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each element in it's own little border side-by side\". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. \"They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code\". I paste the supposedly \"corrected code\" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, \"Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version\", and it's not the correct version.Another example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of \"seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?\" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating. How does someone who knows NOTHING do this and not go crazy?",

Sure, I could just not use AI, but who is really going to choose to be less productive, especially at work where everyone else is using it?It doesn’t feel the same anymore. The craftsmanship of coding feels like it is dying. I used to spend hours reading documentation, slowly building something through rigorous testing and tweaking, enjoying every part of the process. Now I just prompt and paste. There is zero fulfillment. When people talk about AI replacing programmers, most worry about losing their jobs. That doesn’t worry me, because someone will still have to prompt and fix AI-generated code. For me it’s about losing the joy of building something yourself.Does anyone else feel this way?

How can people argue like this when there are literally thousands of conflicting opinions online about what should be **basic** OOP stuff?In math, you have a **clear** definition. In geometry, you have **clear** definitions of theorems, axioms, and so on. But in programming? Everything feels so vague, like I’m in a philosophy or theology lecture, not studying a field where precision should be the highest priority.Seriously — **where’s the original source of truth** for this? Something I can point to and say: “Yes, THIS is the correct definition, because that’s what X says.”",

However, I’m unsure what the job landscape looks like for this path:•What kinds of jobs typically involve low-level programming (outside of the usual embedded/firmware developer roles)?•Are there realistic remote opportunities in this field? Or is most of the work tied to physical labs/offices due to hardware access?•Any tips on what kinds of projects or skills I should build to get my foot in the door?I’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or resources from people already working in this space.

So far I’ve picked up some HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. One of my older cousins told me that if I get really good at those, it could be enough to land a job. So I stuck with it.But while trying to learn JS, I kept seeing videos and posts saying stuff like “do CS50 first before anything else.” So I started that, and I’m about 3 weeks in now. And honestly... it’s kinda overwhelming. There’s just so much info, and everyone seems to have a different opinion on what you should do or learn first. It’s hard to know what actually matters.My goal is pretty simple: I just want a remote job in some decent western country. Even if it pays minimum wage (like $15k/year in the US or something), that would still be a big deal for me. I live in a third world country, and things aren’t great financially. I really want to help my family out as soon as I can.But yeah, I just don’t know what I should be doing right now to actually get closer to that. People keep telling me I’m young and not to stress but I am stressed. I think about the future too much. If anyone has any advice on what to focus on or how to move forward from here, I’ll really appreciate it",

Do I copy and paste that code into specific software to make an application? Where do I put this code next to do anything meaningful? It seems useless in PyCharm. I want to “action” it. I’ve watched a ton of YouTube videos and can run regression analysis and do basic strings/variables that provide info within PyCharm. But if I wanted to program a simple rock, paper, scissors game into a website, then what do I do with the code? Is this where mobile application software and website design software come in? Do I paste this code into this type of software to actually “create the game”? And not just have it spit out random variables (Rock, paper, or scissors) in PyCharm? My current knowledge (which is probably wrong) is that:1. You download a programming language2. You write the code3. You run it within a developer environment (PyCharm for example)4. Once tested in PyCharm — you run that code in another software that will “bring it to life”Step 4 has me co dosed as hell.

        "author": "tree332",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. I had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.In linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor. I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems, but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \\*any\\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation. In discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me. In intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.I ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.I have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school. I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year, but I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS degree curriculum on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.When I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. when I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as \"how to draw a 2d triangle program\" opens up a new journey learning the opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.I have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. I then go back to an \"intro to java/python/c# course\" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.I'm not quite sure how to move forward.",

Eventually, I turned it into a short book.A few ideas it covers:* How to evolve a system without turning it into spaghetti* Safer ways to deserialize and construct your data* Turning input validation into something the compiler helps with* Where generics shine — and where they secretly hurt you* Treating time/space complexity as part of the interface contract* Making failure obvious and early instead of quiet and delayedIt’s all freely available — just a public repo on GitHub.If that sounds interesting, I’d be genuinely happy to hear what you think.",

I don't have a job in programming, only have 1 major project under my belt, and I still have a lot to learn.Now for my advice that I wished I knew when I started out: code by discipline, not by inspiration.What do I mean by this? Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.Anyways, that's my advice. What do you guys think of it? I hope this helps someone out starting coding!",

I’ve forgotten most of them. :grimacing_face:I’m all ears. Trying to stay chill, but definitely sweating inside. :grinning_face_with_sweat:Thanks in advance!",

        "author": "mosahel",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello,Just to clarify, I started with programming and all this tech stuff at the very beginning of 2024. I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.Then I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.I’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.So now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.Right now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects? I really want to make the most of this last year so I don’t end up with no job at the end, but I could use some advice—even just on what to learn, what order to tackle things, or how to structure my study time.If anyone’s been in a similar situation, or has tips for making the most of this final stretch—whether it’s about Java, backend projects, passing those backlogs, or handling the stress of not knowing what’s next—I’d really appreciate any guidance.Thank you!",

The more I try to become better, the more I realize the biggest issue is: I really don’t know how to break down big problems into smaller ones, know how to specify what kind of functions/ datatypes I will use, and solve the problem. I’ve just been learning the syntax, never deeply dove down to the core of the problem, and relying on ai when there are parts I dont know how to fix. And to make things worse, I really dont know how to practice these things.

        "content": "I often see 2 recurring approaches to solving the problem of resource management between services/managers/classes/what-have-you (I'll be referring to them as managers henceforth):1. Dependency injection. This is as straightforward as it gets. If a manager needs access to a resource, just pass it into the constructor.2. Service location. This is a pattern whereby managers, after initialization, are registered into a centralized registry as pointers to themselves. If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.Here's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location? Also, you can suggest another approach if necessary.Any help or guidance is absolutely appreciated!",

        "author": "AnEdgeLordWeeb",

        "content": "Hey guys!Before I begin, I would like to sincerely thank all of you for taking your time to read and respond to my post - your help truly means a lot to me!Let me start by telling a bit about myself; I'm currently a junior Data Engineer, working in a firm based in the EU - the first job I've ever had since graduating with my bachelor's last summer. I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.Over this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.The stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.I won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.That said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.So now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:What books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a \"cracked developer\"? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.Through this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.As I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",

        "content": "Hello,I graduated this past June with a bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems. I’m aiming to get into front end web dev / software dev, but I’m seeing how tough it is for new grads with no experience. I'm honestly just hoping to land any position that relates to my degree now.The only job I’ve had is working at Burger King for a year. I know I messed up not doing internships during school. Skill-wise, I know HTML, CSS, some basic JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I’ve been working through The Odin Project but I’m only around halfway through the Foundations section. It’ll probably take me well into next year to finish the whole curriculum and ideally I’d like to be working before then.I know this kind of post probably shows up here a lot, and I’ve done a bit of googling and researching already. I guess I just want to feel more certain about what all my options really are, given my situation and in todays market (since it seems to shift around quickly).After researching, I'm wondering if I should just get my A+ cert and try to land a help desk job for now. I’d honestly prefer not to go that route, but if it’s the most realistic way to get a foot in the door, I’ll do it.So basically I’m wondering: – Is it still worth trying to get an internship now, even after graduating? – Are there other entry-level roles besides help desk that I can realistically land with my degree + skills in 2025? – Given where I’m at, what should I focus on most right now?Any advice or personal experience would be really appreciated. Just trying to get a better sense of direction. Thanks",

However, we have never written unit tests for the Java code. Was thinking to write unit tests on the Java methods that help support the Gherkin Syntax to catch any issues with our Gherkin integration tests, such as false positives, , ensure the syntax is working as intended, etc., but is that a good practice?Maybe I am overthinking it. I guess we can write unit tests for anything if we want to, but also not sure if we are writing tests for tests in this case, which I think might be a bad practice. It's more of tests for the Java code that allows QA to write the integration tests. I have only seen unit tests for a service's or library's functionality, but not for the tests in a way so was having some doubts.",

I just realized this means my API keys are completely exposed for anyone to see in the \"View Page Source,\" which is a huge security risk.I need to fix this for my existing tools and also learn how to build my new tools correctly from the start. But honestly, I have zero experience building a \"proper\" backend with something like Node.js or PHP from scratch.So, my main question is: **For a beginner on a WordPress site, what's the simplest way to handle this securely?**1. **Can I do this inside WordPress itself?** Like, is it a good idea to use a PHP snippet in my theme's `functions.php` file to create a simple, secure endpoint? Or is there a trusted plugin for this?2. I've also heard about **\"serverless\"** tools like Cloudflare Workers or Netlify Functions. Are those a good fit for a beginner? Can they even work with an existing WordPress site just for these specific tasks?3. If you have any **links to guides or tutorials** for someone in my exact situation, that would be amazing.Any pointers you can give would be a massive help. Thanks so much for reading!",

But my peers have been focusing on DSA and building a good CodeForces rating and participating in competitive coding to get a good placement at the end of of college. I tried doing this but haven't been able to stay on track. I know that knowledge of data structures and algorithms is necessary and needed in cybersec too but I feel like I should focus more on ctf and knowing tools and doing something practical and learn things as I go. But I fear I might be wrong and the way I think might not be the way to go. I need experienced advice on how should I proceed ahead. I am interested in lot of things right now like low-level programming and how operating systems and native application work, web development and exploitation, and networking related stuff and even some quantitative finance as it requires low-level knowledge too.

        "author": "FredWeitendorf",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)Let me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may \"know\" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.Number one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?Number two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.Third most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they \"get it\"? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.None of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.Here are a few common examples:* Sending very flowery, \"fake personalized\", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to \"stand out\" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.*** Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**What these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**(cont. below: what to do instead)",

On top of that, the May and June numbers were revised. 19,000 jobs were added in May and 14,000 jobs were added in June. Presumably next month or in September we will see revisions to the July numbers and they will be cut as well. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer increased to 1.83 million from 1.65 million in June. A lot of people have been making posts lately saying this sub is just doom-and-gloom and the market is better than what people here are saying, but the numbers speak for themselves.

        "author": "sirlifehacker",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just spent the last few days writing a small scraper that pulled **527 active “AI Engineer / Research Engineer / ML” roles** from LinkedIn, Wellfound and a few private talent boards.After cleaning the dupes and mapping salaries to USD, the list only kept roles that pay **$180k – $550k total comp** (base + equity).Here are three quirks that jumped out to me (but may have been obvious to you):# 1. People who can move models from “demo” to “live” get paid the mostNearly three-quarters of roles put “make it run in production” skills ahead of pure math or paper writing.* About 40% flat-out ask if you’ve ever taken a notebook proof-of-concept and turned it into a real web service that can handle thousands of user requests per second. If you can turn a cool model into a button ordinary users click you jump straight into the top salary tier.# 2. Series-B companies outbid Big Tech* The median cash + equity offers at **30-150-person, Series-A/B startups** was **$308K** – which actually turned out to be 16% higher than FAANG-level postings in the same sample.* My take-away? Chasing a brand name may actually cap your upside right now... the hotter money is in venture-backed startups racing to productize.# 3. They want applicants with a public footprint* More than half of the roles demanded a public Github, Kaggle gold or published paper.* Several even ask you to attach **“relevant Colab / HF Space links”** instead of a cover letter. Y**our next project GitHub repo or HuggingFace demo is a résumé multiplier** so make sure it's polished.If you want to dive deeper I posted a YouTube video with the dataset linked in the description. Let me know if you want the link so I don’t break sub rules.Hope these data points help you steer your learning / job search – curious what other patterns people spot",

(opportunity to work with cloud tech when company has no plan for them, code review/cicd when I'm the only developer and this company doesn't care about standards)3 yoe Update: I ended up staying after they sent me the conditions above in writing (100k + upto 15k bonus + 2 - 3 day remote) and promoted me to a senior. They are also looking to integrate a major CRM solution and will provide the resources to certify me. I think overall it makes sense for me to stay.",

I don't really want to work at a FAANG company, and I don't really need huge TC. I'm pretty content to work at a smaller company that isn't doing anything in the AI realm, a company that makes \"boring\" software with a \"boring\" tech stack.Does anyone know what that world is like right now? I'd be pretty content to take an $80k/year TC package doing, say, PHP if it meant I didn't have to go through months of screenings and assignments competing with 200 other resumes. Or are even the small companies inundated with applicants, doing 4+ rounds of interviews for mid-level positions?Thanks!",

At least for now. But I can tell they are trying to ratchet up how much output they get from me for pay that simply isn't worth the extra demands they want from me. Also, the stories are being pointed and written by a non-technical person. I don't see myself lasting here for more than a year more.All I want is a normal job like I had at the second company I worked out. It was a good culture where workers were open to helping each other do well. No toxic boss or pushing for deadlines that were unrealistic. I do not want FAANG salaries nor do I want FAANG work hours. I just want a normal 8-5 job and log off. No on calls either. No toxic managment and realistic deadlines. I will take a pay cut if needed for this.Where can I find a job like this? Or is this industry really over at this point and I should start making plans to go elsewhere. I hope not, given how much time I have put improving in this field.",

I mostly see senior, architect, and consultant jobs.\\- Why are Salesforce salaries so high? I'm still in shock and awe at how much a Salesforce Dev can make -- it's comparable to traditional software engineering roles. I still have a hard time believing it, it's so wild.\\- Are certifications actually as valuable as they say? I do like that Salesforce has created an upward mobility ladder, in a sense, for their platform. Which is unheard of other than with your typical IT certs like Cisco and such.\\- Has anyone else switched from a traditional software development job and into Salesforce? And if so, how was your experience?\\- Overall, is being a Salesforce Dev still worth getting into? Or should I try to get back into web development?Thank you all!",

After graduation, I completed an unpaid full-stack internship, which was mainly frontend development. Since then, I’ve been actively applying to jobs across different types of companies including startups, large firms, remote, on-site and hybrid roles. Despite sending out around 50-70 applications a day, I rarely hear back. Ive even been reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, and barely anything.I’ve revised my resume countless times. I’ve learned Spring Boot and am currently working on a backend project to showcase that. I also practice LeetCode daily.Out of desperation, I joined mthree in June, which is supposed to be a training-to-placement program, but they haven’t started training me yet. Feels like a waste of my time.Atp I feel like im doomed and unemployable. I've applied for QA, support, SWE, data scientist, even HR and solutions engineer. I just dont get it.For context, I’m applying throughout the U.S. and a bit in Canada (dual citizen).What the hell do I even pivot into atp? Ive already tried applying for adjacent tech roles.Edit 1: Since people are commenting on the 50-70 jobs, I know 50-70 sounds intense but I apply to jobs in both Canada and USA. I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to. I also avoid easy apply and apply directly on sites.Edit 2: Here is my resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adhrvKm0kb0D_pN9hHNyOuiS30Tti5w/view?usp=sharingSome comments regarding my resume:My resume is a simple Word document. I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.Edit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:1. Contribute to open-source projects2. Bold technologies in projects/internships3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)4. Get rid of mthree experience5. Reduce technical skills6. Remove GPA7. Stick to applying locally and not country-wide or cross country because they will filter you out.",

For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.During my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.Lately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.Here's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I'll be looking into doing a Master's program and getting internships that way. I'll also try to monetize my app and leverage my skills to see if I can start turn it into a business.",

        "content": "Just curious if it's appropriate to use linkedin job offers to ask for a raise. I am fairly confident in my abilities and I think I perform better than my peers. Never struggled to find a job (only had 3 software dev jobs in my 20 years career so far though).I have been at my current company for 10 years now. I asked for a significant raise once about 5 years ago because I realized I was paid less than a colleague even though I was the lead. Other than that I usually get the usual 3% salary bump every year, nothing significant.Ideally I would prefer to stay at my job. I like the job, my coworkers and the company. But it's always a challenge to know I could be making that much more (and they also offer 2 more weeks of vacation per year) elsewhere. Both jobs are 100% remote, so no change there.So basically my question is, what is the norm out there? Is it \"too much\" to ask for a significant salary raise again if I asked for one (and got it) 5 years ago?",

I’m obviously not mid-level, but they seem interested in me and are moving me through the process, presumably for a junior version of the role.I’ve heard startup hours can be rough (nights/weekends), so I’d like to be fairly compensated if that’s the expectation. Initially, I was thinking of asking for $80k based on general new grad ranges, but now I’m wondering if that’s too low given the posted range.How should I think about a fair ask? I don’t want to price myself out, but I also don’t want to undersell myself if they’re offering more demanding hours and I’m filling an actual business need.

I ended up working in technical presales (very strong focus on AI Platform) for 1.5 years and realized having a sales-oriented role is not really my thing, and I was risking building a career that could only lead to commercial roles, so I decided to look for software engineer openings internally and externally.Found an opening for A DIFFERENT big tech role in AI software engineering (based in EU, Eastern Europe) and decided to pursue that opportunity. I am quite happy with my choice, but most of the managers discussed this choice with are telling me that AI will come to replace many SWEs and I need to consider this, as if they're saying 'you messed up with this one'.I mean, they're people that do not really come from engineering and spent their life in salesy roles but these words combined with the gloomy outlook I'm seeing here online have me concerned that I should have just swallowed my dislike for business talks and stick to my already privileged position, even if it's not aligned to my liking and the career path I imagine myself pursuing.What do you think?

My second manager made an 8 point per sprint requirement and said I didn’t have to do it, then it became a performance issue when I didn’t do it. Very confused. Now the thing is I “ask too many questions” and am not technically independent. I’m tired. I do all my stories. I never caused carry over or even a defect. I always take notes after asking a question so I never ask the same question twice. I have multiple certs. Was in a hackathon. If I’m struggling so much, how am I completing all my work before the deadline? When I ask a question, I always say what I tried first. I never ask without trying and saying what I tried because that’s annoying. I don’t communicate well with my tech lead because he always gets irritated very quickly towards me. Use to laugh and snap at me when I code constantly. Didn’t want to deal with that so I route questions elsewhere.Had multiple managers and they’re just like “oh if you just do x (replace x with study outside of work, try before asking a question, say what you tried before asking a question), then they’ll be nicer to you”. Like….ok….havent I been doing that for a year straight?And apparently performance reviews aren’t based on actual goals, but vibes. No one has given me goals yet. I don’t pass my tech leads vibe check so all feedback from him is negative. I don’t know what they want from me. How do I even improve at this point? I study outside of work, I use ai, like…do I just suck at my job? Do I suck at this field? I don’t get it. Went to hr, they said “sounds like you’re just complaining that you have to do your work.” I can get another job, but is that best? Is this a team specific problem? I think tech is cool, but is my brain just not cut for this?",

I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.I doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",

        "content": "I recently joined a large bank in Europa that was on a massive hiring spree, bringing in over 500 new developers.My interviews and job offer were all centered around Java, React, SQL, and general web development.I have 4 years of experience, I'm married with no children. The work environment is relaxed, the pay is good, and the culture seems positive.After being benched for the first month without a project, I was finally assigned to a data project in my second month.The problem is, no one on this team has a background in Java or web development. Everyone is focused on AI and data, working with Python, ETLs, BigQuery, and DBT.And in addition to that, they put me in a role of QA even though I don't have any type of experience with Python or QA.I'm pretty unhappy with this decision because it doesn't align with my career goals and experience. I really want to continue working with Java. I brought up my discomfort to my manager during my first week on the project.He told me the priority was getting people onto projects and asked me to give it some time, telling me to keep him updated (he was not clear about these updates).I'm still on this squad and still unhappy. Everything feels very rigid and data-centric. Meanwhile, friends who joined the company at the same time as me are all in squads doing pure Java, React and overall web development.Am I being immature or unreasonable for feeling dissatisfied? Every day seems like a brick to carry.Should I wait another two months and then talk to my manager again? How should I approach him this time?Any advice would be very helpful.",

Honestly, I’m a bit confused and unsure what to believe. I’ve talked to people about this and have received mixed results. I’ve talked to two professors who believe that the thought of AI completely replacing programmers is nonsense although it is still a very useful tool. On the other hand, I have family members that work in IT that believe that programming jobs as we know it are basically over.I’m also planning to double major in CS and Applied Math. I’m hoping that the math degree could give me some flexibility and open up other career options in case the CS job market remains difficult, what are your guys thoughts on that?Am I overthinking this? Is CS still worth pursuing given the current trends?Also im not sure if this is the right place to ask this type of question. If its not what other subs should I ask?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I started at a company on a dev team a few months ago. This is my first permanent job after completing my master’s degree.Initially, I was welcomed on and had a really great time getting to know people and contribute, and my performance review was “exceeds all expectations” from everyone on my team. My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.Fast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. EX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”First, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.I’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. I do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone. My goal here is to simply prevent this type of rhetoric from hurting my career and reputation.I’m seeking advice on how to handle this situation. Just let it go and roll with the punches, defend myself in the moment, discuss this with someone higher up, etc…",

Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.Should I keep looking for a job?

I'd appreciate if some senior engineers could give their insight into working on an infra team in terms of career growth (junior -> senior).A lot of people on my team are pretty experienced with only a couple junior engineers which is pretty common for infra teams. I've read that infra teams tend to give more scope than product teams for senior engineers who are looking to be promoted to staff. However, how is career progression from junior to senior? Will it be slow due to there being many tenured folks? Talking to some of the folks, they said that the team is harder than other teams to onboard onto because of the technical complexity. I feel like working on an infra team as a new grad is a rare opportunity but I am also hesitant on career progression even though a new grad on the team did make it to senior in 5 years.Any input would be appreciated :)Edit: I work on cloud infrastructure. Kotlin for API development and Ruby for scripts.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I would like to start this post by saying I'm incredibly grateful to be employed. I graduated in May 2025 with a Computer Science degree and 2 internships at smaller companies. I should've gone harder in college and gotten internships at bigger and better companies as I'm floundering currently with other applications. I got hired off return offer from my junior year Machine Learning internship as a Python developer at the same pharmacy. However - 4 weeks into my job and I have not written a single line of code and it's all IT stuff. It is genuinely crushing as I've been applying to other roles and not hearing back shit (while my younger brother is getting quant role interviews lmfao).I have no idea what to do. I would ideally like to pivot to a SWE role in Fintech/Defense, and I've been making projects/doing leetcode in my free time to help me apply but I genuinely feel like the no name companies I've worked for in my past have made me a unserious candidate. Haven't gotten a single interview since May. Has anybody ever been in a similar situation?PS I also never network. This is definitely ruining my odds as I think cold applying is dead for somebody with my shitty experience but it feels like begging",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It's become an issue that I feel I need to address in some way because I notice a senior dev does this with me more than most. The story will be refined and discussed and then the sprint will start. After I'm near the finish line and the PR is put out, he will suddenly remember changes that we should add to the feature I'm working on. Then he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away \"it should be quick\". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work. I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work. The changes he talks about make sense, I just think they can be added in a productive stable manner.",

        "content": "I’m a senior software engineer with 4.5 years of experience (recently promoted) and have contributed a lot in my team. I constantly doubt my own understanding and technical skills, which has led to a sense of imposter syndrome. Even with several years of experience, I find myself questioning whether I truly grasp certain topics or if I’m just missing something everyone else understands. I am truly worried if somebody will ask me something during the meetings because of this. I often feel that when I discuss technical topics, the person I’m talking to tends to speak vaguely or there’s some misunderstanding at first. I also wonder if part of the issue is that my thoughts don’t always come across exactly as I intend in English, or maybe I have difficulty understanding vague explanations. Is this something others experience? How do you handle or improve communication in technical discussions to avoid misunderstandings?I also notice that other senior engineers seem skilled, they can answer almost any question on the spot whereas I’m not that type of person. When I’m asked something technical, I usually need some quiet time to fully understand the question, then I look through the relevant files and documentation before I can come up with a good answer. Sometimes I worry this means I’m not as competent, maybe I shouldn’t even be senior engineer in the first place.",

        "content": "Background (skip further down if you don't care):I'm a SENG with 3+ years working on a product that was acquired by Trimble in 2023. Nobody knew we were getting acquired besides our CEO at the time. When they told us our new salaries I'm not sure what they were based on since the lead (who actually knows what I do) wasn't involved at all. I wasn't exactly happy with my new salary compared to my coworkers so I spoke with my manager (formerly the lead) and told him I'll take on more work/responsibility so I can get a promotion down the line. So I bust my ass for 1.5 years and finally he tells me he's submitting a request that I'm promoted with the higher ups. Fast forward *8 months*, nothing. Two performance reviews during this time and my manager doesn't really know what's going on, no updates from anyone. So I'm frustrated, burnt out, unmotivated, and feel taken advantage of.My question (skip here):In my search for a new job I have an opportunity at Stripe. Stripe pays twice what I'm paid at Trimble but the internet tells me the wlb and culture there sucks, like Amazon bad. Now I'm fine with occasionally working late but it can't be every day and I can put up with annoying coworkers if I can just focus on my work and don't deal with them much. In contrast I love my coworkers where I currently am, we're all buddies. The culture at our office is amazing, but the work itself isn't always great as I'm constantly helping other teams. So is the pay at Stripe really worth it? Do I just take the leap and see how it goes? I don't want to be miserable at my job but I also want to get paid what I know I'm worth.",
