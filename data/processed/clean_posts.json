No reproducible environment. Half the dependencies aren't even pinned to versions.Last week someone tried to push a model to production that only worked on their specific laptop because they'd manually installed some library months ago and forgot about it. Took us four days to figure out what was even needed to run the thing.I get that they're not infrastructure people. But at what point does this become their problem too? Or is this just what working with ml teams is always going to be like?",

Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.Even if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.In my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.I actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.Is this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?",

There’s also a path here for data analysts to move into data science, which pays better and involves predictive analytics and advanced modeling.That used to be my plan, but lately I’ve realized I’m not sure it’s for me. I’m autistic and I struggle with the constant presentations, storytelling, and meetings that come with more “business-facing” roles. I’m very introverted and prefer structured, predictable work and I’ve noticed the parts I enjoy most are the engineering ones: building pipelines, automating processes, making data flow efficiently.I don’t have a software engineering background (I’m a physicist), but I’ve always done well with computational work and Python. I haven’t worked with Spark, IaC, or devops yet, but I like that kind of technical challenge.I’m not looking for advice per se, just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone here has had a similar experience, moving from a data or analytics-heavy background into something more engineering-focused.",

The previous Data Engineering Manager became a specialist and left the company. It's a bad position, infrastructure has always been an afterthought for everybody here and upper management has the absolute conviction that I don't need to be technical to manage the team. It's been +/- 5 months and, obviously, I am convinced that's just BS. The market in my country is hard right now, so looking for something in my field might be a little difficult. I decided to accept this as a challenge and try to be optimistic. So I'm looking for advice and resources I can consult and maybe even become a full on Data Engineer myself. This company is a Google Partner, so we mostly use GCP. Most used services include BigQuery, Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Cloud Composer, DataForm and Lookerstudio for dashboards.I'm already looking into the Skills Boost data engineer path, but I'm thinking it's all over the place and so generalist.Any help?",

I’ve done an AI-focused internship for a year, and I consider myself intermediate in Python, SQL, and ML.I’m stuck deciding between two paths -- AI/ML sounds exciting but honestly, It feels like I’d constantly have to innovate and keep up with new research, and Idk if I can keep that pace long term.- Data engineering seems more stable and routine because it’s mainly building and maintaining pipelines. I like that it feels more structured day-to-day, but I’d basically be starting from scratch learning it.With just 16 months left and visa rules changing, I’m nervous about making the wrong choice.If you’ve worked in either field, what’s your honest take on this?Based on my profile, i might struggle to land an entry-level ML job cos I only have one year of internship experience. I’d really appreciate your recommendations. I get that ML jobs are limited, so any guidance to navigate this would mean a lot.I’m confident I can put in the work necessary but the thought of my AI/ML internship experience going to waste if I switch to data engineering is scary. I’m not afraid to start fresh, but I want to be smart about it",

The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. Our pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. Everything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. Is this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place? My job is such that I feel even after hours or on weekends im thinking of all the things I have to do. When I log into work these days I feel so groggy.",

Essentially, I will have the following entity:* student* class* teacher* paymentAnd while designing this new database, aside from migration, I'm currently planning ahead on implementing design choices that will help me with my work, some of them are currently this:* track payments (installment/renewal, if installment, how much left, etc)* attendance (to track whether or not the student skipped the class, more on that below)Basically, my company's course model is session based, so students paid some amount of sessions, and they will attend the class based on this sessions balance, so to speak. I came up with a two ideas for this attendance tracking:* since they are on fixed schedule, only lists out when they took a leave (so it wouldn't be counted on the number of sessions they used)* make an explicit attendance entity.I get quite overwhelmed with the rabbit hole of trying to make the db perfect from the start. Is it easy to just change my schema on the run? Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better? How should I know is my design is already fine?Thanks for the help!",

        "author": "ThqXbs8",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# SamaraI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.The idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.## What My Project DoesYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)- Where the results should go- What to do when things succeed or failSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.## Target Audience**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.## Current State- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)- Full type safety throughout- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress## Looking for ContributorsThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:- Extend Polars engine support- Build out transformation library- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and DatabasesCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)Star it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.---Example: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:```yamlworkflow: id: product-cleanup-pipeline description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data enabled: true jobs: - id: clean-products description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data enabled: true engine_type: spark # Extract product data from CSV file extracts: - id: extract-products extract_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/ method: batch options: delimiter: \",\" header: true inferSchema: false schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns transforms: - id: transform-clean-products upstream_id: extract-products options: {} functions: # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns - function_type: dropDuplicates arguments: columns: [] # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types - function_type: cast arguments: columns: - column_name: price cast_type: double - column_name: stock_quantity cast_type: integer - column_name: is_available cast_type: boolean - column_name: last_updated cast_type: date # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output - function_type: select arguments: columns: - product_id - product_name - category - price - stock_quantity - is_available # Load the cleaned data to output loads: - id: load-clean-products upstream_id: transform-clean-products load_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output method: batch mode: overwrite options: header: true schema_export: \"\" # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle hooks: onStart: [] onFailure: [] onSuccess: [] onFinally: []```",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m currently doing a Data Engineering internship (been around 3 months), and I’m honestly starting to question whether it’s worth continuing anymore.When I joined, I was super excited to learn real-world stuff — build data pipelines, understand architecture, and get proper mentorship from seniors. But the reality has been quite different.Most of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.For example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.Same with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.I totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.Now I’m wondering:Should I stay another month and try to make the best of it,or resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?Would leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?Has anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?I’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.EditAfter going through everyone’s advice here, I’ve decided not to quit the internship for now. Instead, I’ll focus more on self-learning and building consistency until I find a better opportunity.Honestly, this experience has been a rollercoaster — frustrating at times, but it’s also pushing me to think like a real data engineer. I’ve started enjoying those moments when, after hours of debugging and trial-and-error, I finally fix an issue without any senior’s help. That satisfaction is on another levelThanks",

The way that i see is that this company's workload is ridiculously demanding.20 story points per sprints to begin with. And some of the tickets are just too many subtasks for 3 story points. For example setup an etl pipeline complete with cicd deployment for all envs will just cost you a 3 story point.. Besides usually the tickets just have the title, no description whatsoever. Assignee is responsible to find out information about the tickets. And i also got comments on things like i will need to have more accountability on the projects, I mean its just been 6 months.And there are 2 other seniors, both of them are workaholic and they basically set the bar here. they spent time working exactly 12 hours average on daily basis. Additionally, why im saying my team is weird is because i have been doing research and been talking to otber teams. Lets just say only my team have ridiculous story pointings. They shout worklife balance and no need to work extra hours, but how can one finish their task without extras hours if workloads are just too much. Honestly, although i can push myself to be like them, i choose not to. Im already senior level and looking for a place to settle and work as long as i could.Question, will things get better? Should I stay or leave? Manager said stuffs like will support during remaining probation but so far, everything that I suggested just thrown back at me.",

It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.The positives of the role are as follows:- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.The negatives are as follows:- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.Due to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.I am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.What should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.What thoughts/advice do people have?

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.For example, in my setup:PostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial dataMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)DuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasetsFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.However, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.So my question is:**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**Is it mostly about:Maintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data.

I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. 1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). 2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!Thank you!",

All on the starter subscription.Then, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.We are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!Ok, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.We already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.And to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.Is segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification? Is the only viable option self-hosting OSS or creating something yourself at this point?And what are you guys using?

As titled, am I Missing Hidden Costs/Tradeoffs?We're a small shop, 5 data people, <10TB of production data.We used to run our analytics in the production's read replica, but nowadays it always timed out / failed bcz of transaction conflicts.We're storing a snapshot of historical data every day for audit/regulatory purposes (as pg dump and restoring it when we need to do an audit.We're moving our data to a dedicated place. We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.But we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  For the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.With either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshiftWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term. \\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance \\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.I'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it. On Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a queryQuestion:1. Does this storage model make sense?2. Are there hidden compute costs? (from vacuuming/optimization)",

Now, there is a huge question mark on whether this technology will even become viable within the next decade for industry application beyond research labs-- but regardless, it's fun to do these thought exercises. Two areas where I see key assumptions changing for data engineering are...1. Security Compliance and Governance2. Managing StateThe security component is actually already top of mind for governments and major enterprises who are concerned with \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks ([NIST.gov Report](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/what-post-quantum-cryptography), [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-quantum/)). Essentially the core assumption is that encryption is \"obsolete\" if quantum becomes viable at scale so various actors are scooping up encrypted data today hoping the secrets will be useful in a future state. The managing state component is interesting to me as an entity can either be 0, 1, or simultaneously both (i.e. superposition) until measured. This is what opens up strong computing capabilities, but how would you model data with these properties? Is anyone else thinking about this stuff?",

        "content": "How do you handle schema changes on a cdc tracked table? I tested some scenarios with CDC enabled and I’m a bit confused what is going to work or not. To give you an overview, I want to enable CDC on my tables and consume all the data from a third party(Microsoft Fabric). Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. I’ll give you an example to follow.I have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. Now some changes may appear in this operational table1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example). Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. 4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing Did you encounter similar issues in your development? How did you tackle it?Also, if you have any advices that you want to share related to your experience with CDC, it will be more than welcomed.

This works really well for our team, and give us very fined grain control over our database objects.I’m trying to figure out the right separation of responsibilities between dbt and an external DDL tool:- Is it recommended or safe to let something like SnowDDL/Atlas manage Snowflake objects, and only use dbt as the transformation tool to update and insert records?- How do you prevent dbt from dropping or replacing tables it didn’t create (so you don’t lose grants, sequences, metadata, etc…)?Would love to hear how other teams draw the line between:- DDL / schema versioning (SnowDDL, Atlas, Terraform, etc.)- Transformation logic / data lineage (dbt)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.My Goal:I want a containerized setup where:1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.My Current Architecture & Problem:I have the following containers working mostly independently:· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.· grafana: Connected to Trino.The missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).This is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.What I've Tried/Researched:· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.My Specific Question:Is the \"Hive Metastore in a container\" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?Any advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.For context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.I use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.Currently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.There is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.My idea: Step 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.Step 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the \"reporting\" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization onlyMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.My points to go for step 2:- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased Anything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. Right now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.I guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be?

        "author": "Salt_Anteater3307",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,I am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. There is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.Here’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.The process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:I would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.I would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.I tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.In theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.So here what I am wondering:Has anyone built something similar?Does this approach scale?Are there proven practice for this that I might be missing?So yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",

        "content": "We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. Turns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. I searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. Now, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance \\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector \\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy \\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them \\- Directions for even further optimizations and learningHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search!

        "content": "Hey everyone,I wanted to get some community perspective on something I’ve been exploring lately.I’m currently pursuing my master’s in Information Systems, with a focus on data-related fields — things like data engineering, data visualization, data mining, processing and AI, ML as well. Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.I thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.However, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:It’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.Smaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.Larger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.Their suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.That makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.Has anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?How did you position yourself for it?Are there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?And lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?Would love to hear your experiences or advice.Thanks in advance!",

And we've received some new requirements which our system doesn't support, such as time travel.So we need a system that can better manage schema, support time travel.I've looked at Apache Iceberg with Spark Dataframes, which comes really close to a perfect solution, but it seems to only work around the newest schema, unless querying snapshots which don't bring new data. We may have new data that follows an older schema come in, and we'd want to be able to query new data with an old schema.I've seen suggestions that Iceberg supports those cases, as it handles the schema with metadata, but I couldn't find a concrete implementation of the solution. I can provide some code snippets for what I've tried, if it helps.So does Iceberg already support this case, and I'm just missing something? If not, is there an already available solution to this kind of problem?**EDIT:** Forgot to mention that data matching older schemas may still be coming in after the schema evolved",

However, I guess my question is like, is there any maths or anything that happens to the inputs of (for example) RGB(120, 120, 120) that allows the computer to know its some kind of greyish hue, and if there is, what is that? Okay so maybe some clarification is needed: I know the computer doesn't \\_know\\_ (in the sense humans know things) that grey is grey and not chartreuse. I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",

I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.I'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here.

Something interesting came up: a small website with almost no traffic can be recommended more often than a highly optimized SEO site, if the content structure is cleaner and easier to interpret.It made me realize the model isn’t “ranking” pages the way Google does. It’s more like it selects pages it can reliably extract meaning from.I’m trying to understand the programming side of this better.My question:What is the best way to think about how LLMs evaluate page structure when pulling information?Is this closer to embedding similarity, structured parsing, some hybrid retrieval layer, or something else entirely?",

My main responsibilities include providing nationwide ERP support, conducting user training, and identifying system bugs. Currently, I am involved in verifying software prototypes, analyzing system designs, and reviewing BRD and SRS documents for upcoming new software. I also have a good understanding of how various business modules work, such as Accounts, Inventory, LC, Sales, and others.However, I don’t see good career growth or salary progression in ERP administrative roles. I’m also not as satisfied with my job as I used to be. Before this role, I had strong programming knowledge and worked as a Junior Programmer. I used to work with PHP, Laravel, vanilla JavaScript, API integration, jQuery, and more. I also have a solid understanding of SQL databases.Now, at the age of 34, I want to return to programming. Since I already have a background in development, what strategy should I follow to become a good software engineer and secure a remote job or earn through freelancing?In this AI-driven world, how can I adapt my programming skills effectively? Could you please provide me with a clear roadmap to get back into programming and build a successful career as a software engineer with a good salary?",

For production itself, I made all the commits through GitHub Desktop and later hosted the project on Cloudflare.Now, I am asking seniors whether I’m doing something wrong or if I should start learning Git commands and switch to the CLI.

Or have you found a more integrated way to learn?",

Apparently, it's an SQLite feature and I don't know if this is going to be a problem when I use other management systems.I'm afraid Type Affinities would make it harder for me to switch to another system later, because I checked and apparently all the other major systems (Microsoft, Postgress, MySQL) have stricter data types.I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it? Maybe Type affinities aren't really that important and I could just ignore it? Or should I switch now to a more standard course that uses another database system like MySql?Advice?My goal is to either get a backend job or a data analyst job. I know to build a promising career I need to be adaptable, but I'm still learning and I don't want to pick up odd habits because I've always had trouble shaking them off.Thank You.",

Maybe four years is too short, especially because one year was online because of COVID.I learned C++, Django, React, and React Native. I can learn new languages and frameworks quickly. Still, I think I could be better if I worked harder on problem solving and development.Now, I am confused. I don’t know what to focus on to get my dream. Sometimes I think I should do more competitive programming to get better at data structures and algorithms. Other times, I think learning MERN stack or backend frameworks like .NET or Spring Boot is better. I also wonder if learning languages like C# or Java is useful.There is so much information and many choices. I spent many hours thinking but I am still stuck.",

But outside of seeing how other people do it I struggle to know where to abstract or to just make fluid or modular as opposed to rigid and repeating the same logic over and over. The balance of over-complicating versus just getting it running. And know whether suggestions or examples actually are even relevant or a good way of creating the flow I intend in the first place. I guess this is more of a general question but yeah how do you focus on learning that? Like I understand concepts and often when I am moving through something I go to the underlying functionality of a method or existing class to explore options but I keep feeling like, I know I am neither the smartest or most experienced, so how can I find models of good ways of doing things or at least the principals to have some checklist or reference point to judge myself against?",

But I feel inadequate...Although I know how to code, I feel like my lack of experience is killing me. I have \"created\" several projects on my own in my own time. A video game in GameMaker Studio, a JavaScript/HTML based NFL Trivia Website, and a Python based NFL Prediction program that uses Pandas to collect data... Although I \"created\" those projects, I gotta admit... They weren't created off the top of the ol' dome. The best way I can explain them is that they were put together with duct tape and bubble gum haha. Whenever I need help with a specific portion, i'd just google the question I had, use code from different forums and tutorials, and edit that code it to fit my specific needs. Like I have no idea how to just free-hand use Pandas for my NFL Algorithm. There is countless hours of googling and taking code to be able to make it happen. I don't know how to just free-hand create an HTML site lol. I just used the code that we learned in a project in school and edited to fit my ideas...I feel like an idiot for that. I guess the best solution is to just keep practicing... but for right now, I just feel like a fraud for not knowing all the intricacies of the languages I use. I am actively looking for entry-level jobs, especially because I have experience in the industy as an Engineering Technician that exposed me to the code that software engineers wrote... But I feel like my first interview (assuming I get that far) is going to be a disaster and i'll get made out to be a fraud...Has anyone else felt this level of Imposter Syndrome?",

        "content": "So for the past 2 years, I have been scripting/reading scripts and learning the basics of programming languages. In school, I learned basic R for Data Science courses, basic SQL for Data Management & Analysis, and basic Python for some general purpose programming. I really enjoyed my work in those classes, though at times I felt exhausted and stupid.Now I work as an Insurance Aide and most of my week consists of scripting/documentation somehow. I am now responsible for building an MS Access Reporting tool and using Excel, SQL, and VBA, and documenting our existing codebase for our \"applications\".While I enjoy my work, I recognize that working with VBA isn't what programming looks like in the typical sense of the word. I don't record macros, but there's a lot of abstraction in VBA and I feel like it's quite different from in depth programming work people do in python and other languages. I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues. I feel like I might like \"scripting\" instead of \"programming\", but I'm not even sure how to define the difference between the two, apart from how programming involves more technical memory allocation while \"scripting\" is the surface level \"do this do that\" of programming. TL;DR: Do I like programming or scripting? And if I like scripting, what does that mean for my self-education journey (I'm currently re-introducing myself to Python)?",

Progrmming (Python)2. Signal processing3. Dsp simulation4. acoustic engineering5. psychoacoustics6. Spatial Audio / HRTF7. Coordinates → Audio MappingI studied Python through YouTube lectures, but I didn't fully understand it.I’m currently studying “Think Dsp” and I’m understanding it one by one by following the examples and adding my own comments.I’m trying to somehow get used to Python and the computer language system.I thought, Instead of following an example, why not just write the code from scratch?But I'm afraid it'll take too much time.Impatience comes first.**This is the one thing I really want to know.**How much of the basics should I study before starting a project?Is it better to start a project right away, even if I know nothing?I'm not sure if I'm on the right track right now, so I'm honestly asking for help.I took a year off from university to study on my own.But I had no one to talk to about these thingsEventually, I was trapped in my own world, talking to AI every day.Then I discovered Reddit,and I was genuinely moved seeing how people here give honest, caring advice to complete strangers.That’s what gave me the courage to write this post.And someday, I hope to be someone who can give advice to people who are lost like me.I’m still inexperienced, but I believe your words can change the direction of my life.Thank you, truly, for reading all of this.",

While studying, I worked in restaurants, sales, and random jobs to pay the bills, so I never actually got hands-on IT experience. After graduating, I found a better-paying job at an outsourcing/customer support company — still not IT.Now I feel stuck. The job drains me, and I don’t see a future in it. I want to switch back to IT and start building real skills, but I feel like I forgot everything I studied. When I look into tech careers, there are so many paths and sub-fields that I don’t even know where to start or how long it would take to become employable.For anyone who’s been in this situation — how did you pick a starting point? Is it too late to switch? What would you do if you were in my place?Any advice or direction would help a lot. **Note:** After doing some research, I’m planning to start with the *Google IT Support Professional Certificate*, then move on to the *CompTIA A+*.

        "content": "Context: As part of my self-study routine, alongside reading \\*The Algorithm Design Manual\\* by Skiena, I practice LeetCode problems. I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).I’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.When I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\\* Backtracking\\* Dynamic Programming\\* MemoizationI can also identify the problem category:\\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)I’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best. I’d like to hear about your experiences and any advice that helped you overcome similar difficulties. Thanks!",

        "content": "Hello. I'm a Junior Dev working mainly with Python.I've been asked to write a series of unit tests for a feature that I'm implementing on a project that I've worked on for a couple of months already.To give some context. It's a microservice using a company-developed ORM. Each microservice inherit from a base class with a series of functionalities and the ORM itself. These microservices communicate with each other through a message broker.I need to write tests mainly for business logic and the ORM-related service layer queries. I’ve never written tests before, so I’ve been reading documentation and watching tutorials but most of the material I find is too basic and not fit for what I need.I've managed to write most of the tests for the business logic part, but I find it quite hard to do so for the ORM queries.The main issue I'm facing is understanding how to effectively test ORM queries. Most examples I see online suggest using mocks with predefined return values, but I don’t really see the value in that. If I mock everything, I’m basically faking entire functionalities. So if after adding a new feature or refactoring code were to break, these tests would not detect it. So what am I testing?I feel like I'm testing the same things that I'm writing which doesn't make sense to me.I'd really appreciate some help on this. Thanks in advance! :)",

But workflow when it comes to keyboard navigation and shortcuts is awful, because I don't know what I don't know. So my workflow is significantly hindered because I spend so much time just trying to get where I need to go, and not just in text, but in the editor (vscode currently).Any help is appreciated :)(also what are vim motions?

It adds up to **1,403 cuts statewide** — it’s unclear how the overall cuts might be affecting subsidiaries. (Amazon also owns Audible, Twitch, Goodreads, Whole Foods, Zoox and Ring.)Who are these laid-off workers? **Software development engineers make up the largest category, with hundreds of cuts listed across the documents**. Amazon is also shedding recruiters, business analysts, marketers and managers. The layoffs in Irvine and San Diego, where Amazon has video game studios, include dozens of game designers and game artists.This sheds some light on how affected SWEs were by this layoff in California at least. Not sure about other locations. The total layoff number is 14000",

I get that it's a big company with AWS, storefront, delivery, video, etc. But I cannot imagine tens of thousands of engineers being used effectively.A lot of these people seem to work on very unused or obscure services and features.

You have 2 developers in your team, 1 of them is autistic, the other one is naturally gifted and hates retards ( yes the interviewer actually said this word ), the autistic developer has to present his work and the other developer is intentionally asking difficult questions to flex his intellectual.How would you handle this??????

This was for a very popular payment company.Instead of asking me whether to use cursor-based or off-set pagination or how to implement it all, they asked me \"**why is it called pagination and where did this term originate from?**\"I couldn't answer and they just told me \"**okay, it seems like you're struggling hard, let's just move on to pair programming.

Delivering uber eats destroyed my car in this time that i literally just cashed out my old 401k, the absolute last of my savings.

        "content": "After about 5+ years in this field, I've realized that it's always better to prefer polish over speed.The reason is simple. Unless you work in an extremely isolated silo, you are not entirely responsible for your speed.When people review your code you don't get bonus points for how quickly you wrote it.However, if there are issues with your code, for that you are entirely responsible.If there's some edge case that you didn't properly check, you're responsible for that. If you missed some step in preparing your PR, you're responsible for that. If your code is difficult for others to read, you're responsible for that.Managers will always want you to be fast but speed is a shared responsibility.You cannot be fast if the code base you inherited is a mess. You cannot be fast if the company keeps changing direction. You cannot be fast if your work is rate limited by other people or systems.I've found this applies across orgs of all levels.In big orgs you'll be slowed down by more processes and structure.In small orgs the lack of process and structure increases the potential for mistakes and misunderstandings.Without really knowing the ins and outs of what someone is working on, it's hard to say if they're actually slow but a mistake is a mistake. Now and forever. When it comes time for performance reviews, no one will have the context to know if the time you spent was reasonable but if someone is looking to get rid of you, they will form a collage of every single wrong-doing you committed since the day you joined.So remember, slow down and try to consistently get everything right on the first try.",

If I think that I'm correct I'm willing to accept other ideas if they also work, and also that I prefer solutions that work best with the team over solutions that would technically be better but for example being too complicated to explain.Then I said that it also depends on the situation, and told a story about a pointless discussion at the end of a meeting. There were ten developers in the room and two developers started discussing variable naming and I said that I'm okay with both styles as long as we have a clear guideline.The discussion went on and on and I politely left the meeting as I couldn't contribute anything and wanted to get back to work to finish my tickets. I told this story because I wanted to show that I'm efficient and don't want to waste time on discussions that could have been a simple email.I assumed this efficiency would be appreciated, especially as it would have been an expensive external position where every hour counts. But they never heard of someone leaving a meeting early and thought it showed that I'm arrogant and don't care about the team.I never expected such a reaction, as I regularly did that in previous projects.

I started learning to code with Java back in 2017, so I learned to code \"the old-fashioned way\" by looking at documentation and/or stack overflow before AI came into the mainstream.I now work in test automation primarily using C#, but I also have quite a bit of experience with Python as well. I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like \"My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now.\" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.When you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you? In my experience it seems to be good at things like leetcode, but bad in large codebases with dependencies and structure.Edit: From these responses it seems like most of you use AI basically the same way I do, with the exception of the cursor comments. Unfortunately I’m in a corporation so switching to cursor and trying it out isn’t really feasible for me in this context. Maybe I’ll give it a try on my own and see how it does for a side project.",

There is no future if the company ever IPOs because the strike price would probably be higher than the stock value. The current company I work for gave me RSUs but I'm completely lowballed. The RSUs are worth $20k over 4 years based on the FMV. A friend who worked at Uber mentioned that Uber IPO'd at $45 but after the 6 month lockup, the stock was around $27 but they had the pay taxes on the IPO price. Similar story with Lyft IPO and 6 month lockup. So some employees received significantly lower RSU packages they were expecting and even lost some money.

It might sound easy due to not coding, but i need to stretch my brain in a way that just gets me very overwhelmed, while also being incredibly BORED.I just never imagined that, I would be coding less, while being 5x more stressed than ever. A lot of the requirement documents I review are poorly written, so I have to keep scheduling meetings / following up with ppl to ask questions.. my day sometimes is just meetings ALL day, with almost no time to eat a damn meal. And then I need time to do code review so my team members' aren't blocked! So oftentimes, I do the code review at like 7pm after dinner or early in the morning the next day. Shit's fucked.

        "author": "Dovageris",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm an ML Engineer with 6 YoE and a PhD for ML in Applied Math, based in the US. I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to \"unlimited\" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.For the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.Just for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of \"R&D\" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.But whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had \"unlimited\" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.Everyone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.Any advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad. Beyond that, if anyone has experience with this I'd like to hear about it so I can understand what to do / not to do.",

But I can’t stomach pseudo unemployment anymore.The new place develops agentic solutions for some really big government clients. Cool so far.

And it’s especially subject to client expectations, which…. I mean— i feel like a country bum for making this observation— are ludicrous and verging on offensive. 3 weeks to develop a fully functional system? It seems insane. I’m trying to deliver fast, but the only way to iterate fast is to vibe code and frankly it’s a mind numbing exercise. I’m assessing the potential damage on my learning trajectory and well… i dunno. I feel like I’m just reinforcing my fraud status. I know that this is a stupid gripe to have especially when i’m lucky to even have a job. And I don’t have any other worthwhile experiences to benchmark against since the research lab was an atrocious place on all facets (garbage PI, no contract, no benefits, slow progress) except for the publication potential and the exposure to academic connections and really really intelligent people (who also happen to be horrible human beings).",

I was already on the verge of burning out because I was on track for promo but \"because of org changes we don't know when exactly it'll happen\"So I've started applying for internal positions well before this event but now with this news I got a decent severance package and due to my accrued PTO+ Years spent in this firm, i think overall I'll get almost 6months of pay. Now, i also have an option to pursue an internal position in an adjacent team which is basically a 1:1 mapping of my current role and I know that team works a lot and the work over there is mehh or at least not that interests me long term but also likely not be able to prep for interviews due to the expectations. I can basically pull some strings and have high confidence i can get that offer, but if they offer and regardless of whether i accept or reject i'll loose this severance package. It's clear to me that 6month pay is much better than this internal position but i'm on H1b and have until March 2026 to find a job. if not I'm screwed or i'll have to think about changing to B1/B2 to buy time or joining a consulting firm which i want to avoid. With this job market and all this VISA bs i'm not really sure if i can find a new job within March, but the thought of 6month severance without doing any work seems really sweet to recover mentally and get on the leetcode grind. What do you think is the better play? should i just pull my internal applications and get out with severance and try my luck outside? (Somewhat confident i'll find something in 6 months). Or take that internal position and be safe, loose that sweet severance work for some time and switch with position of power? I personally want to take severance but with this VISA limbo i'm super confused about what's better. Really appreciate all your help/advice here.",

Now, 3 months into my new job, I've just learned our team is being offshored and I'll be out of a job at the end of the month. And unfortunately for me there is no longer a great abundance of integration consultant jobs like there was a couple of months ago, and most team lead roles want some amount of development experience.

While filling out the job application3. During a virtual one-way interview4. To the recruiter while scheduling this interviewI understand that the job listing specified they're looking for continuing students, but I provided my graduation date several times prior to this interview and they didn't seem to have an issue. I've also interviewed for other internships targeting continuing students and no company has had an issue with my graduation date yet. Is it worth sending a follow up email to see if they're willing to budge? This experience has definitely soured me on working at this company, but it's a well-compensated remote role that I'm very qualified for. And in this job market, I'm hesitant to give up any opportunity so quickly.",

At this point I'm not really sure what to do.I've been debating on returning to school to pursue a second degree in data science, as it seems to be the most relevant field of business pertaining to comp sci. There's a solid chance of me getting into the school I want, and there are a couple of scholarships I could apply for to help me out tuition-wise, plus I'd already have some credits done (mostly gen-ed) from my previous degree. **I guess I'm writing to ask what others in this same position are doing or thinking with the current state of the C.S. economy in the US.** It feels like a degree in C.S. just leads you to a dead-end road, and I don't know if it's worth sticking to at this point.",

That is, join when the company is laying off people as the “price” is less (less competition because of people who are scared of joining because they’ve heard of the layoff news)The whole premise of this question depends on the idea that people are more hesitant to apply to and join a company that has recently laid off.

The company is great, people are nice, pay for my area is pretty good, etc. I was offered to continue my internship part time through the school year and have continued working there ever since. Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. Side note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles.",

It honestly feels like a hackathon.I’m trying to understand the system logic and learn SnapLogic at the same time. I’m making progress, but I’m frustrated. Yesterday I found a bug and figured out the root cause and fix in minutes — but then spent the entire day figuring out how to implement it in SnapLogic. Tried docs, AI tools, trial-and-error… nothing. Finally got help from a SnapLogic dev in another team and he solved it in 15 minutes.On top of that, this feels like a career-direction issue too. My manager is changing soon, which means I’ll likely be stuck owning this SnapLogic project long-term. Once it goes to production it’ll mostly just be maintenance and I don’t want to get pigeonholed into this. I want to stay focused on backend Java projects, not get boxed into ETL work I’m not excited about.How do you handle situations where you get assigned to a project you’re really not interested in and don’t want to end up tied to long-term?

        "content": "I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.&nbsp;For context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.&nbsp;To be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).&nbsp;> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.&nbsp;> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.&nbsp;>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.&nbsp;There were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.&nbsp;I did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.&nbsp;It just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

This team uses .NET + Postgres + Azure. I’ve used Postgres for simple personal projects, but no complex schemas or data types. The feedback I got from the recruiter before this next stage was that they thought I was an excellent culture fit with appropriate knowledge of .NET, but they mentioned I might not have the depth of knowledge with Azure and Postgres. The recruiter said it’d be best to brush up on these and that “_They will likely ask about your skill sets in those areas and how you would deal with common problems that are encountered in Azure and Postgres_”. I get it, they don’t want an engineer that might struggle adapting to their environment. I am not worried I’d have trouble picking these up, I’m just worried about this next stage of discussion. My issue is that there is *so* much to study in just a couple of days. *What are some common problems in your experience? Coming from AWS and MSSQL what speed bumps would I expect to encounter in this interview?*I’ve picked out a couple of topics I think might come up, but the subject is so broad and I’m really not sure what type of questions I’ll encounter.**Postgres*** MVCC* Complex and composite data types* JSONB* Object relations**Azure*** Relating AWS services I’ve used to comparable Azure services* Pricing models maybe?* ?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m about six months into my first full-time software engineering job at Apple, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.I also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.For example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.I also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.Lately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.What really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.Has anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind? Is this normal? Are there courses, books, or resources that helped you connect the dots and understand the bigger picture of how software systems work in practice?Any advice would mean a lot.",

Really want to work as an engineer for hedge fund or something to do with trading and quantitative stuff. My company will pay for my masters but that means staying there another 3-4 years.

I find myself as somebody who wants to get better everyday but this new stage in life seems like I reached a pinnacle. Anybody ever feel the same way? I see people here grinding for jobs and complaining they can’t get one so maybe I’m just ungrateful. TL;DR feeling like I’m not doing enough despite having a decent job.

So far it doesn’t seem too hard, but I’ve heard that goroutines and Gin get tricky later on.So, my question is: Should I focus on Python (faster prototyping, slower execution), or Go (backend-focused, is fast and unique, but harder to master as a developer language)? Would love to hear some insights!!(if I'm breaking feel free to take this down)",

I make mistakes, small stupid mistakes at work. Mistakes only junior engineers should be making. I’ve made one last week. I feel like whenever I get feedback on these mistakes, it feels like it sets me back a whole year. To be promoted at my company I need to not make a single mistake and keep a perfect track record, receive no bad feedback, and deliver something impactful. Maybe it’s just me but I feel like as soon as I receive feedback from a peer that’s somewhat negative, it means that I’ll have to wait again till next year to try again for a promotion. Does anyone feel this way as well? I’m stuck in a mid level role and I’m not sure if I’m even capable of being a senior engineer because of this.",

So, I don't really care if a HM or whatever doesn't like what they see. That being said, would it be bad in this day and age to just have a repo with many large, quick commits that indicate the obvious use of an AI tool? One the one hand, \"he's vibe-coding and can't do this without AI\", on the other hand, it shows I can use modern tools to quickly deliver something.",

Some worked for \"famous\" companies, even got some with titles shouldn't apply to our job.My team has been trying to hire people since a few months ago. We first were looking for candidates who know the tech stack. We got bunch of resumes from the consulting companies that mentioned they have worked on the tech stack, and they all have at least 7+ years of experience ( in general), but literally none of them passed our two round interview. The first one is questions about some basic knowledge ( basic if you've worked on the tech stack, in my opinion ), and questions about how the candidates would solve a problem.The second round is a coding challenge while sharing the screen (like pair programming where we might give some hints) that only takes about 90 mins. The features we asked them to do are really basic if they have worked on the tech stack before, and we also allowed them to google and check the documentation if they want, it really is an open book exam, but just no AI stuff. 90 mins is really more than enough to complete.None of them passed. We decided to look for candidates who know a different tech stack that I think is more well known compared to the first one, but also to focus on how they solve problems, like the approach they take, how they are solving it, and etc. Guess what, literally only 2 of them passed and they aren't really the devs we are looking for, we only hired them because we realized they know a tech stack well enough and seems to be alright when it comes to learning new things.We have interviewed more than 40 people already.

I’m having difficulty finding any students of the program and a quick search on LinkedIn found very little software engineers from that university.However, I chose it because it was the lease restrictive on its leveling course requirement, which would save me a year or two compared to other programs where it would take around five years including leveling courses vs versus 2 to 3 years at Concordia. I am getting tuition paid so that is not a concern.I have done Web Dev on my own time and made a To-Do program using react and all the basic building blocks before that in terms of technical skills, about 1 year of self learning experience. I have no education in computer science, and so I thought this message would at least show employers that I am worth hiring. Would it be a bad idea to do this masters program? I was thinking that while I’m doing the program that could provide some leverage in addition with my projects to get hired at an entry level role. And I’m hoping that it will give me a higher starting rate. I know the market is bad right now, but my timeline is about one to two years.",

I can remember what’s important - I don’t think it’s some case of onset dementia at age 30. I’ve just always had trouble retaining information. I’ve been onboarded to do some Data Science / SME work and there’s more professional pressure than earlier in my career. I’ve always gotten good feedback and have a reputation to be a hard worker where I am. But, I constantly forget things I should know. Walk around numbers, some basic querying techniques (window functions / regex), the experience flow of our product.It’s not that I’m being lazy. I write almost everything I hear down. But push comes to shove, in the moment when called on, I often don’t remember simple things that I have jotted down from weeks ago. My roles and responsibilities have greatly expanded since I’ve taken on more DS work, so I’m sure some of it is just trying to learn a firehouse of info (I’m currently learning our biz acumen, our customer experience flow for our product, JSON payloading for our realtime reporting, digital analytics was just picked up for our team, my usual day to day work, some work with our engineers to make sure data is flowing down to us). I don’t want to underestimate that workload. But I’m really frustrated with how stupid I feel, especially on the spot.I’m a pretty anxious person who struggles with confidence. I need to do my job well because that’s a driver of confidence. That’s why I want to learn and absorb everything, so I don’t look stupid. I’ve tried many things - flash cards, writing down notes throughout calls, studying like I’m in school). Just, it never works. It always leaves my head. I don’t feel sharp, even though I work like 50-60 hours and always think about this stuff.I’m just wondering here if anyone has ideas or techniques. I don’t know. There’s sometimes a stigma with not remembering - I often have to tell people I’m being attentive, but just have trouble retaining information, which comes across as weird. I’m just trying to see if anything could work to stay sharp, something I didn’t try, etc. I feel dumb forgetting how to string together data (ie how to calculate customer retention by stringing together events the customer has experienced with a windows function or cte)…..I just always feel inadequate and stupid.

Years later, I went back to school, got a second bachelor’s in CS Online from OSU about 4 years ago, and going to finish my OMSCS from Georgia Tech this fall. I’ve got around 3yoe as a SWE now and am starting to look for new opportunities.I’m just not sure what’s best for my resume, should I keep only the relevant CS degree from OSU and the master’s from Georgia Tech, or include the Berkeley one too? My concern is that listing that first degree I earned 15 years ago might make me look older compared to my experience level (3 YOE), which could create some bias... Or should i omit the graduation date to avoid some age bias? If I leave it off, I’d probably just look like a typical developer in their 20s with around 3 years of experience on paper.What do you think makes the most sense?",
