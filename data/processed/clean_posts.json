        "content": "Hey folks,As part of the Apache Gravitino project, I’ve been contributing to what we call a **“catalog of catalogs”** – a unified metadata layer that sits on top of your existing systems. With 1.0 now released, I wanted to share why I think it matters for anyone in the Databricks / Snowflake ecosystem.**Where Gravitino differs from Unity Catalog by Databricks*** **Open & neutral**: Unity Catalog is excellent inside the Databricks ecosystem. And it was not open sourced until last year. Gravitino is Apache-licensed, open-sourced from day 1, and works across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, S3, ML model registries, and more.* **Extensible connectors**: Out-of-the-box connectors for multiple platforms, plus an API layer to plug into whatever you need.* **Metadata-driven actions**: Define compaction/TTL policies, run governance jobs, or enforce PII cleanup directly inside Gravitino. Unity Catalog focuses on access control; Gravitino extends to automated actions.* **Agent-ready**: With the MCP server, you can connect LLMs or AI agents to metadata. Unity Catalog doesn’t (yet) expose metadata for conversational use.**What’s new in 1.0*** Unified access control with enforced RBAC across catalogs/schemas.* Broader ecosystem support (Iceberg 1.9, StarRocks catalog).* Metadata-driven action system (statistics + policy + job engine).* MCP server integration to let AI tools talk to metadata directly.Here’s a simplified architecture view we’ve been sharing:*(diagram of catalogs, schemas, tables, filesets, models, Kafka topics unified under one metadata brain)***Why I’m excited** Gravitino doesn’t replace Unity Catalog or Snowflake’s governance. Instead, it complements them by acting as a **layer above multiple systems**, so enterprises with hybrid stacks can finally have one source of truth.Repo: [https://github.com/apache/gravitino](https://github.com/apache/gravitino)Would love feedback from folks who are deep in Databricks or Snowflake or any other data engineering fields.

        "content": "Hi everyone, during my internship in a health institute, my main task was to clean up and document medical databases so they could later be used for clinical studies (using DBT and related tools).The problem was that the databases I worked with were really messy, they came directly from hospital software systems. There was basically no documentation at all, and the schema was a mess, moreover, the database was huge, thousands of fields and hundred of tables. Here are some examples of bad design: * No foreign keys defined between tables that clearly had relationships.* Some tables had a column that just stored the *name* of another table to indicate a link (instead of a proper relation).* Other tables existed in total isolation, but were obviously meant to be connected.To deal with it, I literally had to spend my weeks opening each table, looking at the data, and trying to guess its purpose, then writing comments and documentation as I went along.So my questions are:* Is this kind of challenge (analyzing and documenting undocumented databases) something you often encounter in data engineering / data science work?* If you’ve faced this situation before, how did you approach it? Did you have strategies or tools that made the process more efficient than just manual exploration?",

        "content": "I work in a shop where we used to build data warehouses with Informatica PowerCenter. We moved to a cloud stack years back and implemented these complex transformations into Scala in Databricks although we have been doing more and more Pyspark. Over time, we've had issues deploying new gold-tier models in our medallion architecture. Whenever there are highly complex transformations, it takes us a lot longer to develop and deploy. Data quality is lower. Even with lineage graphs, we cannot answer quickly and well for complex derivations if someone asks how we came up with a value in a field. Nothing we do on our new stack compared to the speed and quality when we used to have a good GUI-based ETL tool. Basically myself and 1 other team member could build data warehouses quickly and after moving to the cloud, we have tons of engineers and it takes longer with worse results.What we are considering now is to continue using Databricks for ingest and maybe bronze/silver layers and when building gold layer models with complex transformations, we use a GUI and cloud-based ETL/ELT solution. We want something like the old PowerCenter. Matillion was mentioned. Also, Informatica has a cloud solution.Any advice? What is the best GUI-based tool for ETL/ELT with the most advanced transformations available like what PowerCenter used to have with expression tranformations, aggregations, filtering, complex functions, etc.We don't care about interfaces because data will already be in the data lake. The focus is specifically on very complex transformations and complex business rules and building gold models from silver data.",

        "content": "Hi all! I work on Daft full-time, and since we just shipped a big feature, I wanted to share what’s new. Daft’s been mentioned here a couple of times, so AMA too.Daft is an open-source Rust-based data engine for multimodal data (docs, images, video, audio) and running models on them. We built it because getting data into GPUs efficiently at scale is painful, especially when working with data sitting in object stores, and usually requires custom I/O + preprocessing setups.So what’s new? Two big things. **1. A new distributed engine for running models at scale**We’ve been using Ray for distributed data processing but consistently hit scalability issues. So we switched from using Ray Tasks for data processing operators to running one Daft engine instance per node, then scheduling work across these Daft engine instances. Fun fact: we named our single-node engine “Swordfish” and our distributed runner “Flotilla” (i.e. a school of swordfish).We now also use [morsel-driven parallelism](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) and dynamic batch sizing to deal with varying data sizes and skew.And we have smarter shuffles using either the Ray Object Store or our new Flight Shuffle (Arrow Flight RPC + NVMe spill + direct node-to-node transfer). **2. Benchmarks for AI workloads**We just designed and ran some swanky new AI benchmarks. Data engine companies love to bicker about TPC-DI, TPC-DS, TPC-H performance. That’s great, who doesn’t love a throwdown between Databricks and Snowflake.So we’re throwing a new benchmark into the mix for audio transcription, document embedding, image classification, and video object detection. More details linked at the bottom of this post, but tldr Daft is 2-7x faster than Ray Data and 4-18x faster than Spark on AI workloads.https://preview.redd.it/ohjpa08jyitf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5109e9cb6a8e9ca435b7ec77f522b1830b4d9a72All source code is public.

With new features like canvas and copilot I feel we can make our development quicker and most robust with git integrations.Does informatica integrate well with DBt? Can we kick of DBT loads from informatica after ingesting the data?

I want someone smarter than me around to ask and learn from. The team that I do work closest with are accountants who do not posses the technical background to help me or understand why something can't be done in the way they want. Add on an arrogant manager and this does not mix well.Even if I got a promotion here, it would not change my job duties. I'd still be doing the same thing. I do want more but the job is pretty stable with a decent salary ($80K) and a crazy 401k match (almost 20%).Add on that I do live in a smaller city so remote work might be my only option and given what I've seen how hard it is to get a job these days (and with the decent protections I have as an employee here), I'm afraid of leaving here to just get laid off in the private sector.Not sure what you have all done when you're feeling stuck.TL;DR / I am feeling stuck in my current role of \\~3.5 years as a team of one, want to move up to learn more and grow but afraid of taking the leap and losing out on current benefits.",

        "content": "So, we have multiple dbt projects at my employer, one which has three environments (dev, stage and prod). The issue we're having is merging from the staging env to prod. For reference, in most of our other projects, we simply have dev and prod. Every branch gets tested and reviewed in a PR (we also have a CI environment and job that runs and checks to make sure nothing will break in Prod from changes being implemented) and then merged into a main branch, which is Production. A couple months back we implemented \"stage\" or a UAT environment for one of primary/largest dbt projects. The environment works fine the issue is that in git, once a developer's PR is reviewed and approved in dev and their code is merged into stage, it gets merged into a single stage branch in git. This is somewhat problematic since we'll typically end up with a backlog of changes over time which all need to go to Prod, but not all changes are tested/UAT'd at the same time. So, you end up having some changes that are ready for prod while others are awaiting UAT review. Since all changes in stage exist in a single branch, anything that was merged from dev to stage has to go to Prod all at once. I've been trying to figure out if there's a way to \"cherry pick\" a handful of commits in the stage branch and merge only those to prod in a PR. A colleague suggested using git releases to do this functionality but that doesn't seem to be (based on videos I've watched) what we need. How are people handling this type of functionality? Once your changes go to your stage/uat environment do you have a way of handling merging individual commits to production?",

Genuinely curious what the justification/selling point would be to make the change as they seem to all be extremely comparable overall (at best). Our company is getting sold hard on Fabric but the feature set isn’t compelling enough (imo) to even consider it. Also would be curious if anyone has been on Fabric and switched over to one of the other platforms. I know Fabric has had some issues and outages that may have influenced it, but if there were other reasons I’d be interested in learning more. Note: not intending this to be a bashing session on the platforms, more wanting to see if I’m missing some sort of differentiator between Fabric and the others!",

Currently, I'm fetching data from the YouTube API and storing it in a raw schema table in a Postgres database, with every column stored as a text field except for one. The exception is a column that stores an array of Wikipedia links describing the video.For my staging models in DBT, I decided to assign proper data types to all fields and also split the topics column into its own table. However, after reading the DBT documentation and other resources, I noticed it's generally recommended to keep staging models as close to the source as possible.So my question is: should I keep the array column unnested in staging and instead move the separation into my intermediate or semantic layer? That way, the topics table (a dimension basically) would exist there.",

In yesteryear, business users came to us for dashboards, any ETL needed to power them and basic automation, maybe setting up API clients… so nothing terribly complex. Now the org is going to hire dozens of technical folks who will need to do this kind of thing on their own, and my own team must also transition, for our survival, to being the providers of a central repository for data, customized modules, maybe APIs, etc. For context, my team’s technical level is on average mid level, we certainly aren’t Sr SWEs, but we are excited about this opportunity and have a high capacity to learn. And fortunately, we have access to a wide range of technology. Mainly what would hold us back is our own limited vision and time. So, I think we need to find and follow a playbook for what kind of architecture to learn about and go build, and I’m looking for suggestions on what that might be. TIA!",

        "author": "XxThatWeirdGuyxX",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,I've hit a wall on what seems like a core use case for the modern AWS data stack, and I'm hoping someone here has seen this specific failure mode before. I've been troubleshooting for days and have exhausted the official documentation.My Goal (What I'm trying to achieve): An analyst logs into AWS via IAM Identity Center. They open our Amazon DataZone project (which uses the SageMaker Unified Studio interface). They run a SELECT * FROM customers query against a Redshift external schema. Lake Formation should intercept this and, based on their group membership, return only the 2 columns they are allowed to see (revenue and signup_date).The Problem (The \"Smoking Gun\"): The user (analyst1) can log in and access the project. However, the system is behaving as if Trusted Identity Propagation (TIP) is completely disabled, even though all settings appear correct. I can prove this with two states: 1.If I give the project's execution role (datazone_usr_role_...) SELECT in Lake Formation: The query runs, but it returns ALL columns. The user's fine-grained permission is ignored. 2.If I revoke SELECT from the execution role: The query fails with TABLE_NOT_FOUND: Table '...customers' does not exist. The Data Explorer UI confirms the user can't see any tables. This proves Lake Formation is only ever seeing the service role's identity, never the end user's. The Architecture: •Identity: IAM Identity Center (User: analyst1, Group: Analysts). •UI: Amazon DataZone project using a SageMaker Unified Domain. •Query Engine: Amazon Redshift with an external schema pointing to Glue. •Data Catalog: AWS Glue. •Governance: AWS Lake Formation. What I Have Already Done (The Exhaustive List): I'm 99% sure this is not a basic permissions issue. We have meticulously configured every documented prerequisite for TIP: •Created a new DataZone/SageMaker Domain specifically with IAM Identity Center authentication.•Enabled Domain-Level TIP: The \"Enable trusted identity propagation for all users on this domain\" checkbox is checked. •Enabled Project Profile-Level TIP: The Project Profile has the enableTrustedIdentityPropagationPermissions blueprint parameter set to True. •Created a NEW Project: The project we are testing was created after the profile was updated with the TIP flag. •Updated the Execution Role Trust Policy: The datazone_usr_role_... has been verified to include sts:SetContext in its trust relationship for the sagemaker.amazonaws.com principal. •Assigned the SSO Application: The Analysts group is correctly assigned to the Amazon SageMaker Studio application in the IAM Identity Center console. •Tried All LF Permission Combos: We have tried every permutation of Lake Formation grants to the user's SSO role (AWSReservedSSO_...) and the service role (datazone_usr_role_...). The result is always one of the two failure states described above.My Final Question: Given that every documented switch for enabling Trusted Identity Propagation has been flipped, what is the final, non-obvious, expert-level piece of the puzzle I am missing? Is there a known bug or a subtle configuration in one of these places? •The Redshift external schema itself? •The DataZone \"Data Source\" connection settings? •A specific IAM permission missing from the user's Permission Set that's needed to carry the identity token? •A known issue with this specific stack (DataZone + Redshift + LF)?I'm at the end of my rope here and would be grateful for any insights from someone who has successfully built similar architecture. Thanks in advance!!",

Never got a chance to create something with them.Crux of the matter (My question)-Now I am at a point in my career where I am not feeling confident with MDM as a career. I feel like I am lacking something when I m working. Coding is limited, my thinking is limited to the tool that is being used, I feel like I am playing a workaround simulator with the MDM tool. I am able to understand what is being done, what we are solving, and how we are helping business but I don't get more problem solving. Should I continue on this path?Should I prepare and change my career to data engineering?Why data engineering?- Although MDM is a more specialised branch of data engineering but it is not exactly data engineering. - More career opportunities with data engineering- I feel I will get a sense of satisfaction after working as a data engineer when I solve more problems (grass is always greener on the other side)Can experienced folks give some suggestions?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Dear communityI work on a factsheet-like report which shall be distributed via PDF and therefore I chose Power BI Report Builder which works great for pixel perfect print optimized reports. For PBI Report Builder and my report design in general it is best to work with flat tables. The input comes from various Excel files and I process them with Python in our Lakehouse. That works great. The output column structure is like this:- Hierarchy level 1 (string)- Hierarchy level 2 (string)- Attribute group (string)- Attribute (string)- Value (mostly integers some strings)For calculations in the report it is best to have the value column only being integers. However, some values cannot be expressed as number and are certain keywords instead stored as strings. I thought about having a value_int and value_str column to solve this.Do you have any tips or own experiences? I'm relatively new to data transformations and maybe not aware of some more advanced concepts.Thanks!",

The most annoying issue being that its autogenerated revision file for updates is always just creating every table again, which we haven't been able to solve, so we just have to write it ourselves every time.We use Microsoft SQL Server for our DB if that makes any difference.

        "author": "Material_Direction_1",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Background:I’ve been working as a Data Engineer for about 3.5 years, mainly on data migrations and warehouse engineering for analytics.Even though I’m still technically a junior, for the last couple of years I’ve worked on fairly big projects with a lot of responsibility, often figuring things out on my own and delivering without much help.I’m on £40k and recently started doing a degree alongside work. I’m in a decent position to move up.The company is big but my team is small (1 manager, 1 senior, 2 juniors). It’s generally a good place to work, though promotions and recognition are quite slow — most people move internally to progress. As the other junior and senior are on a single project, I'm doing all others currently.I normally get bored after about a year in a job, but I’ve been here for 2 years and still enjoy most of the work despite a few frustrations.Current situation:My girlfriend lives in Germany (we’ve been together for 4 years), and I want to move there. My current job doesn’t allow working abroad, so I’ll need to find something a way to make it happen. I do fortunately have EU citizenshipI’ve had a few opportunites in Germany. Some looked promising but didn’t work out (e.g. they needed someone to start immediately, or misrepresented parts of the process). Overall, though, I seem to get decent interest.Main issue:A lot of roles in Germany require a degree (I’m working on one but don’t have it yet).Many jobs also want fluent German. Mine is still pretty basic, but I’m learning.I'm considering:EU contracting - I like the idea of doing different projects every 6–12 months while living in Germany. I haven’t looked properly into the legal/tax side yet, but it sounds like it could fit well.Building a product/startup- I’ve built a very basic MVP that provides analytics (including some predictive analysis) for small–mid sized e-commerce companies. It’s early, but I think it could be developed into more of a template/solution to offer as a service potentially.Career progression - I don’t want to stay as a junior any longer and its so low priority for the company currently. I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my side I’m juggling a lot right now: work, uni, the product idea, and the thought of switching to contracting and moving abroad. I want to move things forward without getting stuck in the same place for too long or burning out trying to do everything at once.Any advice on * Moving to Germany as a data professional without fluent German* Whether EU contracting is a good stepping stone or just a distraction right now* If it’s smarter to build the product before or after relocating* General advice on avoiding career stagnation while juggling multiple prioritiesTL;DR:3.5 yrs as a Data Engineer, junior title, £40k, started a degree. Want to move to Germany (girlfriend), progress career, maybe try contracting or build a startup/product. Feels like a lot to juggle and I don’t want to get stuck. Looking for advice from people who’ve been through similar moves or decisions.",

There are separate tools for each part of the data engineering process, which seems unnecessarily complicated and not ideal for small teams.Would anyone benefit from a simple tool that handles raw extracts, allows transformations in SQL, and lets you add data tests at any step in the process—all with a workflow engine that manages the flow end to end?I spent the last few years building a tool that does exactly this. It's not perfect, but the main purpose is to help small data teams get started quickly by automating repetitive pieces of the data pipeline process, so they can focus on complex data integration work that needs more attention.I'm thinking about open sourcing it. Since data engineers really like to tinker, I figure the ability to modify any generated SQL at each step would be important. The tool is currently opinionated about using best practices for loading data (always use a work table in Redshift/Snowflake, BCP for SQL Server, defaulting to audit columns for every load, etc.).Would this be useful to anyone else?",

I wanted to share a new book from Manning that many here will find useful: *Learn AI Data Engineering in a Month of Lunches* by **David Melillo**.The book is designed to help data engineers (and aspiring ones) **bridge the gap between traditional data pipelines and AI/ML workloads**. It’s structured in the *“Month of Lunches”* format — short, digestible lessons you can work through on a lunch break, with practical exercises instead of theory-heavy chapters.[Learn AI Data Engineering in a Month of Lunches](https://preview.redd.it/9vfkgzfkk9sf1.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6061f296f366e6552896ff157b61df20110a7e6)**A few highlights:*** Building **data pipelines for AI and ML*** Preparing and managing datasets for model training* Working with embeddings, vector databases, and large language models* Scaling pipelines for real-world production environments* Hands-on projects that reinforce each conceptWhat I like about this one is that it doesn’t assume you’re a data scientist — it’s written squarely for **data engineers who want to make AI part of their toolkit**.:backhand_index_pointing_right: Save 50% today with code **MLMELILLO50RE** here: [Learn AI Data Engineering in a Month of Lunches](https://hubs.la/Q03LsPp70)Curious to hear from the community: **how are you currently approaching AI/ML workloads in your pipelines?** Are you experimenting with vector databases, LLMs, or keeping things more traditional?Thank you all for having us.Cheers,",

I often hear that being self-taught can make it more difficult to land jobs, especially when competing against candidates with computer science degrees.What I’d really like to understand is: what specific advantages do CS graduates have over self-taught programmers? Beyond just holding the degree itself, what knowledge or skills do they typically gain in school that gives them an edge? Is it mainly the deeper understanding of core concepts and fundamentals?Also, if anyone has recommendations for resources that cover the theoretical side of programming, I’d love to know. I want to round out my self-taught journey with the kind of foundational knowledge that’s usually taught in a degree program.",

But learning to *read* code well is just as important as writing it. I have a few actionable tips to get started with reading code* Make a mental map of the functions: * When your going through the code always try a high level outline of the file and then build on that towards. Like for example, start at the top of the file and go through the functions clicking on them to go towards the source code* Run the code through a debugger : * One of the underrated ways to understand a codebase is to run the code that you are reading through a debugger. Attach a breakpoint and the simulate running the code, you will understand the flow of the code extremely well.* Start from the test cases: * If the project has test cases, that’s your entry point. Run them and *watch what happens*. * What objects are being created? * Which functions are called first? * What files are imported?Learning to read code well takes time. You won’t understand everything the first time and that’s okay. But if you repeat this process across 3/4 small projects, your brain starts to see code structure naturally.",

I don't understand why router would have to go though looking into layer 3, and instead of just giving layer 3 info to switch, it has to encapsulate it again and give layer 2 packet to the switch for it to work properly.I know switch requires the mac address to operate and it is layer 2 thing.

        "content": "Hello everyone. New user here :)>They say that learning programming from a good course (or book) is far more important than the choice of the language (for a novice about to enter the world of programming).Let's say an autodidact wants to learn C++ via Stroustrup's [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html) book but is instead recommended to learn programming through one of the popular and highly regarded online courses like [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) or [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/). What will be more beneficial here? Is it moving forward with CS50 or TOP or starting the C++ book as originally intended?I've always seen this idea reiterated quite often that choosing a programming language for a novice is not as important as it is to choose a good course that teaches the fundamentals of programming. But then you would eventually loose your time re-learning your target language. So I'm a bit confused and wanted to hear the opinions of intermediate and experienced programmers on this particular statement.Do you agree with this mentality of learning the fundamentals without being hyper-fixated about the language or do you think that learning your target language is more important from the get-go?Thanks in advance <3",

I have most of the skills necessary when it comes to this like 3d modeling, drawing, animation and sound. However I lack the most essential skill, coding. I use unity, which means I code in c#, and I have tried learning it so many times but every time i have tried to learn either I resort to chatgpt or other peoples code or i just give up. I feel terrible using chatgpt because its just not good, it ruins a game because it was made by a clanker ai robot instead of a real human being and I don't want to be like that, but every time I have ever tried to make a game or learn how to code I have given up. The furthest I have learnt in c# right now is variables, logic gates, events and basic 2d movement along with rigidbody 2d movement but nothing else, and I just want to give up all the time and have been giving up then trying again then giving up over and over and over for the past like 4 years and idk what to do at this point. So if anybody has a solution please pretty please with a cherry on top tell me. Youtube videos never worked for me, i tried learning with chatgpt, that didn't work either, i have talked to other people who know how to code and that didnt work, just about nothing works for me. I even wrote notes on c# in my book and thats how I know about variables, logic gates, events etc but theres honestly so much crap in coding i just get lost :(",

It’s a search engine with a UI that can search across file types — PDFs and images, using either the in-app screenshotting feature or paths of the queries — and supports quick metadata editing on the matched results. It also uses SQLite database that can realistically handle up to a million files, and FAISS for indexing.It’s not production-ready yet, and it gets a bit buggy when stress-tested, but the core features are there and working as intended. I’ve put a lot of time into it and learned a ton, but I know I’m missing real-world experience — like working with a team, writing scalable code, and having people who actually know what they’re doing point out where I’m going wrong.I’m hoping to land an internship to gain that experience and also earn a bit to help pay for my tuition fees as I'm only 2 years into my CS journey as a student. Do you think a project like this is enough to get my foot in the door? Has anyone here landed an internship based on a personal project or PoC? How did you pitch it, and what did you focus on?Would love to hear your thoughts or advice!",

I.E. Scan a file into the DB once, add relevant data to a DB (like sqlite), maybe a few jobs to maintain the quality of the DB data, and do the rest from reading the DB?Or am I over thinking this?",

I could do things like control where each of the 4 corner points are and then use trig and other math to programmatically animate them.I miss it. I do stuff with the HTML canvas and enjoy that, but Flash was much more robust.Whenever I'd have like an IT person telling me that Flash sucked I would automatically think \"Well, they clearly do not know what they are talking about.\" Their criticism is about security and performance issues. It's a valid criticism. Flash had a lot of vulnerabilities because it gave freedom to the software engineer. Freedom which could be abused.There are certainly more business advantages to other types of software. I miss the math of it though. I'm kinda retired now so instead of trying to find a substitute, I enjoy making partial substitutes with Visual Studio.",

I’m doing mine alone and decided to create an app that would have a catalog of workouts and even create a routine for you. Thing is I don’t know much about coding apps so I decided to make it web based. But I don’t even know how to do that. I know a little bit about the foundations of python because of a class I took. It was accelerated so we didn’t go too much in depth. I feel like I need more practice and I think I would have to learn JavaScript for my project as well. I don’t know how to start since I’ve never made a project before. There was a guy next to me who talked about his project and said he would be creating a chatbot on discord and would use youtube tutorials to help. Can I do that? That sounds like cheating. The club founder also mentioned looking for projects similar to mine and just writing down the code and adding any features I want for my project. Wouldn’t it be better to make it from scratch? That itself sounds difficult. I have until december I believe to make it. Would that be enough time to get better at Python, JS, and make the project or should I look for a different project?",

It obviously istn't though. What can I do to fix this issue? And what is causing it in the first place. I believe my function is correct. 2. Another problem is in the following if-statement: if (n == 1 || m == 1) {return false; }where \"return false;\" shows the following error message: \" a postcondition could not be proved on this return pathVerifierthis is the postcondition that could not be provedPraktikum1und2_Wiederholung.dfy(188, 21): [**Error:**](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/valen/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) a postcondition could not be proved on this return path Could not prove: `coprime == (forall x | 2 <= x < n :: !(divides(x, n) && divides(x, m)))` This is assertion #1 of 18 in [batch](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/valen/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) \\#1 of 2 in method `arecoprime`\"I don't understand why the postcondition couldn't be proven. What can I change to get rid of the error? 3. A general problem of mine is that I don't quite understand how I can find necessary postconditions.

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m currently working on a side project: I want to build a web application for recipe management. Originally, I thought about making a native iOS app, but I quickly realized how complicated and restrictive it is to develop and deploy apps on iOS without going through a lot of hurdles. So instead, I want to start with a web app.The idea:* Add recipes manually (via text input).* Import recipes from [chefkoch.de](https://www.chefkoch.de/) automatically.* Store and manage them in a structured way (ingredients, preparation steps, total time, tags, etc.).For the import, I found this Python package [https://pypi.org/project/python-chefkoch/2.1.0/](https://pypi.org/project/python-chefkoch/2.1.0/)But when I try to use it, I run into an error. Here’s my minimal example:`from chefkoch.recipe import Recipe``recipe = Recipe('https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/1069361212490339/Haehnchen-Ananas-Curry-mit-Reis.html')``print(recipe.total_time)`And this is the traceback: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"C:\\Users\\xxx\\Documents\\Programmieren\\xxx\\github.py\", line 4, in print(recipe.total_time) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \"C:\\Users\\xxx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\Lib\\functools.py\", line 1026, in __get__ val = self.func(instance) File \"C:\\Users\\xxx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\Lib\\site-packages\\chefkoch\\recipe.py\", line 193, in total_time time_str = self.__info_dict[\"totalTime\"] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^ KeyError: 'totalTime'It looks like the `totalTime` key is missing from the recipe’s info dictionary. Maybe the site changed their structure since the package was last updated?My goal is to extract:* preparation time,* cooking time,* total time,* ingredients,* instructions,* maybe also tags/keywords.Has anyone worked with this library recently or knows a better way to parse recipes from Chefkoch? Should I instead scrape the site myself (e.g. with BeautifulSoup) or is there a more up-to-date package that I missed?As I'm a newbie, any advice would be appreciated",

Been looking at their code reviews and I often notice that it's about 90% LLM generated code that are often complicated, out of context, unnecessary addons and stuffs like that. While coaching them on 1:1, I notice they struggle to meet the basic SDE standards that are well within the scope of a new CS grad or at least something that is easy to find in internet.For example - there's a dude that wasn't able to understand that a javascript function can return another function and not just a concrete value/object. He also asked me how a basic lodash function work - which is basically 1 google search away. Another dude was not able to explain his thought process on the code he wrote because I found that there is no relevance of the change he made for the feature development that was assigned. So, on a high level, I have observed that they cannot grasp the understanding of the system, have patience to read through documentations, question what it does and how to think of when writing code. Now, there could be a couple of possibilities on this. First, maybe they are overwhelmed and feel like they need to push gold standard code from month 1, else they get fired. The brutal job market might be making them scared to lose the job and is presurring them to show up as an expert already. Second, maybe the ChatGPT really ruined their critical thinking ability and attention span for reading through documentations / articles. Third, could it be the toxic work culture at FAANG where there's a pressure of proving yourself to avoid layoffs? I am curious if the situation is same across all companies.",

My reviews are great at work. I just... don't have the drive to work extra hard to reach senior level, much less staff/principal.I compare myself to when I was a new grad. Going to many tech events, networking, improving my Leetcode skills and constantly interviewing to improve my interview skills and to see what opportunities are available to grow or reach higher. I would read books, do side projects, keep up with the latest news and trends. My goal at the time was eventually become a staff/principal level dev earning 150-200k a year 10 years down the road. My hard work eventually paid off, I went from a no-name school to a few scrappy startups to better mid level company and eventually hit a big tech remote job. Been here three years now and I'm honestly content. Old me would have pushed for a promotion by year 1 (with an expectation of failure but that's okay! I tried to get internships my first semester in school too lol). I thought I'd \"rest\" from the grind for a bit and now 3 years have passed. Will probably reach year 4 without a promotion though my compensation has grown quite a bit regardless. I don't even interview around anymore (as that's one way to get to senior too!) Part of it seems to be that, from a compensation stand point, I had reached the upper band of my goal the moment I got the big tech job and am now at a point where I overshot it by more than 50%. I absolutely do not have the momentum to reach staff/principal in the next 5 years anymore.Anyone in the same boat? Anyone who was in the same boat and got out of it? What eventually changed your mindset?",

        "content": "Maybe I was naive at the time, but early in my career (early 2010s), it seemed like companies knew what they were doing a lot more. At my first two or three companies, the CEOs all had the same story: they came from outside of tech and decided to make software to solve some problem that they were having. They could clearly explain what the problems they were trying to solve were, and how the solution did thatThis seemed also true at bigger companies. Companies like google or netflix were at least *trying* to make products that appealed to consumers, even if it wasn't always a hit. Companies seemed to be run fairly well, or they were at least stable day to day. There was also lots of \"aspirational\" jobs, like places where if you got a job there, it felt like you hit the lotteryNowadays things just... don't really seem like that. It seems like every single company has *terrible* leadership. AI integration into *everything* seems like a good example, I don't know a single person in my life who has ever wanted to use one of these things, most (like me) find them actively annoying. Some of their ideas just seem really out there. Like how Zuckerberg was talking about making a social network where you interact with AI companions. ... Why would I ever want that?The companies just generally seem to be run more poorly. Vaguely communicated (if communicated at all) long term goals, seemingly no direction or conviction, no desire to compete and a seeming indifference to customer needs. Sometimes it even feels like they have an actively antagonistic view of their customers and people in general. Working at pretty much *any* company seems miserable",

All new hires are now being made in India, and there have been a few layoffs here in the US, even though the company’s financial health remains strong.Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding H1B visas, I’ve decided that moving to India is the best choice for both my personal and professional stability.

Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about whether I should start studying again to brush up on algorithms and system design so I can pivot back into a dev-heavy role. But at the same time, I feel like I’m behind compared to people who never left the technical track. Most nights I end up playing myprize instead of actually sitting down to practice. For those of you who’ve drifted into less technical roles, did you manage to transition back? If so, how did you go about it without feeling like you were starting from scratch?",

This is obviously against the countless clarification that's been published, so I asked where heard that. They said company announcement and emails from the law firm that the company pays.That's why Big Tech has is keeping its mouth shut about the 100k H1B fees. It won't affect the majority of their hiring, not transfers, not F1, etc. but they can use the panic to insinuate that it does to suppress wages. \"You should be grateful we're paying this fee, and other employers might not when you switch jobs.\" You didn't pay shit, and neither would anyone else. \"Now we have to pay everyone less to cover the fees, blah blah blah bs\"The 100k \"fee\" is a win for Big Tech because their hiring is untouched by it and allows them to keep wages low by manipulating their H1Bs into thinking switching cost is even higher. I bet they're actively lobbying for the fee to apply to job switch. Anyone else seeing this bullshit?",

When I ask why, they say it just didn't help with the actual problem.Therapy works but it's expensive (I charge $200/hour), and not everyone can afford that, especially for prevention before things get really bad.The specific things my clients struggle with:\\- They know intellectually they need boundaries, but don't know HOW to actually set them\\- They feel guilty saying no to their manager\\- They can't stop checking Slack at 10pm even though they know they should\\- Their entire identity is wrapped up in their job, so when work goes badly, they feel like failures as peopleI'm exploring building some digital tools my clients could use between therapy sessions. Not to replace therapy, but to make it more accessible and affordable.My questions for you:1. Does this resonate? Do you struggle with similar things?2. What would actually be helpful? (Specific tools, exercises, scripts, etc.)3. How much would you be willing to pay for something that actually works?4. What would make you stick with it vs abandoning it after a week like Calm?I'm genuinely trying to understand what the gap is between what exists and what people actually need.Thanks for any insights.",

        "content": "10 YoE, have explored various specialties and currently working for an AI tooling/infrastructure company. We're doing quite well, but man, I just feel like shit whenever I think too hard about it. This stuff barely works, it's barely getting any better, and the economic, environmental, and social costs of producing it are exploding exponentially.Before this, I worked at a company that did electronics manufacturing for various large corporations. We were poorly-run and a godawful waste of money. Before that, a company that made software that assisted in fracking. Before that, a company that staffed fucking *call centers*. I used to think that these were stepping stones to a meaningful job, but... I don't know what that would be, at this point. Maybe I could go work in clean energy? Or on theoretical AI research that might eventually yield more useful advances? Or... something else? I don't know.I love working on software. And when I was younger I really believed that I could make good money doing this, **and** do something that mattered at the same time. Now... I feel like I won't be morally clean unless I give all my money to charity and go become a monk and wear a hair shirt. I know that's ridiculous, I know it's black-and-white thinking, but I haven't found a good framework for working out the moral calculus here.It's even more exhausting because it seems like nobody in the industry of any note **cares** about any of this. It feels like I'm surrounded by people who believe that if we *just keep building,* something amazing will fall out -- as if these people didn't just live through the fucking crypto bubble and the rise of social media before that. The only high-profile people I hear talking about a moral hazard are the AI doomers, who are so infatuated with an imaginary apocalypse that they can't be bothered to think about the boring work of improving the real world. I know, this is a rant. To try to turn it into something more directed: have any of you felt this way and gotten back to a place where you felt good about what you do? If you did, did it involve changing jobs? What are you working on now?",

        "author": "diabloallica",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Earlier this year, I shared a post about my *brutal job search season* — 7 years of experience, 0 offers, and a Sankey diagram of all my failures. At that time, I was struggling to get traction despite a ton of effort, and the funnel felt brutal. (For anyone curious, here’s the old post: [Brutal Job Search Season Recap - 7 YOE, 0 Offers, and a Sankey Diagram of My Failures : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1irlf8b/brutal_job_search_season_recap_7_yoe_0_offers_and/))This time around, things went much better. With \\~7.5 years of experience at a major cloud company, I decided to give the market another shot, and the difference was noticeable. I ended up landing **5 job offers, all at a higher level than my current role**, and had far more interview opportunities with larger, well-known companies compared to my last search.**What Changed Since Last Time:*** **Market conditions:** Hiring still isn’t easy, but compared to earlier this year, there’s clearly more activity. The bar is high, but not *as impossibly high*.* **Interview prep:** I doubled down on my weak spots. Coding used to be my #1 rejection reason. I kept grinding on patterns, mock interviews, and actually slowing down to talk through my thinking. That helped a lot.* **Mindset:** Last time, every rejection hit me hard. This time, I treated each round as “just another rep,” which helped me stay consistent across system design and behavioral interviews.**Results:*** Multiple onsites and final-round loops.* 5 actual offers on the table (finally!).* A more balanced funnel: coding wasn’t the auto-fail it used to be, and system design performance felt steadier.**Takeaways:**1. The market does ebb and flow. Timing matters more than we admit.2. Interviewing is a skill that compounds. The “wasted” interviews from earlier weren’t really wasted; they set me up to do better this time.3. Having \\~7 years of experience doesn’t exempt you from practicing fundamentals. But it *does* give you more stories and perspective for behavioral/design rounds.Curious: has anyone else noticed interviews feeling slightly more reasonable lately? Or was this just lucky timing?**New Sankey diagrams:**[https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg](https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg) \\- Without any failure reason categorization [https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2](https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2) \\- With weighted failure reason categorization",

This has caused me to perpetuate the AI fear myself and for that I feel pretty shitty. I even contemplated throwing my CS degree away and becoming an electrician. I’m deciding after this post, I will monitor responses for 24 hours and then delete Reddit, stop looking at TeamBlind, and stop watching YouTube doom videos. I will completely ignore all of this for the next 6 months and focus on becoming a better developer. Will it be a waste of my time? Maybe. But I have come to realize all I can do is the best I can, I can’t control the future.

I got a mostly positive response to that mostly pessimistic post. I updated based on recent data and expanded to cover industries that rely on Tech and Quant related skills. I’ll repost to finance careers as well this time.In my original post, I shared that in my experience the job market largely reflects confidence that earnings growth will outpace inflation and bond markets. Here’s the S&P 500  [YOY RE growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-quarter) over the last nine months:* Mar 31, 2025  10.58%* Dec 31, 2024  6.15%* Sep 30, 2024  6.11%* Jun 30, 2024  5.12%[Real M2 Money Supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2REAL) appears to have also reverted back to a normal rate of growth from before the pandemic. That, in addition to the earnings growth, should start a return to a “normal” job market. Unfortunately, back-to-normal is taking longer than anyone wants.I poked around a little more and noticed the following trend for S&P 500 [YOY Real Sales Per Share growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-sales-growth/table/by-quarter) over that same time period:* Mar 31, 2025  2.25%* Dec 31, 2024  2.24%* Sep 30, 2024  2.75%* Jun 30, 2024  1.95%That suggests that companies realized earnings growth not through sales but instead through cost cutting by presumably reducing headcount. I posted a public [dashboard on FRED that shows headcount growth flatlining](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/dashboard/121649) (you can create your own economic dashboard on FRED).Unfortunately, I don’t think lower rates alone from the Fed will be enough. Also, unlike what I wrote in my original post, I don’t think there are any safe jobs or companies. Here are some other larger trends I’ve begun looking at - I am curious if others on Reddit agree or disagree:1. Between security concerns, software as a service, and low/no code customization, the number of products and versions have shrunk. Hence, companies have eliminated many jobs patching older versions of SW or journeyman jobs maintaining custom code.2. Overall, [the number of publicly traded companies has shrunk](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LDOM.NO?locations=US) since the 1990s. If it wasn’t for SPACs, the numbers would likely have gone even further lower. With fewer companies, M&A, auditing, compliance, and finance all rely on less and less headcount.3. The [increase in college educated professionals](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MJlq) has diluted the unique value of any college degree. Even if you suspended H1B and OPT roles, it wouldn’t change the scale at which college educated professionals now participate in the job market relative to what they did 20 years ago.Growth in public companies followed public market deregulation by Reagan in the 1980s and not regulating the internet starting with Clinton in the 1990s (Sec 230). I think we’re similarly at a point where we need to assess the structure/incentives of market regulation across the board.",

There was some guy from my uni a few years older than me who did some drug dealing and ended up getting arrested. So while things do look economically bleak for me (and likely many others), at least I've got retained enough integrity not to end up turning to a life of crime and getting saddled on drugs (yet).It's not like I personally know this person though. He just happened to attend my school. Absolute rock bottom might be Luigi from last winter (who has a MS CS), but I'm pretty confident most people don't personally know him.Most people I know are students lol, my age or younger. All my tech classmates who have graduated before me (2025 or earlier) are gainfully and relevantly employed to at least some extent right now.In terms of people I actually know, mine would have to be one friend's sibling who majored in IT and hardly cared about anything, who right now just has a remote help desk job that pays less than McDonald's. At least it's not only paid but domain-relevant, and I'm sure many grads would be dying to be in a similar situation. My friend told me their sibling *could* upskill to IT Engineer if they just put in the effort but they just choose not to. Still, it's an IT help desk that pays peanuts, and wouldn't have even required a degree a few years ago.",

        "content": "Hi all,I’m finishing up a PhD in CS at a top U.S. school (think Stanford, MIT, CMU, or Berkeley). I recently received an industry offer that isn’t research-oriented (no publications involved), and I’m torn between taking it and graduating soon or going on the academic job market.For context, I have 10+ first-author papers at top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) with around 400 citations in total. My advisor says I’m one of the best students they’ve had in the past decade and that I should be able to land a tenure-track position at a top institution.In terms of compensation, I can expect around $400–500K total in industry (with a $300K base). Assistant professors in my field at top schools seem to start around $160–180K including summer support and benefits. Tenured associate professors make roughly $220K+, full professors around $280K+, and side consulting can add a meaningful amount on top of that.Here’s my dilemma: I’m completely burned out from the publish-or-perish sprint. It feels impossible to truly rest from research, it follows you even into your dreams. I also sometimes feel empty producing papers that don’t seem to have much real-world relevance. Maybe things would get better once I settle into a tenure-track position with more autonomy, but I’m not sure. I don’t hate research, but the passion I once had for it is gone. These days, it feels more like a job I need to perform well in general at rather than something I’m genuinely excited about.That said, I absolutely love the flexibility and freedom academia offers. Being able to set my own schedule, take time off when needed, and choose topics that genuinely interest me has been invaluable. You also get summers (mostly) off from teaching and service, plus sabbaticals down the line. Most importantly, I find mentoring and teaching students incredibly meaningful in a way that publishing papers never has been. That’s the kind of “impact” that actually feels real to me.So… how do you decide between academia and industry when the pros and cons barely overlap? And is it reasonable to pursue an academic career if you don’t love research anymore, but deeply enjoy teaching and mentoring?I know no one can make this decision for me, but I’m feeling pretty lost right now and would really appreciate any perspectives or advice.Thanks a lot for reading.",

Just to be clear my 5YOE ranges from backend coding to managing IAM federation application. Wish I had more CI/CD experience because that’s what employers seem to want in my experience.",

        "content": "I’ve been a .NET dev at an enterprise company for \\~7 months. The first 6 months were mostly pair programming, asking a ton of questions, and learning repos/design patterns/deployment/PR norms and processes. Now I’m more confident and can grab easier sprint cards and work through them (usually still pairing with seniors when it’s a new type of task).My long term goal is to work at a FAANG level company and I’m trying to figure out how to speed up my growth as an engineer. Right now I:* Take notes from pairing/questions* Study a backlog of C#/.NET concepts I don’t know well (background is Python/TS → learning interfaces, DI, DDD, mocking, MediatR, EF, etc.)* Push myself to grab harder cards, make a plan, review it with a senior, then try to solve it soloIt feels like my growth path is just: take cards, ask or research questions on designs or concepts, repeat. If I am trying to level up up as fast as possible, should I be trying to do as many cards as possible or carving out time each day for structured foundational learning?I also leetcode on the side for an hour a day as a long term plan for FAANG interviews. Part of me wonders if that time would be better spent focused on improving as a SWE at my current job and making my resume stronger. But at the same time, DSA feels like a skill I’ll need regardless and I want to be able to ace OAs / coding rounds in the future.For those of you who’ve seen juniors rise fast: what did they do differently? And should I be emphasizing job growth instead of long term interview prep?",

        "author": "decorumic",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently got a job offer this week that I honestly never thought I’d get. It’s a SWE role at a pretty well-known Web3 company with a more than 30% total comp increase (about 265k vs my current 200k) and it's fully remote. The only catch is it's likely going to be intense with tight sprints, and fast-paced. I heard that they have a culture where people typically stay 1–2 years before moving on. But it's definitely a good place to make money.My **c**urrent job has pretty good job security at a company that works for the G. If I were to be honest to myself, I only do about 5 hours of real work per day. I go to the office twice a week for 30 mins each way. There are downsides (occasional confusion from unstructured sprints, tedious work, little growth), but overall it’s comfortable. But if I leave this job, it's quite difficult to return if I ever regret.The thing is I’ve always had this itch and dream of building my own product or small business someday. My logic was that this comfortable job would give me the time and space to pursue that dream. But in realityI haven’t much, just a tiny bit. I’ve been spending my extra time moving places, doing hobbies, or just unwinding.It makes me question if I can even trust myself to use free time productively for a side business. I don’t even have a concrete idea yet, just vague thoughts about building a micro-SaaS, but the market’s competitive and I’m not sure what problem to tackle.So now I’m torn because if I stay, I get comfort, stability, low stress but I risk stagnation and feel stupid leaving a lot of money on the table. And if I leave, I get more money, growth, and momentum but likely lose my free time and might burn out kept thinking of not scratching my itch.I’m nearing 40 already, so I also think about whether I should be prioritising stability or taking one last big career leap while I still can while I'm starting a family at the same time.How should I even decide especially for the long term?",

The reason I'm asking is because I don't have a degree and I'm thinking about getting a cyber security or computer science degree from WGU. The second reason I'm asking is because a lot of the IT jobs are on site or hybrid and since I live in a small town, I have to drive an hour both ways everyday, which is exhausting. And of course the pay is higher in software engineering than it is in IT. One last thing, since I have experience in IT and do security (pentesting) training on my own as a hobby (CTF's), I could get the cybersecurity degree in about 7 to 8 months. Whereas the computer science degree would take me at least a year and a half.",

I’m considering options like WGU, or a Canadian university program that has a co-op component and try getting internships in big companies?

Java? Python? Go? The market where I live is messed up, and I feel like I need some guidance from someone older than me, and all the people I work with in my company are dinosaurs with outdated knowledge.I feel like I'm missing out by not working in a microservice project with a better stack than PHP.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have been in the programming industry about five+ years on only an Associate’s degree. Where I am at in my technology career is that I am a reputable programmer, known as a high performer, who is now being considered for leadership roles in our software product team of increasing responsibility. Because my previous roles had me at the intersection of business and technology, my goal (known by my management team) is to eventually transition to the \"business side\" of our team/very well known company. I know that ideally I need to get credentials other than an associates degree, given today's market. I’ve been pricing out a CS Bachelor's degree and the time it would take to finish... I’m looking at like 3.5 years and $65k. That’s a lot. While I was doing this, I ended up coming across an opportunity to complete a Master’s Degree in CS (it is a performance based admissions which accepts applicants w/o a bachelor’s) at a reputable, accredited school  (CU Boulder Online) for 1/2 the time and a fraction of the cost.I know that given my current career trajectory, having that Master's would be really helpful to me. I also have credits in business that are transferrable, and found out that I could get an online BS in business from WGU in a relatively short amount of time (less than one year). Would having a Master's degree in CS without a CS bachelor (instead bachelor would be in business) be a detriment to me in applying/changing jobs/getting my resume through an ATS system in the future for tech and related roles that I cannot think of at the moment?I am just afraid that not having the CS Bachelor would be a deterrent. I am over 30 and being able to do these degrees online and specifically have the technology degree being \"higher level\" to match my skill set, would make it a lot easier to get through.  I figured this is an OK strategy, but I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot…maybe someone can see a risk that I can't.Thank you!P.S. - Edited to add:  My friend who is a manager said that the Master's would be good for leveling up in our system, but that it could potentially exclude me from job reqs that require a BS in CS... so that is what has me nervous about going down this path. However, I have been seeing more job posts in our system for 'Bachelor's Degree' and it doesn't say any specific disipline, whereas before many of our postings would say Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or Higher/Equivalent Experince. Our company is also very open to people with 'different' backgrounds as long as they can 'prove' they have the skills to do the work. With this in mind, do you think purely getting the Master's is a determent (and BS in CS is better) or is it a worthwhile path to pursue to get the MS as I have already planned? Thank you!",

He’s been writing a program for about two years for one of our data tasks. It’s terrible. Like the dude is passing images into pandas dataframes and then iterating over the dataframe. To run the program once would take around 75 hours. I managed to cut it down to just under an hour. It’s not accurate either but that’s a story for another time.Well this superior says he wants to run his code. If we have any ideas for changes to the code we need to run it by him for him to change. Even regarding the massive runtime cut I had, he would prefer to make the changes himself. The issue is 1.) he’s not good at coding 2.) he’s extremely busy so a simple change might take an entire week. My boss told me to just change the code without letting him know. He and a few others have done this in the past before (this superior is typically weird like this about his code). I feel bad because I am pretty close with this superior on a personal/irl level and I’m also a bit fearful he’ll see the changes at some point and get mad. Not sure what to do about this.",

It seems like for big tech, mathematically, about 5% would make sense because you have the long interview loops afterwards to sort it down to 0.1-0.2% for offer rate. For midtier/startups, maybe 2%, with 5-10% of those getting offers? Of course this will vary based on school and prior experience, but does this sound about right on average? It confuses me seeing some people with experience/target schools apply to thousands and get 1 response while others with neither get 20 interviews out of 500 applications. Maybe a lot of the ones without much luck are international. Does anyone have anything to add?Bonus question: If you're really really good at leetcode, like top 2% and can solve pretty much any unseen medium/hard in 25 minutes, is this typically enough to get into big tech or at least upper-middle tech within a couple years with an average resume?",

I've also found that I've been losing skills or knowledge over time. I've been going to school part time and forgetting stuff that I did a couple of years ago. I just feel so demotivated and dispassionate from sitting down to do Leetcode problems or something. I find myself unable to solve some of the most basic questions.I'm asking because I'm not sure if this is me just finding these uninteresting to solve, working in languages I'm not comfortable with, being out of 'the game' for awhile so to speak, or just slowly realizing that CS isn't for me. Which sucks because this was supposed to be my ticket into doing more interesting work that would also provide financial stability for me.

        "content": "I went to a T10 university for undergrad and did applied math & economics, wanted to work in tech but graduated into a horrible market so decided to do a masters in CS (ML focused) afterwards at the same university, then graduated into an even worse market. Spent months looking for a job and eventually landed a job in model risk at the associate level at a T1 bank in NYC focused on AI/ML models. This *felt* tech-adjacent enough that, as someone who had been searching for a job for a long time, I felt like I was obligated to take it. So I did.The role is ok. Definitely boring, only a bit of coding but alot of looking at code. It's close enough to the models themselves that I feel like I'm maintaining my technical chops. But I'm realizing that being at a bank is just not for me and I want to do something closer to the action. I've only been here for a few months but I fully intend to try and leave model risk after a year or two at this job.Not gonna lie, I've been kind of spiraling a bit lately since I've been scared that I've already boxed myself into a risk/compliance archetype that'll make it impossible to pivot to anything more exciting. Part of this is just the fact that model risk is an area thats kind of unique to banks and thus less transferable, but my cope is that since I'm working with AI/ML models more than financial models, that makes me marginally more \"tech-adjacent\" if you will. Ideally I would land a role in as a PM or TPM in AI/Responsible AI, as those *feel* like more natural pivots than trying to immediately start coding full-time again, but I worry about how my background will be perceived.This is my first full time role. Maybe I'm just overestimating how rigid career trajectories and exit opportunities and those things are. I just don't wanna be stuck doing this for the rest of my life. Yeah it pays pretty well but it's not fulfilling or exciting. Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated on how I should try to approach the next year or so to angle myself best",

Perhaps the low response rates are due to lack of qualifications on the candidate's part (ie, newly grads applying for experienced roles), or maybe the market is tough for entry-level jobs but not as bad for experienced roles. Either way, I'm curious to see if anyone has actually gotten offers recently (and if you may, tell us as much as you are comfortable about the role and your background).

You can introduce them to peers who may be looking to hire or help potential interns practice before they interview or even show them the process. Again it’s up to you if you feel comfortable here as well. Sometimes people will just reach out for blanket intros because they just spray and pray and it’s ok to say no.

Of the 4 challenges they flagged me on, I didn't even start one of them! I didn't even open that challenge.

I did well enough in this degree that they hired me as a undergraduate TA to teach tutorials and grade exams for 3 out of the 5 years of my undergrad. I graduated right into the height of the pandemic so at the time, with the uncertainty of how the pandemic would shake everything up, even though I was looking for a job in data science or related fields, I took the first thing I could get. The first job I got was related to front-end web development at a government agency and I stayed there for 5 years. I was a top performer for the last few years of my employment there (always got glowing reviews from my managers), but since front-end was something I kind of fell into, I decided to go back to school for CS and so started applying for schools again last September. Additionally, I have a younger sibling that was accepted to Google as a SWE this past year, so that gave me extra inspiration to work on myself.Right before I started school again this month, my team was made redundant and I was laid off. I was hoping to work there at least one more year while I took part time studies (I am part time for my first year as my math and stats degree requirements have all transferred and my gen-ed requirements waived), but fortunately I have enough savings to get me through my entire degree. My current school (York University) is probably a tier-2 equivalent school (if you would consider the University of Toronto a tier 1 school). However, I want to do co-op which would extend my second degree to 4 years. Between co-op and EI (which I applied for as I am a part time student) I will have some financial buffer. But what I'm truly worried about is the CS market still being absolute shit by the time I graduate. I tell myself that this market downturn is only temporary as advancements in AI will most likely plateau, maybe the government down south stabilizes and the economy with it too, and like all market downturns there will be a time where it resurges but that's never a certainty.If it were just me I think I would be able to manage. But my parents are getting up there in age and I'm afraid that if I can't get a job as soon as I graduate then I won't be able to support them when they retire. What is the best way for me, currently, to best maximize my employment chances as soon as I graduate (in terms of CS fields focus on) - given that I have a math and stats background I think either AI or Fintech would be my best options. I will network and do side projects. Ultimately the dream would be to join my younger sibling in working at a FAANG but for now I just need to maximize my chances at quick employment after graduation. I'm hoping my previous experience and math/stats background will set me apart from other fresh grads when the time comes.",

I see people say “if I can’t get a job offer or internship I will just go to grad school”, as if this route is smarter financially. Grad school is incredibly expensive, federal aid is non existent for grad students, scholarships incredibly difficult to come by, and loans carry high interest rates. How in any way is this better than graduating, working a temporary job while continuing to code and build projects and apply to jobs?During school we must build side projects because the degree is in computer science not software engineering, the paper is not enough. If this is the case, why would post graduation be any different in that you would work a normal job and continue to grind. Are internships impossible to come by after graduation? If you graduate without internship experience you are somehow walled away because internships are a prerequisite to swe junior rolls? I would imagine you could find a gig even at a small company. Even if it took a while, your progress would still be faster because you’re not pushing the goalpost back two years. I’m just curious to hear from those with this opinion how continuing education is the safer route. If you’ve read this thank you and I look forward to your input.",

I do wish to pursue my PhD in quantitative or industrial/organizational psychology but I’m obtaining masters just for a stronger data science and quantitative background outside of statistics. In the case I don’t get in this cycle I do wish to get into data scientist/analyst or researcher roles.Right now I’m taking data mining, data analytics tools and scripting, mathematics for data science, and programming with python (this is a bridge course for those that don’t have a strong programming background)Not even half way through the semester and this masters is kicking my butt along with my other classmates (even those who come from a computer science background). When it comes to the mathematics I feel like it’s doable. I feel like when programming and applying the concepts of math and data mining that I’m learning, I have to look EVERYTHING up. I’m on homework 3 and I have to look up how to do N factorial using a while loop and a for loop. I’m even struggling with bash….I’ve been told a lot of the practical application of this field is looking things up—and that not everyone remembers everything, its more about knowing where to look for your answer and simply knowing what your code is doing. Maybe it’s just my imposter syndrome kicking in but I feel like some of these things should be intuitive, like how will I fare in exams, interviews, etc.I’m even looking into internships for next summer and I feel like I’m not prepared at all to even apply",

I also have 8 months of internship experience at a small company from school before.Here’s the situation:Option 1: Stay at my current full-time role•Permanent position.•Cons: The company culture is toxic, lots of overtime, and not the healthiest environment.•Pros: Full-time experience means my next job hunt will be easier. I’m planning to quit after about a year anyway.Option 2: Take an 8-month internship at a large, globally recognized tech company•Pros: Amazing brand name for my resume, structured learning environment, mentorship, and likely healthier culture. Could open doors for interviews at top tech companies.•Cons: Only 8 months, so I’d be back on the job market afterward. Since it’s an internship, I’d likely have to apply for junior-level roles again and we all know how the junior dev market is rn. Pay would be 20–25% less than my current full-time role. No guarantee of full-time conversion.My dilemma:•Staying at the full-time role gives continuous experience and a higher paycheck, but the culture is toxic and might burn me out.•Taking the internship gives brand recognition and a healthier environment, but I’d earn less and likely have to apply for junior roles again after 8 months.I don’t care much about money right now at the moment, so the decision is more about career trajectory, learning, and next-job opportunities.",

I don't even remember which job he was taking about and when I asked him he shorlty said I am talking about IT job. He asked me what roll are you looking for. I still had no idea which job so I said random things and then eventually I realised I am talking BS so I said I really am sorry if this doesn't answer your question because I am not sure which job this is. He asked me, what do you wanna work with \"IT customer service or programming\". I said both are something I love. I don't mind working with both roles but I am always open for programming because I wanna grow in that field but customer service is also part of my retail job I enjoyed while working so to me combining them is great and I open for any role. He said we are not looking for programmers, we want IT customer service but I will write your name down and get back to you as soon as we need programmers. This whole concersation was filled with uncertainity and stutters so I was like ok thanks for reaching out.I didn't express myself as good as I wanted to. I am so mad I fked up the closest thing I came to getting hired. What mistakes did I make? I mean how can I keep track of the jobs I search when I am searching for jobs full time applying to at least 3 a day. I am literally open to everything because people told me that I cannot be picky (Im not applying to fields I have no experience/ knowledge in even in CS btw) about my first job.
