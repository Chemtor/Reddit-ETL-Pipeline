I do know SQL and Python but I was open about my lack of ability in using our database modeling too and other DE tools. I had a few KT sessions with the engineer which went well, and everything seemed straightforward.Cut to today:I noticed that our database modeling tool had things listed as materializing as views, when they were actually tables in BigQuery. Since they all had 'staging' labels, I thought I'd just correct that. I created a backup, asked ChatGPT if I was correct (which may have been an anti-safety step looking back, but I'm not a DE needed confirmation from somewhere), and since it was after office hours, I simply dropped all those tables. Not 30 seconds later and I receive calls from upper management, every dashboard just shutdown. The underlying data was all there, but all connections flatlined. I check, everything really is down. I still don't know why. In a moment of panic I restore my backup, and then rerun everything from our modeling tool, then reran our cloud scheduler. In about 20 minutes, everything was back. I suspect that this move was likely quite expensive, but I just needed everything to be back to normal ASAP.I don't know what to think from here. How do I check that everything is running okay? I don't know if they'll give me an earful tomorrow or if I should explain what happened or just try to cover up and call it a technical hiccup. I'm honestly quite overwhelmed by my own incompetenceEDIT more backstoryI am a bit more competent in BigQuery (before today, I'd call myself competent) and actually created a BigQuery ETL pipeline, which the last guy replicated into our actual modeling tool as his last task. But it wasn't quite right, so I not only had to disable the pipeline I made, but I also had to re-engineer what he tried doing as a replication. Despite my changes in the model, nothing seemed to take effect in the BigQuery. After digging into it, I realized the issue: the modeling tool treated certain transformations as views, but in BigQuery, they were actually tables. Since views can't overwrite tables, any changes I made silently failed.To prevent this kind of conflict from happening again, I decided to run a test to identify any mismatches between how objects are defined in BigQuery vs. in the modeling tool, fix those now rather than dealing with them later. Then the above happened",

I worry that going \"all in\" on SQL might limit my growth or pigeonhole me into a narrower role over time.I feel like this would push me away from core software engineering practices, given that SQL lacks features like OOP, unit testing, etc...Is Snowflake/Dbt still seen as a strong direction for data engineering, or would it be a step sideways/backwards compared to staying in the Spark ecosystem?Appreciate any insights!",

It's costing our business $10,000 per year. Granted that comes with theoretical support and maintenance. I'd estimate the vendor spends maybe 1-6 hours per year doing support. They don't know what value the company derives from it so they ask me every year about it. It does generate more value than it costs.I'm just wondering if this is even reasonable? We have over a hundred various systems that we need to incorporate as topics into the \"warehouse\" this IT team purchased from another vendor (it's highly immutable so really any ETL is just filling other databases in the same server). They did this stuff in like 2021-2022 and have yet to extend further, including building pipelines for the other sources. At this rate, we'll be paying millions of dollars to manage the full suite (plus whatever custom build charges hit upfront) of ETL, no even compute or storage. The $10k isn't for cloud, it's all on prem on our computer and storage.There's probably implementation details I'm leaving out. Just wondering if this is reasonable.",

My colleagues implemented a pattern where:* Each service writes individual records directly to Iceberg tables via Iceberg python client (pyiceberg)* Or a solution where we leverage S3 for decoupling, where: * Every single S3 event triggers a Lambda that appends **one record** to Iceberg * They envision eventually using Iceberg for everything - both operational and analytical workloads**Their Vision:*** \"Why maintain multiple data stores? Just use Iceberg for everything\"* \"Services can write directly without complex pipelines\"* \"AWS S3 Tables handle file optimization automatically\"* \"Each team manages their own schemas and tables\"**What We're Seeing in Production:**We're currently handling hundreds of events per minute across all services. We put the S3 -> Lambda -> append individual record via pyiceberg to the iceberg table solution. What I see is lot of those concurrency errors: CommitFailedException: Requirement failed: branch main has changed: expected id xxxxyx != xxxxxkkMultiple Lambdas are trying to commit to the same table simultaneously and failing.**My Position**I originally proposed:* Using PostgreSQL for operational/transactional data* Periodically ingesting PostgreSQL data into Iceberg for analytics* Micro-Batching records for streaming dataMy reasoning:* Iceberg uses optimistic concurrency control - only one writer can commit at a time per table* We're creating hundreds of tiny files instead of fewer, optimally-sized files* Iceberg is designed for \"large, slow-changing collections of files\" (per their docs)* The metadata overhead of tracking millions of small files will become expensive (regardless of the fact that this is abstracted away from use by using managed S3 Tables)**The Core Disagreement:** My colleagues believe S3 Tables' automatic optimizations mean we don't need to worry about file sizes or commit patterns. They see my proposed architecture (Postgres + batch/micro-batch ingestion, i.e. using Firehose/Spark structured streaming) as unnecessary complexity.It feels we're trying to use Iceberg as both an OLTP and OLAP system when it's designed for OLAP.**Questions for the Community:**1. Has anyone successfully used Iceberg as their primary datastore for both operational AND analytical workloads?2. Is writing individual records to Iceberg (hundreds per minute) sustainable at scale?3. Do S3 Tables' optimizations actually solve the small files and concurrency issues?4. Am I overcomplicating by suggesting separate operational/analytical stores?Looking for real-world experiences, not theoretical debates. What actually works in production?Thanks!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I wanted to start a conversation about the growing expectation for data professionals to become more \"full-stack.\" Especially in the Brazilian market, I've noticed a trend, or even a pressure, for people to take on more responsibilities across the entire data workflow, sometimes beyond their original role.I’ve been working as a Data Engineer for a little over a year now, focusing mainly on EL processes, building data pipelines and delivering datasets to the primary layer. From there, Analytics Engineers usually take over and apply transformations. I hold certifications in Airflow (Astronomer) and Databricks Data Engineer Fundamentals, and I’m currently thinking about diving into DBT, mainly through personal projects.Recently, I received the suggestion that being full-stack in data is the ideal, or even necessary, path to follow. That got me thinking:How far should we go in expanding our technical scope? Are we sacrificing depth for breadth? Is this expectation more common for Data Engineers than for AEs or Data Scientists? Is being full-stack really an advantage in the long run, or just a sign of immaturity or lack of process in some organizations?I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who have faced this kind of situation or work in more structured data teams.",

        "content": "Been thinking a lot about how broken access to computing has become in AI.We’ve reached a point where training and inference demand insane GPU power, but almost everything is gated behind AWS, GCP, and Azure. If you’re a startup, indie dev, or research lab, good luck affording it. Even if you can, there’s the compliance overhead, opaque usage policies, and the quiet reality that all your data and models sit in someone else’s walled garden.This centralization creates 3 big issues:* Cost barriers lock out innovation* Surveillance and compliance risks go up* Local/grassroots AI development gets stifledI came across a project recently, Ocean Nodes, that proposes a decentralized alternative. The idea is to create a permissionless compute layer where anyone can contribute idle GPUs or CPUs. Developers can run containerized workloads (training, inference, validation), and everything is cryptographically verified. It’s essentially DePIN combined with AI workloads.Not saying it solves everything overnight, but it flips the model: instead of a few hyperscalers owning all the compute, we can build a network where anyone contributes and anyone can access. Trust is built in by design, not by paperwork.Has anyone here tried running AI jobs on decentralized infrastructure or looked into Ocean Nodes? Does this kind of model actually have legs for serious ML workloads? Would love to hear thoughts.",

And dbt Python models are only available for some cloud database services while we use Postgres on-prem, so no go here.Now finally for the question: can you point me to software/frameworks that- allow Python code execution- build a DAG like dbt and only execute what is required- offer versioning where you could „go back in time“ to obtain the state of data like it was half a year before- offer a graphical view of the DAG- offer data lineage - help with project structure and are not overly complicated It should be open source software, no GUI required.

Of course we are just getting started, so one might suggest choosing a barebone DB and some basic tools to launch the app, but anticipating traffic, we want to distill the best knowledge available out there and choose the best stack to build our product from the beginning.For our chat application, where all typical user behaviors are there - messages, spaces, \"last seen\" or \"active\" statuses, message notifications, read receipts, etc. we need to choose a database to store all our chats. We also want to enable chat searches, and since search will inevitably lead to random chats, we want that perf to be consistently excellent.We are planning to use Django (with channels) as our backend. What database is recommended to use with Django to persist the messages? I read that Discord used to use Cassandra, but then it started acting up due to garbage collection, so they switched rto Scylla, and they are very happy with trillions of messages on it. Is ScyllDB a good candidate for our purpose to use with Django? Do these two work together well? Can MongoDB do it (my preferred choice, but I read that it starts acting up with high number of reads or writes at the same time - which would be a basic use case for enterprise chat scenario)?",

        "content": "This is not just another post about 'how to transition into Data Engineering'. I want to share a real challenge I’ve been facing, despite being actively learning, practicing, and building projects. Yet, breaking into a DE role has proven harder than I expected.I have around 6 years of experience working as a data analyst, mostly focused on advanced SQL, data modeling, and reporting with Tableau. I even led a short-term ETL project using Tableau Prep, and over the past couple of years, my work has been very close to what an Analytics Engineer does—building robust queries over a data warehouse, transforming data for self-service reporting, and creating scalable models.Along this journey, I’ve been deeply investing in myself. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Engineering course that’s constantly updated with modern tools, techniques, and cloud workflows. I’ve also built several open-source projects where I apply DE concepts in practice: Python-based pipelines, Docker orchestration, data transformations, and automated workflows.I tend to avoid saying 'I have no experience' because, while I don’t have formal production experience in cloud environments, I do have hands-on experience through personal projects, structured learning, and working with comparable on-prem or SQL-based tools in my previous roles. However, the hiring process doesn’t seem to value that in the same way.The real obstacle comes down to the production cloud experience. Almost every DE job requires AWS, Databricks, Spark, etc.—but not just knowledge, production-level experience. Setting up cloud projects on my own helps me learn, but comes with its own headaches: managing resources carefully to avoid unexpected costs, configuring environments properly, and the limitations of working without a real production load.I’ve tried the 'get in as a Data Analyst and pivot internally' strategy a few times, but it hasn’t worked for me.At this point, it feels like a frustrating loop: companies want production experience, but getting that experience without the job is almost impossible. Despite the learning, the practice, and the commitment, the outcome hasn't been what I hoped for.So my question is—how do people actually break this loop? Is there something I’m not seeing? Or is it simply about being patient until the right opportunity shows up? I’m genuinely curious to hear from those who’ve been through this or from people on the hiring side of things.",

        "content": "**TL;DR:** Open source \"dbt for API integration\" - SQL-centric, git-friendly, no vendor lock-in. Code-first approach to API workflows.Hey r/dataengineering,We built Sequor to solve a recurring problem: choosing between two bad options for API/app integration:1. Proprietary black-box SaaS connectors with vendor lock-in2. Custom scripts that are brittle, opaque, and hard to maintainAs data engineers, we wanted a solution that followed the principles that made dbt so powerful (code-first, git-based version control, SQL-centric), but designed specifically for API integration workflows.**What Sequor does:*** Connects APIs to your databases with an iterator model* Uses SQL for all data transformations and preparation* Defines workflows in YAML with proper version control* Adds procedural flow control (if-then-else, for-each loops)* Uses Python and Jinja for dynamic parameters and response mapping**Quick example:** * Data acquisition: Pull Salesforce leads → transform with SQL → push to HubSpot → all in one declarative pipeline.* Data activation (Reverse ETL): Pull customer behavior from warehouse → segment with SQL → sync personalized offers to Klaviyo/Mailchimp* App integration: Pull new orders from Amazon → join with SQL to identify new customers → create the customers and sales orders in NetSuite* App integration: Pull inventory levels from NetSuite → filter with SQL for eBay-active SKUs → update quantities on eBay**How it's different from other tools:**Instead of choosing between rigid and incomplete prebuilt integration systems, you can easily build your own custom connectors in minutes using just two basic operations (**transform** for SQL and **http\\_request** for APIs) and starting from prebuilt examples we provide.The project is open source and we welcome any feedback and contributions.**Links:*** Website: [https://sequor.dev/](https://sequor.dev/) (includes code examples)* Quickstart: [https://docs.sequor.dev/getting-started/quickstart](https://docs.sequor.dev/getting-started/quickstart)* GitHub: [https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor](https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor)* Examples of prebuilt integrations: [https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor-integrations](https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor-integrations)**Questions for the community:*** What's your current approach to API integrations?* What business apps and integration scenarios do you struggle with most?* Are there specific workflows that have been particularly challenging to implement?",

Our company has some pipelines that take data from Salesforce tables and loads it in to Snowflake. Very simple example, Table A from salesforce into Table A snowflake. I would think that it would be very simple just to run an overnight job of truncating table A in snowflake -> load data from table A salesforce and then we would have an accurate copy in snowflake (obviously minus any changes made in salesforce after the overnight job). Ive recently discovered that the team managing this process takes only \"changes\" in salesforce (I think this is called change data capture..?), using the salesforce record's last modified date to determine whether we need to load/update data in salesforce. I have discovered some pretty glaring data quality issues in snowflakes copy.. and it makes me ask the question... why cant we just run a job like i've described in the paragraph above? Is it to mitigate the amount of data movement? We really don't have that much data even.",

My work involves interviewing and selecting the interns, designing and implementing the program’s learning plan, mentoring/teaching interns among some other bureaucratic stuff.I’ve been working on the program for 3+ years, and it’s at a stage where we have some standard processes that streamline our work (like a standard learning plan that we evolve based on the feedback from each internship class, results and the observations from the team, and a well-defined selection process, which we also evolve based on similar parameters). Since I’ve been doing this for a while, I also have a kind of standard approach, which I obviously adapt to the context of each cohort and the specificities and needs of the intern I’m managing. This system works well the way it is, but there’s always room for improvement.

We’ve successfully flattened the arrays into a tabular model, but the resulting tables are huge — both in terms of columns and rows — and we can’t run dbt models efficiently on top of them.We attempted to create intermediate, smaller tables in BigQuery to reduce complexity before loading into AWS, but this introduced an extra transformation layer that we’d rather avoid, as it complicates the pipeline and maintainability.I’d like to implement an incremental model in dbt, but I’m not sure if that’s going to be effective given the way the GA4 data is structured and the performance bottlenecks we’ve hit so far.Has anyone here faced similar challenges with integrating GA4 data into an AWS ecosystem?How did you handle the schema explosion and performance issues with dbt/Redshift?Any thoughts on best practices or architecture patterns would be really appreciated.Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "I am relatively new to the world of data lake houses. I'm looking for some thoughts or guidance. In a solution that must be on prem, I have data arriving from multiple sources (files and databases) at the bronze layer. Now in order to get from bronze to silver and then gold, I need some rules based transformation. These rules are not available in a source system today, so the requirement is to create an editable dataset within the lakehouse. This isn't data that's bronze or will be transformed. Business also needs an UI to set these rules. While iceberg does have data editing capabilities, I'm somewhat convinced it's better to have another custom application take care of the rules definition and storage, and be a source of the rules data, instead of managing it all with iceberg and a query engine. To me, it sounds like management of rules is an OLTP use case. Till we decide on this, we are letting the rules be in a file, and that file acts as a source of data brought into the lakehouse. Does anyone else do this? Maintain some master data set that's only in the data lakehouse? Should lakehouses only have a copy of data sourced from somewhere, or can they be a store of completely new datasets created directly in the lake?",

I have a Python project that pulls dog listings from one of my local animal shelters daily, cleans the data, and then writes to an Azure PostgreSQL database. I also wrote some APIs for the db to pull schema data, active/recently retired listings, etc. I'm at an impasse with what to do next. I am considering three paths:1. Build a frontend and containerize. Frontend would consist of a Django/Flask interface that shows active dog listings and/or links to a Tableau dashboard that displays data on old listings of dogs who have since left the shelter.2. Refactor my code with PySpark. Right now I'm storing data in basic Pandas dataframes so that I can clean them and push them to a single Azure PostgreSQL node. It's a fairly small animal shelter, so I'm only handling up to 80-100 records a day, but refactoring would at least prove Spark skills.3. Scale up and include more shelters (would probably follow #2). Right now, I'm only pulling from a single shelter that only has up to ~100 dogs at a time. I could try to scale up and include listings from all animal shelters within a certain distance from me. Only potential downside is increase in cloud budget if I have to set up multiple servers for cloud computing/db storage.Which of these paths should I prioritize for?

Query the output, see what's missing, then process that. Seems simple, but has scalability limitations because you need to list the entire history. Would need to query both GCS and BQ to compare what files are still missing.2. Have some external system or work queue that keeps track of incomplete work. Scales better, but has the potential to go out of sync with reality (e.g. if Extract fails to write to the work queue, the file is never transformed or loaded).I suppose this is a common problem that everyone has solved already. What are the best practices around this? Is there any (ideally FOSS) tooling that could help me?",

        "author": "Original_Chipmunk941",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Question:**I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform for data engineering. I learned that there are three types of schemas that I can use when constructing tables in BigQuery: 1) Normalized relational schema, 2) Nested & Repeating Schema, 3) Denormalized schema. I am trying to understand when I will realistically use \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" instead of \"normalized relational schema\" for the tables that I construct in BigQuery.Please answer both of these questions below:1. When do you use \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" over \"normalized relational schema\" when you construct tables in BigQuery?2. When constructing tables within BigQuery data warehouses, how often do you use \"Nested & Repeating Schema\"? How often do you use \"normalized relational schema\"? If possible, please provide me a ballpark percentage (Ex. 40% Nested & Repeating Schema vs. 60% normalized relational schema). **My Current Rationale:**I understand that BigQuery is a columnar oriented database. I learned that \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" is a more cost-effective for querying and more efficient than \"normalized relational schema\". However, even after researching it, I do not fully understand the real life advantages of \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" over a \"normalized relational schema\".Although \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" is more efficient and cost-effective for querying, I think a \"normalized relational schema\" makes more sense because it allows you to update records more easily like a traditional SQL RDBMS.I understand that columnar oriented databases are great when your historical data within the BigQuery table does not change. However, from my experience on working as a data analyst, historical data frequently needs to change. For example, lets say you have an external OLTP RDBMS that feeds into BigQuery daily. This external OLTP RDBMS contains a table named sales data. This table contains a column named \"Member Status\" and returns either one of two outputs: \"Active\" or \"Inactive\". \"Member ID\" 123456 has a \"Member Status\" of \"Active\". The data for that daily load is sent from the external OLTP RDBMS to the BigQuery table containing the data of \"Member ID\" 123456 with a \"Member Status\" of \"Active\". Three months later, the \"Member Status\" of \"Member ID\" 123456 changes to \"Inactive\" within the external OLTP RDBMS.From my understanding, now I cannot change that data easily within the BigQuery table if it has \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" . If my BigQuery table had \"normalized relational schema\", it should be able to update the \"Member Status\" of \"Member ID\" 123456 very easily.This is my rationale on why I think a \"normalized relational schema\" is better than \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" for the majority of real world use cases. Please let me know if you agree, disagree, etc. I would love to hear your thoughts. I am still learning GCP and data engineering. Thank you for reading. :)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I wanted to ask if you have any rules for when you'd use SQL first and when you build tooling and fuller suites in PySpark.My company intend to copy some data from a very small (relatively) Oracle database to AWS. This won't be the entire DB copied, it will be just some of the data we want to use for analytical purposes (non-live, non-streaming, just weekly or monthly reporting). Therefore, it does not have to be migrated using RDS or into Redshift. The architects planned to dump some of the data into S3 buckets and then our DE team will take it from there. We have some SQL code written by a previous DE to query the on-prem DB and create views and new tables. My question is: I would prefer no-SQL if I could choose. My instinct would be to write the new code within AWS in PySpark and make it more structured, implement unit testing etc., and move away from SQL. Some team members, however, say the easiest thing is to use the SQL code we have to create the views which the analytics team are used to faster within AWS and why reinvent the wheel. But I feel like this new service is a good opportunity to improve the codebase and move away from SQL which I see as limiting.What would be your approach to this situation? Do you have a general rule for when SQL would be preferable and when you'd use PySpark?Thanks in advance for your advice and input!",

However, I feel like it's a real struggle to maintain: - I couldn't manage to have it run behind an nginx so far (SNI issues) in the docker-compose context - I find documentation to be really thin - Interface can be confusing, naming of processors also - Not that many tutorials/walkthrough, and many stackoverflow answers aren't I wanted to try it in order to replace old scripts and avoid technical debt, but I am feeling like NiFi might not be super easy to maintain.I am wondering if keeping digging into Nifi is worth the pain, if managing the flows can be easy to integrate on the long run or if Nifi is definitely made for bigger teams with strong processes?Maybe we should stick to Airflow as it has more support and is more widespread?Also, any feedback on NifiKop in order to run it in kubernetes?I am also up for any suggestion!Thank you very much!",

It discusses the way we hide our work, our questions, and our projects until one day we just showcase something amazing that built, first try, no errors, ya know because we're geniuses.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ) The talk was hosted by Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman, in which they give this introductory description of the talk:\"A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development: everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius. In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.\"One part that resonated with me greatly was regarding the human developer. \"I will toil in this cave and no one will know this code exists until it is perfect, at which point I will emerge and be recognized for the genius I am.\" On reddit, have you ever done some quick research before clicking that \"post\" button, out of concern you may be wrong or fearful of backlash? Same concept.The consequence of this (among others) is that neither your team nor the newer generation of programmers will get to see all of the failure you had to endure, to achieve that one cool thing, because of the way we want to be viewed. Enduring those failures and overcoming them, I believe, is more important then, and required by, any programming language, framework, tool, etc.Newcomers have all the resources, AI, and work previous generations have accomplished to look up to but we are doing those people a disservice by hiding our failures due to human emotion wether thats how we want to be viewed or general fear of negative feedback from our work.Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone or become divisive, it's just some unspoken honesty that I have appreciation for and it stuck with me because honestly... it hit close to home when I saw it back then.",

        "content": "A little advice to developers who are starting out from a software architect with 15 years experience and a 2:1 Computer Science degree. Today was the first time I've ever seen Leetcode whilst I was watching a few YouTube videos about some updates to C# (My language of choice). For me, Leetcode is definitely not reflective at all of what you would do in the majority of programming jobs and is very algorithmically heavy. Most of these algorithms you will not need to know at all most of the time as most languages contain core libraries that do this stuff way more efficiently than most developers will be able to do. Case in point, I was stuck on the first question today for about 45 minutes mainly because the question was worded really badly. I managed to solve that pretty quickly after I understood what it was asking for although I will admit I did it in my IDE rather than in Leetcode as nobody codes in the equivalent of Notepad anymore (although that's how I started back in the day). The second question I was completely stumped and gave up because it was more maths than programming (and believe it or not, you do not need to be good at maths to be a good developer). It's really going to depend on what you end up doing as an actual job. If you are writing drivers or doing anything mathematically heavy in your job then yes Leetcode might be a good fit but mostly it's algorithmic nonsense that most developers will never even use. I've worked for some of the biggest banks, insurance providers doing APIs hooking up to some pretty complex business logic and never have I had to use anything close to Leetcode level solutions. My point is, don't be disappointed in yourself if you struggle with Leetcode. You can still be a success. Lead teams. Produce mobile applications and desktop systems that millions of users use and enjoy each year all without ever needing to worry about the types or problems shown on Leetcode.",

It won’t teach you much except perhaps mundane things like API interfaces etc.I could leave him learning C, which is sort-of fine. I wonder if he’d develop things more quickly in another language and that would increase his engagement.By the same token I think it’s pointless to teach him ARM assembly. It would be an awful lot of effort for limited output - learning lots of instructions and different register sets just so he could e.g. multiply two numbers together. Whereas I tended to use ARM assembly because I needed speed 30 years ago.What do people think? Thoughts welcome.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "In my 10 years so far with tech, I have had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some brilliantly talented and well educated programmers. However, I have seen those same developers have their arguments and perspectives fall flat, despite their technical prowess, while less technically gifted minds withhold tremendously valuable ideas for fear of being caught on a technicality or unknown detail.TL;DR - We are taught that cleanliness and efficiency of code is the earmark of a quality solution. While important, we fail to educate programmers on the importance of factors beyond the code and how to navigate the complexity and priorities of a real application. This post is for anyone who is truly curious about what \"good code\" really means, and for those who suspect the answer has more to do with the problems you solve than the language you use to do it.**Introduction**Goodhart's Law - \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\"I think most of us have experienced those often frustrating debates between programmers where one is claiming the other has an inferior approach because \"I could write it faster by doing x.\" or \"I could write it with less complexity by doing y.\"My goal with this post is to primarily open up discussion around this topic and hopefully provide something valuable from my 10 years of doing software development.Before I dig in, I think it's only fair to say where I come from. I have worked the last 10 years in cloud development, working with a lot of different SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS technologies. I have dabbled a LITTLE in hardware and lower level languages - but never really had to do much in terms of deploying code for a new piece of hardware and have, admittedly, been a bit spoiled on not having to deal with things like managing pointers or resolving memory errors at a lower level. However, what I want to talk about should be a fair bit removed from that level of granularity and speaks more to how we as programmers approach a problem. That being said, I have worked as an admin using declarative tools, managed code bases of several million lines, and successfully implemented several medium and large scale system architectures in my time. That is to say, I've seen a lot of shit in the last decade.**Conflating personal skills with solution quality**With the preface out of the way, let me put my assertion straight. I see a lot of programmers conflating their proficiency with coding (speed to write code, initial resilience of code, complexity mitigation, readability, testability, etc.) as a reflection of solution quality. It is a frequent and concerning problem that many programmers are taught or conclude that the quality of how the code is written is above the functionality of the existing application.For clarity, I am not saying that things like readability are irrelevant to the measurement of a solution's quality. Of course, all other things equal, a solution with more readable code is a better solution than the same with less readable code. What I am saying is that the actual influence of these metrics varies depending on the environment and context of the implemented solution.For example, a small scale and local utility (such as a simple script for managing files in a folder) does not gain nearly as much proportional benefit from more readable code as a large scale ETL job managed by multiple people from multiple teams working in multiple frameworks. We could deliberate endlessly on what the \"correct\" weighting of these metrics are for any given project, but the real issue is when these metrics become surrogates for the strategic goal of the application.The reality is that, when it comes down to the application running and doing its job, the only thing that matters is how well it does its job: How efficiently does it succeed when it is provided valid inputs, how effectively does it recover from unexpected inputs/results, and how safely does it fail in the event of an unrecoverable error?Nobody cares that you made it super readable if it doesn't work. Nobody cares that you wrote it faster if it's laden with bugs. No one is happy that you reduced 30 lines to 2 lines if it makes the application a total resource hog. Similarly, nobody cares if it runs 500ms faster UNLESS that 500ms makes a difference in the grand scheme of the tech.Simply put, there is an important and clear distinction between your skills as a programmer, and the quality of the solution you produce. While your technical skills as a programmer are EXTREMELY important, they do not necessarily ensure that the solutions you produce are quality solutions. It's a mistake I have seen a lot of developers make, and it leaves them bewildered because they felt they did everything right. It reminds me of the classic Indiana Jones scene when Jones simply shoots the guy showing off all his fancy moves. It looks cool, super impressive, but totally useless in the wrong context.**Programming and solution quality is impacted by the real world and supporting relationships.**\"I would've never written it this way. They could've easily done x to make this better.\"We've all felt that way at least once. You are SO blessed to finally work on that bit of code that hasn't been touched in 25 years just to find it is such a convoluted mess of outdated checks, redundant assignments, tightly coupled classes, et al. The feat of the developers goes from \"This is really nice and sensible code that I can work with.\" to \"How the hell did the last guy keep this thing running at all?\"This sentiment that you would've done it better by doing it your way is almost always a lie you're telling yourself. Here's why:Programming, as we all hopefully understand by now, is an iterative process. That means to reach your ideal state, you necessarily cannot jump from step 0 to the final step. There are checkpoints you must cross in order to get there. However, these checkpoints are marked by the application's functionality, and the structure/ease of the code is loosely implied by the business/client at best.In other words, the developer will always be pressured to produce functional code over \"clean\" code. I am not referring to the actual principles of Clean Code necessarily, just whatever your idea of the \"right way to write the code\" is.This means that leading into these checkpoints, there are always unanswered questions and missing pieces of context that we wish we would have had in the beginning. I just recently was working on a report generation tool for a friend when, just a week before we needed it to be done, they decided to clarify that certain parts of the report needed to have dynamic labeling and columns when we had already understood them as static elements. As you can imagine, that's a totally different approach than I had originally planned for. With not enough time to totally rewrite the program, I had a choice:1. Quickly refactor the code, accept that it'll be a bit messy, defer proper restructuring, happy client because it works.2. Ask for an extension to the deadline, customer misses their reporting window, blame them for not being clear and not knowing that information at the beginning?I, of course, asked for the extension. They, of course, denied the request. So, I went with option 1. Why? Because the relationship was more valuable to me than the structure of my code. I will absolutely take on a bit of a messier solution on the backend to secure another future project and ensure the client is happy **in this scenario**.That's not to say it's always the right answer. I have refused to deploy changes that were of security or regulatory concern because not going to jail was more important than winning another project. I'm not even saying I am always right in which options I take for these situations. My point, as highlighted by the title of this section, is that the world around the application matters a LOT. Assuming you would have done it better without knowing all of the context for why those decisions were made is not only unfair to the previous developers, but is simply a conclusion driven by ego.Tying this back to our main theme, you are measuring the quality of the solution based on metrics which are not the goal. The goal was a functional app that satisfied the defined requirements within the allotted timeline. That's it.**Programmers have limitations. It's okay to not be a superhuman.**I'm going to pivot the focus a bit and talk more about you - the programmer. I'm not going to say that every programmer is an antisocial basement dweller who would never suffer the presence of another human being or (God-forbid) a team building exercise. We know that already (jk).Seriously, though, there are some INCREDIBLE programmers out there. I've seen people who have mastered a multitude of frameworks, seem to 100x processing times every time they touch something, and can build a decent MVP, if given all the info up front, at a break-neck pace.But, I have also seen programmers who are incredible in a different way. They may be slower on the keyboard, but they do a much better job at diagnosing issues and getting to the root cause of a problem. Some of them are incredible at interpersonal relationship building (very valuable in tech as a programmer, just saying). Some can understand a seemingly limitless amount of complexity and boil things down to a simple direction that everyone understands. I've met and managed a few that seemed to be able to do all of it and more entirely on their own (usually 25+ YoE on those guys/gals).We say this all the time, but I think we forget to take our own advice: Programming is so much more than the code. For every rockstar programmer I have had the pleasure of working with, I could identify several issues working with them. Even the guy who does it all tends to be a victim of their own success and struggles to not dominate the room when collaboration is a must. Everyone has their gaps in knowledge and that's okay. Programming is an absurdly broad, dense, and deep discipline.I say this, because I still see it as a big issue in tech today. I think AI has really inflamed the issue too (I won't be getting into that) because of how many different ways there are to use this, frankly, very powerful tool. Please, for the sake of your sanity and enjoyment of programming, do not measure yourself OR OTHERS on a single dimension. It is my belief that a pillar of a good programmer is the ability to appreciate solutions and strengths which they do not possess nor understand, and the ability to keep the big picture in mind when addressing a potential weakness in themselves, the solution, or another programmer. Remember, comparison is the thief of joy.**What leads to the surrogation of goals in software?**I think it takes a lot of tolerance for uncertainty to work in tech. After all, your job is to essentially invent things that don't exist yet. Sure, there's a million pdf parsers out there, but there isn't one that does EXACTLY what you need the EXACT way you need it. There are 1000s of security camera models out there, but your new camera design (hopefully) taps into something the market is being starved of.But, what the hell do you do when something like blockchain hits it big? What if you're required to use a library you've never even heard of? What if Maggie in accounting can't so much as find the damn Windows start button, yet she's the VP of your project and wants to know every little technical detail just to ridicule things she doesn't understand? Dammit Maggie, it's a REST call! IT'S JUST A....On top of that, we hardly have much consensus on what \"good code\" even is - or the \"right\" way to do it. We had waterfall for some 30 years, then Agile happened, but we still have waterfall and now we have hybrid Waterfall/Agile teams with varying adherence to either paradigm. Sometimes they just make up their own rules and call it Agile because they do stuff on a bi-weekly cadence.Plus, you have Scrum and Kanban muddying the waters. But, you also have standards like TOGAF and ITIL. Let's also not forget how SaaS providers like Jira have their own rules to abide by. Honorable mention to the books and onslaught of professionals saying \"I have figured it out! Buy my shit.\" That's all before you even get to the framework you're going to be working in. It's a freaking mess!The reality is, we just don't know what perfect code is. We can generally approximate when code is written poorly or well, and we can loosely articulate the reasons and speculations around that approximation, but we don't \\*know\\* if it's right except for very specific cases (of which there are still many examples). Nearly everything is up to debate, and it can be really hard to be certain that the code we write is good. Except, it doesn't need to be.**Preventing surrogation of goals.**Ironically, one of the most important lessons I have learned in tech has been from the least technical users I have encountered. I learned that there are two questions that should always be guiding a solution.1. Why does this work?2. Why doesn't this work?If you're underwhelmed, you probably should be. If you're enraged because of questions like -1. What about the code structure and efficiency?2. What about security?3. How does this help me implement design patterns into my work?\\- bear with me.As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I have seen many programmers prioritize the quality of the code over the functionality of the app. I've seen it in practice as well as in conversations/debates amongst programmers. These questions still matter, but their relevance is predicated on how it answers the question of \"Why does this work,\" and/or \"Why doesn't this work?\"What about structure and efficiency? Is that why it does/doesn't work? If the current code structure does not significantly impact the solutions ability to work or not work, then it's a moot question. It's moot, because it has no meaningful bearings on how well the app does its job (or fails to do its job).For a personal utility script where the focus is on development efficiency and functionality, not raw execution speed, a few seconds' difference in runtime is inconsequential. So the practical value of a faster script is diminished if it sacrifices development efficiency. Ultimately, **the script's success is defined by whether or not it works as intended.** In that regard, a 'slower' script developed in one hour can be a more pragmatic solution than a 'faster' one that took three hours to build.Now, I said a lot about strengths and weaknesses of a programmer. So let's take it a step further and address the speed at which coding is done. I, frankly, am not a super fast coder. I'm not the slowest in the room, but I was never the guy who could just churn code like a factory (pattern).I know, way to show my ass to the crowd. The thing is, I am simply stronger in analysis and communication than I am in writing code. I'm cool with being that guy. I love working with developers who are code factories and don't want to deal with people as much, because that's a complementary counterpart to what I bring to the table. So, while I focus on drafting demos and POCs and diagrams and all of these things about the application, they can focus on the real meat of the application, preventing backdoors, scaling efficiency, obscure mathematical theorems, etc.However, since we are talking about a collaborative environment, it is important to note that this is not a siloed effort. I NEED to write production code because I NEED to understand what goes into it, pitfalls, and tricks. I may be subordinate to the code master next to me, but I cannot circumvent the necessity of actually doing the work. The same goes for the code master. They NEED to create diagrams and explain concepts because they NEED to understand how the customer feels, whether or not their idea can conceptually make sense to another person, and so on. Just like they bail me out if I back myself into a corner, I bail them out if they start fumbling the presentation. It goes both ways, and we both become exceptional for it.**The True Programmer, and respecting your colleagues**I know advocating for respect on an internet forum is a quintessential example of \"screaming into the void,\" but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.Just like how I said we don't know a lot of things, we (as a society) don't know what a true programmer is. Something to do with writing code, something to do with building applications. I'm not here to claim that I have the be-all-end-all answer to what a true programmer is. Quite the opposite.The literal definition of a programmer is pretty vague when you look at it from a technical perspective. There's a lot of nuance and layers to writing a computer program that we could spend a long time deliberating over. That is precisely why we must be very careful, or downright avoid, the argument that \"someone who does x\" or \"someone who doesn't know y\" is or is not a \"true programmer.\" Fans of the True-Scotsman fallacy will know exactly what I mean here. It's an argument that leads to nowhere.The reality is technology is a part of everyone's life, and everyone's perspective on it matters. We need non-technical users to break our apps and force us to come up with more resilient and intuitive designs. We need semi-technical users to help translate the real world to technical ideas with new and creative inspirations outside of the conventional walls. We need deeply technical users to navigate the gritty details of building the applications when they're 9 layers removed from the original problem. Most importantly, we need all of them to work together to build anything meaningful.Everyone gets into tech with their own perspective for their own reasons. But what technology is, fundamentally, doesn't change. Whether it's writing a new business integration or starting a SaaS company or building robots or even developing new devices that don't require a plug - the whole idea of technology is rooted in discovery. We take the chaos the world presents us, and learn how to contain it and use it to achieve our goals. Fire became torches, circuits became software, and Maggie became a great lesson for me in what really matters in software.I hope this post serves as a valuable reminder of all the things we still don't know in software and technology as a whole. I hope it reassures newcomers that it's okay to feel like everything is a hot mess - because it is. I also hope it helps to soothe some of the hardened veterans who know things and learned lessons that the vast majority of society could hardly understand, let alone be expected to know. Finally, I hope it helps everyone make better applications by focusing on what really matters. Whether it's an actual project, or just discussing ideas with a stranger, we should always focus on why it does or doesn't work first, and remember that what is most valuable to us as programmers is not always what's most valuable to the applications themselves.**P.S. Counter arguments and the importance of taking different approaches**I am acutely aware that there are many software that are vastly different than the cushy business applications I have come to know. Even banks have a higher tolerance of failure than, say, the technology responsible for safely landing your aircraft. Furthermore, there is a very real snowball effect poorly written code has where tech debt and developer morale go in the wrong directions quickly.This is not me advocating for haphazardly writing code and being complacent with what we do not know. If you've got 30 layers of if statements in your method, I'm inclined to believe that you did something wrong and should have fixed it a long time ago. Getting the job done tomorrow matters as well as getting it done today, usually. You'll never solve for everything, so you always try to solve what matters the most first, and there are times that your application can \"get the job done\" today, but should absolutely not see the light of production until it is completely reworked into a sensible architecture.The answer to \"Why doesn't this work?\" can very likely be \"Because it's so impossible to understand that we won't know why it fails.\" or \"Because this bug introduces a 0.1% chance that the plane slams into the ground upside down and kills everyone on board.\"This is a bit more philosophical, but I am of the mind that you should always have unresolved reasons for why something doesn't work. If you don't, you probably don't know your application very well. This ultimately gets into risk assessment and whether or not the risk/reward is worth it. A tiny risk of a minor issue, like a script running a few seconds slow, may not be worth hours of work. However, a tiny risk of a major disaster, like a plane crash, is unacceptable and must be addressed. Deciding what risks to tackle is a judgment call based on the severity of the potential outcome.Remember, the definition of what does and does not work varies. You need to be aware of it and set your own standards (at least, as much as you're able to) to ensure that the software you produce is to the quality it needs to be. Knowing the implications of not following a best practice, and accurately determining if it's a meaningful risk, is an extremely delicate decision. You need to know the rules and respect the rules before you go off deciding to intentionally break them.",

He said he would be interested in doing it, however I was relaying the information to some people and they’ve said that programming is dead now because of AI and a lot of people are not able to make use of their skills anymore. They said that it’s not worth it to learn how to code. I’m really conflicted because I would like my brother to learn skills early on that will help him in his later schooling and career and he isn’t struggling to grasp basic concepts in college like I was. I still want to enroll him in scratch course because I know in the end he will learn something and it’s worth it rather than him not doing anything at all. I wanted to know if anyone had any advice on how I can help him learn early on about the IT industry, software engineering, etc. so he already has basic knowledge beforehand. Any courses, classes, activities for middle schoolers? I know about code ninjas but I’m not a fan of those learning center franchises.

        "content": "So basically, I'm studying first year of CS, we're at the end of the year and we learnt about the basics of c++, using simple data structures like maps, or binary trees, or lists, pointers , and classes. As a part of a final project we have been tasked to create a Finder class that accepts pointers to any type of object. It assumes the object has a get rectangle function that gives it's left, right, top and bottom coordinates. It must be able to add, erase, and update the positions.The last function must return a set that contains the pointers to the objects that are inside or intersect with a given rectangle. and the problem is we have to do it in O(log n) with n being the number of rectangles on the container.In my research I've found that to accomplish this I've gotta use complex (at least for me) data structures like rtrees or quadtrees, which doesn't seem very reasonable to me. And we haven't been given any more guidelines how or what we can and cannot do. Do you guys think I should investigate and implement one of these tree structures? Or is there a simpler alternative?Thanks in advance to everyone.Update: I wasn't expecting this many responses, wow. So I took your advice and spent the whole day learning and implementing this quad tree fucker because I had to deliver it for today, it works and all the automatic test give the ok. And within the two weeks we had to do this I started to do it yesterday because I'm too lazy.I asked my friend and it seems most people have implemented a grid system with maps, but the tree seems to be better and more elegant I learnt a lot today so, again, thanks.",

Eventually I decided I wanted to make a discord bot, and decided to try JavaScript, since ive gotten pretty okay with Python, and ive gotten okay with JavaScript, but here is my problem.I have an issue where I constantly run into ideas for some small and some large things I want to work on. My newest idea is an app for taking notes, so I can organize all of my ideas.I am fully aware that apps like that exist, but the problem is, none of them organize how I want them to, I have very specific ideas, and all of them have adds or require premium purchases.I want to make my own app so I can have it how I want, and put it out for free, so others can also use it without ever adding adds or preventing anyone from being able to use it properly.Another idea was making a mod for SDV, but its a big idea, which requires me to learn C#, so all in all my question relates to the notes thing specifically. Which language would be best to program a notes taking app in? (Sorry for the very long and likely confusing explanation, I just wanted to explain everything properly.)",

This time, I received a good review, possibly even being considered for promotion. No more comments about being slow.However, just 3 months after that latest performance review (at 1 year and 9 months of experience — which is now), I received feedback again from others saying that I'm slow. These comments came from a few different sprints, and possibly from different people as well.For more context, the \"slowness\" now refers to me taking a longer time to complete relatively simple tasks. I was asked why I needed so much time to finish a task that others completed in much less time. (Even though the task was simple, I still completed it on time.) While working on it, I encountered some hiccups — which were simple to fix — but it still took me some time to figure out the solutions. This might be because the issues were new to me, I quickly got the grasp of where are going wrong, but finding the workable fix take me sometime, or maybe because I'm just not good enough at logic or programming, which makes me slower than others.What can I do now?I'm starting to question myself about pursuing a career in programming. Does all of this mean I’m just NOT born to be a good programmer?I want to be the best — someone recognized and respected at work.",

        "author": "umbrofer",

        "content": "Hey guys, I'm feeling really frustrated. I've been self-studying HTML, CSS and PHP, but I keep hitting these mental blocks that make me feel like I'm not making progress or that I'm too dumb to ever get this.My question is: Does anyone have experience with or know platforms where I can hire an online tutor? Like, private PHP lessons? Would it be worth it?If anyone's been through this or has tips to overcome these blocks, I'd really appreciate the help!So here's my story... I started by training my programming logic and spent about 3 months watching video lessons and studying basics: operators, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, arrays. Up to that point, it was okay - I could do exercises (some were hard, but I could work through them).The problems started when I got to callbacks, Promises, async/await and try/catch. These concepts just wouldn't click no matter how many explanations I watched.I got so tired of just doing exercises and watching videos that I switched to PHP (because I wanted to build something real to stay motivated). The basics (operators, loops, functions) were fine since they're similar to JS. (Not sure if this was the right choice, but I thought about creating a login system and saw PHP would work well - just needed to download Laragon and start, and I'm actually liking PHP.)But when it came time to actually code and start the project, I froze. I'd search online, I could understand what the code was doing - like I understood how the database connection worked conceptually - but when I went to type it out, I just couldn't remember the whole code. I felt like I was just copying and pasting, even if the code worked in the end, and everyone says this hurts real learning.To make it worse, a coworker (who also studies) told me that in 3 months he was already way beyond this and that I should try harder. This gave me a massive mental block - it feels like no matter how much I study, I'm not getting anywhere.",

        "content": "This summer, I’m focusing on trying to land a software engineering internship for Summer 2026. I have 11 distraction free weeks before the fall semester starts, and I plan on dedicating 7-9 hours 6 days per week for this. I’m starting completely from zero with no coding experience, so my plan is to spend the first 5 weeks learning Python/core programming concepts, and then spend the next 6 weeks learning DSA and beginning Leetcode problems for interview prep. I’ll also work on creating a resume and 2-3 projects , then eventually start applying in late August/early September. I wanted to know if this 11-week plan makes sense and is realistic — spending the first 5 weeks learning Python and core programming concepts(ex. Cs50, freecodecamp), then the next 6 weeks focusing on learning dsa/LeetCode and building projects. Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks?Worst case scenario, I’m prepared to keep applying until the latest which from what I’ve seen will be January. By then I should hopefully be fully ready for interviews with a complete resume ? I know the importance of applying early in august/early September so I was also wondering if applying in January would even be worth applying since it might be too late.Sorry for the long post, I’ve been thinking about this a lot and i feel like more experienced peoples opinion on this would help me gauge my situation better. Any advice or insight from people with knowledge or who’ve been in a similar spot would mean a lot. Thank you!",

I learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Then someone told me Android development was better, so I started learning Java. Midway, I got attracted to game development and began learning C++ with Unreal Engine. I even built a small game, but things got too complex and my parents weren’t supportive of game dev as a career.So I dropped that and went back to web development… but I had already forgotten a lot, so I had to start over. Now college is over, I’m still stuck at the beginner-to-intermediate level in front-end web dev, and I feel like I’ve wasted time jumping between paths. :disappointed_face:I want to get a job soon, but I don’t know what I should focus on anymore.

Some people say PHP is dying, others say it’s still strong. MERN is used a lot, but will it stay popular? Django seems nice too, especially since Python is also used in AI and data science.I want to learn something I enjoy, but also something that can help me get a job in the future.So, for those of you with more experience:Which one do you think will still be in demand 5 years from now, and why?Thanks a lot for your advice!",

So everything I designed and created including DB was under me and I used every naming conventions that is standard when designing a SQL DB. Now that I have moved to a small startup,this is the first time I am building something where DB design wasn't done by me so I am not even sure if this is the correct way but all these years of Machine Learning I have never seen a DB design like this.There is around 500 tables on the DB with no naming conventions, barely any primary key or foreign key. So I decided to do a compare to find common column names so it makes my work easier to extract the data, but turns out even the names of the columns that are joint is different it could be subscription_id in one column and original_subscription_id somewhere else. So many inconsistency that I am not able to find proper relationship. To further this issue many tables are many to many relationship. My question based on everything is1. Is there true in other organization? 2. Is there a way to fix this without refactoring the entire DB?3. As ML guy I rely on DB so pulling them and finding relationship is important. I thought of brute forcing the relationship by finding such similarities but the DB is vast.So I am not even sure how to approach it. 4. The last option is to build the entire DE pipeline and fix this but given that I am the only there and building it will take time,I am planning to do it on the sideThank you everyone for your assistance.P.S.:I tried asking this question on Software Engineering but it got removed.",

The job required a lot of 'duct tape' fixing, including fixing GCP infrastructure configurations, making SQL queries to retireve data requesters wanted, etc, and mostly just plugging holes in a garbage codebase that management never ever has patience or budget to fix/rewrite/redesign correctly.Thus my skills aren't exactly stellar, Java/Spring-wise, as it was proven to me on my second project.Anyhow, in my spare time I tried out Rust and I loved it, but...the reality of job market.I'm looking to get back in, and I really don't want to go back to Java. Don't want to go to Spring. I especially don't want the OOP infested garbage, with Clean Code (TM) principles everywhere, forcing me to control+click through one tiny function that calls three functions, each of them calling three functions, making me completely forget what it was I was following/debugging by the fourth class/file I have to open and read through.At the same time I am familiar with crazyness of Javascript (which Typescript would alleviate somewhat), I don't want Microsoft products (C#, .NET). I am considering Golang at the moment, and I would really not be against Rust or something purely FP even (I have played around with Elm a bit and damn does that thing seem immune to errors)But, once again, realities of job market. I am not a senior dev, mid at best, and I'd rather have higher odds of finding a job within a few months, rather than low odds in a year+ after grueling amount of learning.Should I just grit my teeth, brush up on my Java/Spring starting from fundamentals (which are lacking in my case), or don't listen to naysayer-thoughts and keep up with Rust and maybe Golang on the side as it's easy enough to be complementary, or something else entirely?",

I'm trying to get into high performance and data-intensive application development, but for the summer I have some free time to learn something apart curricula and C++ related stuff I learn myself. The plan is to improve math skills like discrete math and calculus, finish CLRS, and get some of parallel programming techniques. But also I'd like to learn another programming language. Apart from C++ I have some knowledge of C#, Python and Ruby. Next year I have a DSA course in Java. So main candidates are C# or Java as they somewhere in between of C++ and Python. But I also consider Rust. Does it sufficient to know some Rust along with C++ or it's better to gain some expertise in a quite different language?",

I can't get a job related to my course because my skills aren’t good enough for their qualifications, so I’m currently applying at McDonald's or Mang Inasal. After working for 1 to 3 years, I plan to go back to school, but with a different course, because I realized that IT might not be for me, and I regret figuring this out so late. I’m considering taking Mechatronics Engineering or Computer Engineering at BatStateU or BulSU.Plan B is to continue studying and get a part-time job, but it’ll be hard for me to focus on school because my problems aren’t just about time, my family situation is also difficult. IT requires more time and focus to develop good skills, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up.I’m scared that if I choose Plan A, it’ll take me much longer to graduate. But if I go with Plan B, I might not be able to focus on my studies, and it could hurt my mental health even more (plan A also).We live with our lola, but our living situation isn’t good (can't share) for me and my siblings. I’m the eldest, and I want to move out with my siblings. We don’t have parents, only our lola, and she’s getting old fast. I can’t depend on her anymore. My aunts and uncles try to help my lola to support our schooling, but they have their own families and responsibilities. My friends advised me to move out alone, study at another school, and stay in a dorm, but I’m worried about leaving my siblings behind.What should I choose?Sorry if this might not related.Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "I'm doing some school projects for the first time, having only written mathematical algorithms and classic introduction to programming-type programs before and I have a problem with this. Basically, I don’t know if it's better to figure stuff out on my own and just do whatever works at the moment, or if I should always take advantage of preexisting solutions. The latter seems boring, to just sit through hundreds of docs and I genuinely doubt people actually do that, but when I try to make stuff by myself, I don't know if it will become hard to manage slop the more features I add and by the time I realise I will have wasted all that time to then rewrite the entire structure of the program. For a more specific example, I am writing a javaFX app. I'm currently trying to make a modular design where I will have one master controller which is responsible for showing or hiding elements of the UI and a bunch of sub controllers to handle those separate UI menus. I made it such that each sub controller holds a reference to its master and runs some kinda update function of the master so that the master is also informed of all UI changes and can evaluate some stuff or facilitate communication between the sub controllers. Technically this works and I understand it well because I had this idea myself. But then I read somewhere that this is bad because it couples the different components too much and may become unwieldy or whatever, and that maybe I should look into something like Google Guava EventBus, but that's another hour of learning where I could just think of stuff on my own instead.Basically, is there any value in using minimal dependancies and just making shit up to learn, or should I follow stricter guidelines on established solutions, even though it's boring?",

But to be honest, I still get confused with concepts like loops and overall logic-building. So yeah, you can guess where I stand in terms of coding skills: beginner level.Now, I have a one-month break, and I was planning to revise both C and Python from the basics so I don't struggle in my 2nd year. The main reason is that in the 3rd semester, we have to study DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) using Python and C.But here's where I'm confused:Everyone is saying \"Don't waste time relearning basics, start with DSA directly in one language. Once you master DSA in one language, switching to another isn't a big deal.\"Some suggest doing DSA in Python, and others say C++ is better for DSA.As someone who's just starting out and hasn't really explored much in the coding world yet, I’m feeling stuck. I don’t know which path to follow. I just want to be confident and not fall behind when DSA classes begin.So please, any guidance would mean a lot:Should I revise Python/C basics first?Which language is better to start DSA with as a beginner: Python or C++?What would you do if you were in my place?Please don’t ignore this post – I genuinely need advice from those who’ve been through this. :folded_hands:",

        "author": "garyspzhn",

        "content": "I’m a 10YOE dev who talks a big game, i fail interviews from time to time like anyone else but my success rate in recent years is particularly high, so I just tried my hand at a company whose job posting was way too good to be true, passed the initial screener and coding assessment with flying colors, but fumbled the opportunity in the most disheartening way. Here’s the story: The CS job market isn’t as black-and-white as you may imagine, there are still a lot of companies that don’t exactly know what they’re doing, they’ll offer you a competitive salary and put you through the ringer, but they’ll still manage to cut through candidates just by following due process and putting the pressure on them. I’ve been writing PHP for 13 years, and up until 2 years ago I’ve done PHP in production, on-and-off for 10 years, but I naturally moved on to JavaScript, Python, and Java because nobody wants us. In other words, I thought I’ll never see another PHP role again, so I stopped searching for them, stopped calling myself a PHP specialist, stopped reading up on latest versions, and got rusty, then a company that uses PHP found me, and they were offering me an insanely good deal, so I jumped at the role. The online assessment was easy, it was medium leet code that required PHP, and I’m great at PHP, so it took me 10 minutes. The screening interview was even easier, we were supposed to talk for 30 minutes, we spoke for 90 minutes, the guy told me what to expect in the technical interview (because I asked), he mentioned all the standards buzzwords like system design and application design, then went into the details, got more particular, told me to brush up on my redis and Java, MVC frameworks, MySQL and security protocols, so I did that - huge mistake. The technical interview was far more like a “screener” than anything else, we didn’t cover system design as intricately as I thought, a lot of what transpired was a pop quiz with questions like “do you know what traits are?” and “do you know what anonymous functions are and how they’re used?” This was supposed to take 45 minutes, I had him on the video chat for 2 hours, I acted clueless the whole time, not because I didn’t know what half the answers were, but because I didn’t study for a pop quiz, i was shocked, I was nervous, I was stressed, I was angry, and most importantly, I was disappointed in myself, because this was the luckiest break ever, and I ruined it. At one point I was so lost, I was second guessing myself, so he did me a favor and shared a codepen, I passed the little “coding challenge” he looked relieved, said “okay so you know this” then resumed the pop quiz, which again, I bombed. Guess what I did to prepare for this interview? Yep, you guessed it! Leet Code and online lectures. Why did i go this route? Tech forums convinced me the job market is an AI-driven rat race and the hiring manager confirmed the bias for me, but I would’ve passed the technical if I just opened and read PHP documentation like the good old days. So the moral of the story is, do all your general interview prep periodically, and when you get the actual interview, just read the documentation, because you never know what kind of interviewer you’re gonna get. Do not be me.",

Those that have been working for a few years now, what are your future plans for your career as we face the incoming AI onslaught? It's wild witnessing such a paradigm shift that will literally affect almost every aspect of our lives. We got a bit of a sneak preview, working in tech. Now AI tools are becoming more mainstream and everyone that's trying to make a buck is rushing to either incorporate AI into their product, or make a new AI product. At some point the barrier to entry for coding will be completely mitigated by AI. As long as you can articulate the concepts in natural speech, your idea can be created. We're not there yet, but quickly trending toward it. I personally try to take all the AI hype with a grain of salt, especially with claims like \"AI wrote 30% of Google's new code\" and such that talk up the very same products they're trying to sell. But it can still do plenty of coding, I'm sure most of us know well by now. At this point you have to embrace or get left behind, it seems. Maybe some don't agree with this notion? I'm at 6 YOE and would like to continue in this industry as long as I can. I'm just not sure where on the spectrum of 'get good at React' and 'get good at spoon feeding chatgpt your project requirements\" we're at. Developer roles will look different in 5 years. So, just curious how others are approaching things. Do you feel comfortable in your current role? Continuing to learn new languages/frameworks/whatever as needed for the job? Or focusing on building an army of AI agents? Have you embraced AI into your workflow, or been resistant? Any long term projections?",

        "author": "Organic-Pipe-8139",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just did another mock interview with another Staff Engineer from Open AI I’d argue this is the near perfect solution for Design K Leaderboard for Facebook comments or videos. To be honest the design was so impressive, I was struggling to keep up.Here is the full video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&)So this is exactly how a person of this caliber nailed the interview step by step:What I really liked is how he handled the ambiguity of the problem. He kept asking clarifying questions, gradually narrowing down what exactly the system needed to do. He started by defining the scope, deciding to track trending content globally and focusing mainly on real user reactions (ignoring edge cases like bot farms). He emphasized the need for real-time or near real-time updates, especially important when people refresh their pages a lot.He moved on to data modeling and decided to track each event (like user reactions) with details like user ID, post ID, reaction type, and timestamp (this one was critical as he spent an incredible amount of time later on discussing how bad clocks really are in a distributed system). Importantly, each user only has one reaction per post at any time, which simplifies some of the complexity.Then he dove into the scaling challenges. He chose a regional approach for data handling, using local timestamps for consistency within each region, and came up with this clever \"hot/cold\" key strategy. Basically, popular (\"hot\") posts update almost instantly, while less popular (\"cold\") posts don't need frequent updates. Regions share their top posts periodically to keep the global leaderboard updated.Interviewee didn't tie himself down to a specific database or any tools in general. Unlike mid level engineers, he actually used zero tools at all and just kept the interview on the conceptual level. He even mentioned a custom solution might be better than something traditional, highlighting using write-ahead logs and processing events separately from aggregating them. I bet this might be because he spent most of his career at Google (Youtube & Spanner) as well as Meta and OpenAI where tools are mostly proprietary and made in house.He implicitly acknowledged the CAP theorem, but explained that real systems don’t work like research papers referring to CRDB aka CockroachDB, which claims to be both available & consistent. Even when it “feels like” consistency is important, you almost always want to prioritize availability and default eventual consistency rather than absolute consistency. This practical decision means the system stays reliable even if it's not theoretically perfect.He showed how practical trade-offs matter more than absolute precision. Losing or misordering a small percentage of events is okay if it means the system stays fast and scalable.Interviewee leveraged the idea of data distribution, noting most posts have low engagement, while a few blow up. This influenced his \"hot/cold\" strategy, optimizing resources.One subtle yet powerful idea he stressed was \"monotonicity.\" By ensuring updates always move in one direction (like engagement always increasing), the system becomes much simpler to reconcile and scale.Finally, his incremental approach to design really stood out. He started broad, refined step by step, and wasn't afraid to revisit decisions. Overall, it's one of the best example of how real-world system design works and how a true staff engineer really behaves like. Managing complexity and making smart trade-offs rather than trying to build a theoretically perfect system. I definitely learned a ton from this one as an interviewer, but curious to hear what you all might think. TL;DR\\- Ask questions, don't make assumptions, don't use tools mindlessly, and use the experience you got on the job to impress the interviewer on the design.",

I know for the matter of fact and have accepted it that my resume will never stand out amongst 100s if not 1000s of applications on every job post.I’m not the type to post on X or LinkedIn every day to build a personal brand ( I did started a youtube channel though). I don’t have what it takes to contribute to open source just to maybe get noticed ( I know open source contribution is not meant to seen as a way to get job, but it is what it is). I just wanted to quietly do good work, but that doesn’t seem to count for much anymore.I feel like I’m shouting into the void. I used to love building things, but now it just feels like I’m stuck. No one wants experience unless it’s from a specific company or school maybe.I’m seriously wondering if it’s time to walk away, and leave tech entirely. I don’t even know what I’d do instead, and that scares me.Has anyone been through this? Which field do you think I can pivot into as a tech guy, so that I can earn almost similar and more in the longer run ?p.s: I took help of gpt to write this post, to express what I am actually feeling.",

Undeterred I emailed back stating that I would be willing to interview for the entry level position. As a bit of a preface, I was recently laid-off with 7 years of SE II experience. I'm not proud, just hungry. The recruiter called back almost immediately after receiving the email sounding surprised that I would still be interested in interviewing for the position. We talk about why the interest in the company, we joke, recruiter is laughing. Then they ask about the tech stack and languages that I am have experience with: Jenkins pipelines, python, c/c++, C#, Jira. Do you have any work experience with Java? Unfortunately I don't, but I do have experience in C# which is another OOP language. \"I'm sorry,\" says the recruiter, \"but the position explicitly requires experience in Java.

I think when I come back I’ll continue to have to work many weekends and nights and don’t want to keep the company a chance. We are very likely going to have a layoff in August (they have layoff every 6 months/ 1 year) and I think I may try to get laid off. If they don’t do it I may just quit if I continue to have to work long hours. Will it be possible for me to re enter the industry after only 1 YoE? I should also mention I have a 2.5 GPA so new grad applications that ask GPA won’t work. I’m thinking after I leave I’ll spend some time traveling and trying other non traditional careers to try and leave the industry but know it likely won’t work out.

        "content": "I’ve been feeling lost and pretty low for the past few years, especially since I had to choose a university and course. Back in 2022, I was interested in Computer Science, so I chose the nearest college that offered a new BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence. In hindsight, I realize the course was more of a marketing tactic — using the buzzword \"AI\" to attract students.The curriculum focused mainly on basic CS concepts but lacked depth. We skimmed over data structures and algorithms, touched upon C and Java programming superficially, and did a bit more Python — but again, nothing felt comprehensive. Even the AI-specific modules like machine learning and deep learning were mostly theoretical, with minimal mathematical grounding and almost no practical implementation. Our professors mostly taught using content from GeeksforGeeks and JavaTpoint. Hands-on experience was almost nonexistent.That said, I can’t blame the college entirely. I was dealing with a lot of internal struggles — depression, lack of motivation, and laziness — and I didn’t take the initiative to learn the important things on my own. I do have a few projects under my belt, mostly using OpenAI APIs or basic computer vision models like YOLO. But nothing feels significant. I also don’t know anything about front-end or back-end development. I’ve just used Streamlit to deploy some college projects.Over the past three years, I’ve mostly coasted through — maintaining a decent GPA but doing very little beyond that. I’ve just finished my third year, and I have one more to go.Right now, I’m doing a summer internship at a startup as an ML/DL intern, which I’m honestly surprised I got. The work is mostly R&D with a bit of implementation around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and I’m actually enjoying it. But it's also been a wake-up call — I’m realizing how little I actually know. I’m still relying heavily on AI to write most of my code, just like I did for all my previous projects. It’s scary. I don’t feel prepared for the job market at all.I’m scared I’ve fallen too far behind. The field is so saturated, and there are people out there who are far more talented and driven. I have no fallback plan. I don't know what to do next. I’d really appreciate any guidance — where to start, what skills to focus on, which courses or certifications are actually worth doing. I want to get my act together before it's too late. Honestly, it feels like specializing this early might have been a mistake.",

Will most definitely be looking into the masters now.Edit 2: I initially thought it might be fastest to just get through the bachelor's with my existing credits, but getting a Master's seems like it will be better for my career as many job listings prefer a Master's.",

I start doing my hobbies on autopilot rather than enjoying them. After work, I'm either so mentally drained from tech stuff, socially drained from meetings, or my brain just keeps firing about work stuff even when I don't want it to.My romantic relationships have suffered because of this because I can't find it in me to help with planning, nor am I good at being emotionally present. Even small things like cleaning feel like they take too much mental energy that I don't have. I've found ways to cope -- like getting meal subscription kits instead of cooking, buying a robovac + moving into a smaller space, but I'm only doing that: coping. When I was in college, even in the worst semesters, I was able to cook meals for myself and enjoy the process of cooking, enjoy my hobbies, and not feel constantly drained. I just want that back.I've been in therapy consistently, am on meds for ADHD, and while it's gotten marginally better since I left college, it still sometimes feels awful. A lot of my friends are in similar positions.Do any of yall have advice on how to make this better? How do I make job + life feel less overwhelming and more balanced?",

They had a multiple choice question that was the typical “what does the following code output?” Except it was a convoluted mess of METACLASSES and DECORATORS! Never thought I would see those on a test. Then the coding question was at least at the level of LC Medium. Anagram type question with multiple arrays. Had to be done efficiently. I kept getting time limit exceeded. And here’s the part that makes me say that Adaface specifically is the worst. They were giving me “advice” to try to put print statements in my code to debug. So I did, ran the tests again… zero visible output. There was no separate console, I clicked around everywhere, either it was hidden somewhere or not explained in the demo but I was out of luck. Couldn’t see what I printed anywhere. Eventually I had to give up and there’s no way I’m getting an interview from this.Good luck out there guys.",

I never saw a researcher get their work out to production early on in my career, and now it seems like ops is an expectation of the ML / researcher role. part of the reason thats possible is how good the tooling is now. not everything has to be rewritten to c, or created from scratch in a matrix compatible arrangement of html + css + vanilla js.I havent worked with young devs since 2018. so I guess I am wondering, what kinds of work are jr developers being expected to do today? is there still a lot of the same kind of work I started out doing or is it different? appreciate any insights people might offer.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Recently, I switched my major from biology to cs. This summer, I’m focusing on trying to land a software engineering internship for Summer 2026. I have 11 distraction free weeks before the fall semester starts, and I plan on dedicating 7-9 hours 6 days per week for this. I’m starting completely from zero with no coding experience, so my plan is to spend the first 5 weeks learning Python/core programming concepts, and then spend the next 6 weeks learning DSA and beginning Leetcode problems for interview prep. I’ll also work on creating a resume and 2-3 projects , then eventually start applying in late August/early September. I wanted to know if this 11-week plan makes sense and is realistic — spending the first 5 weeks learning Python and core programming concepts(ex. Cs50, freecodecamp), then the next 6 weeks focusing on learning dsa/LeetCode and building projects. Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks? Worst case scenario, I’m prepared to keep applying until the latest which from what I’ve seen will be January. By then I should hopefully be fully ready for interviews with a complete resume ? I know the importance of applying early in august/early September so I was also wondering if applying in January would even be worth applying since it might be too late. Sorry for the long post, I’ve been thinking about this a lot and i feel like more experienced peoples opinion on this would help me gauge my situation better. Any advice or insight from people with knowledge or who’ve been in a similar spot would mean a lot. Thank you!",

        "author": "jetfire2K",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm currently working as a junior full-stack developer, but I’ve realized that I enjoy backend development much more. Over the past few months, I’ve been focusing on backend fundamentals to deepen my understanding and prepare for interviews. I’ve revisited and studied in depth key topics like SQL, databases, system design, object-oriented programming, design patterns, relevant networking concepts and important backend (middleware, authentication, authorization, etc...) most of which I had already studied at university. I've also studied lots of interview questions as a way to make sure I didn't miss any core concepts or information regarding those topics.I practice LeetCode regularly and my resume is in good shape, not exceptional at all since I only have 9 months of work experience, zero internships and 0 unique projects but what I do have is well written.Right now, I feel a bit lost on what to pursue next. I’ve gone through several backend roadmaps and found that I’m familiar with most topics (I'm not familiar with Kafka/RabbitMQ for example but that's about the only core thing I found that I didn't know about in the roadmaps) to some degree. For example, I use Docker at work but have never built a container from scratch. I know Redis is used for caching, but I’ve only interacted with it indirectly — I’m aware it’s there but haven’t configured or used it myself.I wouldn’t call myself an expert, and while I’m willing to dive deeper into tools or concepts if the need arises, I don’t want to study things “just to know them.” Recently, I’ve shifted my mindset to studying topics that genuinely interest me (with the exception of LeetCode, unfortunately). This approach has helped me avoid burnout and actually enjoy learning, I’ve had fun practicing some complex SQL queries and exploring system design lately as an example.Some options I’ve considered:* Learning AWS: I’ve only had minimal exposure to AWS. While it's useful and often mentioned in job listings, I don’t feel drawn to it, especially since I’m unlikely to use it in personal projects.* Building personal projects: I struggle to come up with backend-focused ideas that I’m genuinely excited about. Most of my current projects aren’t particularly unique. I tend to use AI for frontend work because I don’t enjoy it, but I’d prefer to avoid relying on AI in personal projects as the goal is to improve my skills.* Exploring Java & Spring Boot: Since I primarily use the MERN stack, learning Java Spring Boot could open up more job opportunities. I’ve considered making projects with it and creating two tailored resumes (one for Node.js, one for Java). However, the idea of learning a whole new stack solely for the resume is demotivating — it feels like something I have to do, not something I want to do. I’ve also heard it’s better to stick to one stack and get really good at it, and while I’m not an expert in Node.js, I know it well enough to build things and fill gaps as I go.* Learning React.js: This is probably the last thing I want to do which is to learn proper frontend to qualify as full stack engineer instead of using AI for frontend, I really enjoyed frontend at work because it had minimal css and minimal design implementation, most of the time I was working on things related to logic. I've tried to learn react several times before but I just get bored/ lose interest really quickly due to having to implement designs and using css, I enjoy logic just not anything related to styling.At this point, I’m looking for direction. Ideally, I’d like to strengthen my backend skills in a practical or theoretical way, add something to my resume that helps me stand out or both if possible since I'm trying to leave my current job to work more as a backend specialist.",

        "content": "Excuse me if I come across as whining, immature and/or petty. My thoughts are all over the place. I have been working for a large bank for nearly 4.5+ years up until now, ever since I graduated from college in May 2020. I was working in a Teradata Dev role nearly 4 years and internally transitioned to on Observability Engineering role about 2 months ago. I primarily accepted the opportunity to switch internally because it was offering a fat pay raise in my base comp, and I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself in one tech stack and get chance to learn new skills in the observability world and I also thought this role would be less red tape as my previous role.But now 2ish months into my current role, I can see similar patterns of corporate BS from my prior role: shaky communication with scrum masters, shitty documentation, lack of documentation for critical initiatives, a bit of unclear direction in certain tasks I’m working on, and being thrown into tasks without additional support, slow traction and approval for in POCs which my manager said would be in the pipelines, SREs trying to dump their work on Engineering side. Amidst this, I feel like I’m kinda forced and forcing myself to just maintain the optics of seeming like I’m doing work(proposing new initiatives, exploring self initiated POCs to bring to table, partaking in meetings, asking questions, engaging in code reviews/pull request reviews and trying to do the work assigned me to even if it entails some level of handholding). My team manager and tech leads who interviewed me , I clearly told them I don’t have experience in this stack being used in this role , and despite that they still offered the position and for the most part I’d say I’m pretty active in ramping up quickly and continuing to learn the tech stack used in this role. But right now my scrum master is kinda gate keeping some of the deliverables in our engineering team and I feel he’s sorta pushing tasks to me which he wants to be prioritized more heavily , but those certain tasks they’re kinda outta my reach and there’s very limited internal support to lean onto and shadow along side with them. All in all, I really came excited into this new role to really be plugged in to high impact work, with little to no corporate BS, red tape , crystal clear communication, and tasks where new onboarded folks can gradually pick up and ramp . But right now I feel like I’m thrown into a deep end and barely floating and treading water. I feel like even though I’ve delivered some tasks and my tech leads are supportive, my scrum master assigns certain in which there’s no meaningful documentation on nor internal support and I can’t seem to move much forward without butting heads into him (in a neutral manner)Overall what I’m trying to convey is , I feel like shit and I think I’m going to be perceived as a phony , regardless of how proactively I’m putting effort in.This is really taxing and taking a toll on my confidence in how I can deliver in a highly regulated ass environment like banking. Id really like to jump ship by next 4ish-6ish months by the end of the year and would love to work outside a banking environment , preferably a startup or industry outside of banking altogether.I need help fam. Idk what I just spilled. For those of whom were in similar situation or circumstances as me, what did you do ? Did you move out to a different industry altogether or a startup ? Is it possible to avoid these in a startup",

My role is safe since it is a smaller company but if I ever want to switch paths I think it will be difficult. For example if companies require 2+yoe on web development or database knowledge, I will not have any experience on my resume to showcase that.I guess my question is, would it be a good idea to brush up on my full stack and leetcode to round out my experience?

I can't seem to keep an idea of things like polymorphism, SOLID, oop, and especially the dreaded language features and other unknown (to me) unknowns. Does anyone know what these types of concepts are called and how I can maybe find some YT videos talking about them so I can try to learn? (My languages of interest in case it matters are JavaScript, Python, Java). Tia!",

        "content": "Some of these may be obvious but I guess it wasn't for me.1.) during coding rounds, verbalize to confirm understanding not to express thinkingI used to think that I should vocalize all my thoughts and avoid any silence. This has proven to be problematic for a few reasons. First, when you're initially reading the question, vocalizing will unnecessarily slow you down. Second, you probably don't sound very smart when you're quickly reading the question like that, you might start looking for ways to condense sentences, skip over certain sentences, etc. It's all unnecessary.The time to vocalize your thoughts is after you've read it and to then confirm your understanding of the question with the interviewer.Then instead of brainstorming out loud the very first thing that comes to mind. I would ask for another minute to think of how you'd approach the question. The problem with saying the very first thing that comes to mind is that if it's obviously wrong then the interviewer may correct you which would be interpreted as giving you a hint which would count against you. After you've wrestled with the idea for a bit only then share your solution out loud with the interviewer.I wouldn't even bother mentioning an obvious brute force solution if you already have a better idea in mind since talking about the brute force will cut into your time.So the TLDR here is to be more strategic about when to vocalize your thought process.2.) during non-coding rounds, wait for your turn to talk, never interrupt the interviewerThis will probably be obvious to most but I used to interrupt the interviewer near the beginning. Not intentionally. If they said something that I thought would make for a really interesting question, then I would ask it right there when there was a natural pause in the conversation.I now realize this is very bad. It's always better to wait till you're sure that they are done speaking or until they ask you if you have any questions. You gain nothing by interrupting them but can easily make a bad impression and decrease the signal you give from your question by asking during a time in which they aren't fully ready to evaluate you since they still need to get through the rest of what they wanted to say. Plus, they might have brought up an even better point later on.3.) during a hiring manager round, to express that you're serious about the role, interview the interviewerYou can't tell the interviewer that you really want the position. That you've deeply thought about staying at the company in the long term. That you are a top candidate.You can only express these things by asking tough questions that make the interviewer think and possibly feel like they're being interviewed. Obviously you don't want to take this too far. You should ask questions that show you've deeply thought about the company's business model and how the role you're being hired for aligns with that. You should ask questions to see how clearly the hiring manager understands what will be needed for the role. It is genuinely a red flag if you're being hired for a role in which the hiring manager is not sure about what you'll be working on. Think about what other things could be red flags as well and ask some pointed (but still polite) questions about those.My current strategy for this is to split my preparation for this part of the interview over 2 days. On day 1 I learn as much as I can from quick online research about the company and do my best to come up with questions of substance. On day 2 I try again and this is when I come up with much higher quality questions.",

Some of the remaining questions were things I just didn’t remember from courses a year or two ago that I knew I’d wanna slap myself for forgetting since once I looked up the answer it was an “OH RIGHT!” moment.The other questions were just something I got really nervous and wasn’t thinking clearly — after I left the interview and thought of it for a couple minutes I got the answer and was pissed.Whats your advice for how to pick yourself up after something like this? I’m really mad at myself, especially since interviews feel so rare so it feels like I fucked up my one good chance",

        "content": "Hey all,I've been placed into the DevOps team in my company as a junior (graduated '24). For the past year i rotated through different software engineering teams, (web dev, api dev, and devOps). Ultimately the choice of where I was placed came down to budgeting/factors out of my control. From what I've read online, it seems that alot of people dont believe in having a junior working in DevOps lol. My interest has always been in Web Dev (backend) mostly because thats all ive worked on in my personal time/ internships. Im wondering though, would it be wise to embrace a new career path in DevOps, or should I look for a new web dev position?TLDR: In the long run, which career path (DevOps vs. Backend Web Dev) would offer more opportunities and stability?",

        "content": "Background:A bit about me: before finishing school (I have about 1.5 yrs left), I was able to land a job as a software engineer and worked in the industry for 2.5 years. I was laid off in late 2022, and as I haven't been able to secure another position, I am currently in the process of returning to school to complete my business degree (at an ivy). I originally chose not to finish the degree it as I thought it wouldn't be relevant for a career in software, but I now realize that was a mistake.I still have a passion for software and hope to stay in this field, but I'm uncertain about which positions I can go for. Once I regain student status, should I be looking for a summer internship, volunteering during school, or focusing on finding a full-time role after graduation?(I just wanted to ask whether companies would even consider me for an intern position, given that I already have a few years of experience, and also due to my age)Thank you for your feedback :)",

From what I’ve heard in interviews it is a fast pace company so not the type of job to coast.Company B offer: $160k baseIt is an AI startup that has already secured funding for the year and is actually already profitable. It’s a cool product and there is very strong demand for the product within the space and a very promising growth plan. It’s also a fast pace environment. The role is hybrid (3 days) and my commute is about 20 min but I can move walking distance to the office in 3 months.Both jobs are for a midlevel full stack dev and I have 3.5 YOE. Same tech stack which I have experience in. Mainly wondering if it is worth it to go for an AI startup due to growth potential even tho it is hybrid and pays less. It also feels like all of the pros of a startup without any of the risk. But I also know there can be a lot of chaos in a startup environment so I’m not sure if I am ignoring that.",
