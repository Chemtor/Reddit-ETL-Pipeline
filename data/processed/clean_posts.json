I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.But the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.All the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",

        "content": "Disclaimer: I am not a data engineer, I'm a total outsider. My background is 5 years of software engineering and 2 years of DevOps/SRE. These days the only times I get in contact with DE is when I am called out to look at an excessive error rate in some random ETL jobs. So my exposure to this is limited to when it does not work and that makes it biased.At my previous job, the entire data pipeline was written in Python. 80% of the time, catastrophic failures in ETL pipelines came from a third-party vendor deciding to change an important schema overnight or an internal team not paying enough attention to backward compatibility in APIs. And that will happen no matter what tech you build your data pipeline on.But Python does not make it easy to do lots of healthy things like ensuring data is validated or handling all errors correctly. And the interpreted, runtime-centric nature of Python makes it - in my experience - more difficult to debug when shit finally hits the fan. Sure static type linters exist, but the level of features type annotations provide in Python is not on the same level as what is provided by a statically typed language. And I've always seen dependency management as an issue with Python, especially when releasing to the cloud and trying to make sure it runs the same way everywhere.And yet, it's clearly the most popular option and has the most mature ecosystem. So people must love it.What are you guys' experience reaching to Python for writing your own ETL jobs? What makes it great? Have you found more success using something else entirely? Polars+Rust maybe? Go? A functional language?",

        "content": "I’m a newly minted Data Engineer, with what little experience I have, I’ve noticed quite a few glaring issues with my workplace, causing me to start hating my job. Here are a few:- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. - We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. I don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem. Additionally, if there are other problems you’d like to point out (other than people being difficult to work with), please do so.",

        "content": "I keep seeing this idea repeated here:> **“The entire point of a bronze layer is to have raw data with no or minimal transformations.”**I get the intent — but I have multiple data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), where each object already comes with a well-defined schema. In my ETL pipeline, I use an automated schema validator: if someone changes the source data, the pipeline automatically detects the change and adjusts accordingly.For example, the Product object might have 300 fields, but only 220 are actually used in practice. So why ingest all 300 if my schema validator already confirms which fields are relevant?People often respond with:>> **“Standard practice is to bring all columns through to Bronze and only filter in Silver. That way, if you need a column later, it’s already there.”**But if schema evolution is automated across all layers, then I’m not managing multiple schema definitions — they evolve together. And I’m not even bringing storage or query cost into the argument; I just find this approach cleaner and more efficient.Also, side note: why does almost every post here involve vendor recommendations? It’s hard to believe everyone here is working at a large-scale data company with billions of events per day. I often see beginner-level questions, and the replies immediately mention tools like Airbyte or Fivetran. Sometimes, writing a few lines of Python is faster, cheaper, and gives you full control. Isn’t that what engineers are supposed to do?Curious to hear from others doing things manually or with lightweight infrastructure — is skipping unused fields in Bronze really a bad idea if your schema evolution is fully automated?",

I see that there is a lot of debate about the DE role itself, so I'm not sure if there is a consensus of this role either. Basically, my DE job entails creating SQL tables, but more so than that a ton of my time just goes into trying to figure out what people want without any proper guidance or documentation. I don't interact with the stakeholders but I have colleagues who are supposed to translate to me what the stakeholders want. Except that they don't...they just tell me to complete a task with my only guiding documents being PDFs, data dictionaries, other documents related to the projects. Sometimes, my only guidance is previous projects, but when I use those as templates I'm told I can't rely on that since every project is different. This ends up just being a constant back and forth stream and when there is a level of concensus reached as to what exactly the project is supposed to accomplish, it finally becomes a clean table in SQL that is frequently used as the backend data source for a front-end application for stakeholders to use (I don't build this application). I have touched Python very rarely at my job. I am supposed to get a task where I should be doing more stuff in Python but I'm not sure if that's even going to happen. I'm kind of more a technically minded person. When my job requires me to find solutions by writing code and developing, I feel like I can tolerate my job more. I'm not finding my current responsibilities technical enough for my liking. The biggest gripe I have is that the person who should be helping guide me with business/stakeholder needs is frequently too busy to communicate properly with me and never tells me what exactly the project is, what the stakeholders want and keeps telling me to 'read documents' to figure it out, documents that have zero guidance as to the project. When things get delayed because I have to spend forever trying to figure out what exactly I should be doing, there's a lot of frustration directed at me. I personally think I'd be happier as a backend SWE, but I am uncertain and would love to hear from others what they preferred between DE and SWE and why. I would consider changing to a different DE role but with SQL being the only thing I use (I do have experience otherwise in Python and JavaScript, just not at my current job), I'm afraid I'm not going to be technically competitive enough for other DE roles either. I don't know what else to consider if I want to switch jobs. I've been told my skills may transfer to project/product management but that's not at all the direction I was thinking of taking my career in....",

Would love to get some expert insights from the communityUse Case Overview:We support multiple data sources (currently 5–10, more will come) including:SQL ServerREST APIsS3BigQueryPostgresUsers can create accounts and register credentials for connecting to these data sources via a dashboard.Our service then pulls data from each source per account in 3 possible modes:Hourly: If a new hour of data is available, download.Daily: Once a day, after the nth hour of the next day.Daily Retry: Retry downloads for the last n-3 days.After download:Raw data is uploaded to cloud storage (S3 or GCS, depending on user/config).We then perform light transformations (column renaming, type enforcement, validation, deduplication).Cleaned and validated data is loaded into Postgres staging tables.Volume & Scale:Each data pull can range between 1 to 5 million rows.Considering DuckDB for in-memory processing during transformation step (fast + analytics-friendly).Which orchestration framework would you recommend for this kind of workflow and why?We're currently evaluating:Apache AirflowDagsterPrefectKey Considerations:We need dynamic DAG generation per user account/source.Scheduling flexibility (e.g., time-dependent, retries).Easy to scale and reliable.Developer-friendly, maintainable codebase.Integration with cloud storage (S3/GCS) and Postgres.Would really appreciate your thoughts around pros/cons of each (especially around dynamic task generation, observability, scalability, and DevEx).Thanks in advance!",

The benchmarks covered both full initial loads and Change Data Capture (CDC) on a large dataset (billions of rows for full load, tens of millions of changes for CDC) over a 24-hour window.More details here: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks) How the dataset was generated: [https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)# Some observations:* OLake hit \\~46K rows/sec sustained throughput across billions of rows without bottlenecking storage or compute.* $75 cost was infra-only (no license fees). Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.Sharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.Note: Full Load is free for Fivetran.",

But that didn't change, it was like that before the increase in costs.* The tables follow the \\[One Big Table\\](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/one-big-table/) data modelling * It could be something else, but the incremental in costs came just after that.My question would be, is it possible that changing the partition granularity from DAY to MONTH resulted in such a huge increase or would it be something else that we are not aware of?",

While the standard approach would be to enforce data types in the staging layer, a colleague insists on keeping all data as string and only apply the right data types in the final consumption tables. Their thinking behind this is that this gives the greatest flexibility when it comes to different asks by the business. For example if tomorrow the business wants to create another report, you are not locked down to the data types enforced in staging for the needs of the first use case. Personally I find this a bit of an odd decision but would like to hear your thoughts on this. Edit: the issue was that he once had defined a column as BIGINT only for business to come later and say decimals are allowed so they had to go back and change to Double and reload all data.In our case though we are working with BigQuery and most data types do accept nulls.",

I would like to introduce a lightweight way to add **end-to-end data validation** into data pipelines: using Python + YAML, no extra infra, no heavy UI.:right_arrow: **(Disclosure: I work at Soda, the team behind Soda Core, which is open source)****The idea is simple:**Add quick, declarative checks at key pipeline points to validate things like row counts, nulls, freshness, duplicates, and column values. To achieve this, you need a library called Soda Core. It’s open source and uses a YAML-based language (SodaCL) to express expectations.**A simple workflow:**Ingestion → :check_mark_button: pre-checks → Transformation → :check_mark_button: post-checks**How to write validation checks:**These checks are written in YAML. Very human-readable. Example: # Checks for basic validations checks for dim_customer: - row_count between 10 and 1000 - missing_count(birth_date) = 0 - invalid_percent(phone) < 1 %: valid format: phone number**Use Airflow as an example:**1. Installing Soda Core Python library2. Writing two YAML files (`configuration.yml` to configure your data source, `checks.yml` for expectations)3. Calling the Soda Scan (extra scan.py) via Python inside your DAG**If folks are interested, I’m happy to share:*** A step-by-step guide for other data pipeline use cases* Tips on writing metrics* How to share results with non-technical users using the UI* DM me, or schedule a quick meeting with me.Let me know if you're doing something similar or want to try this pattern.",

If you’re not interested in my context and motivation, feel free to skip the paragraph below and go straight to describing your day – whether by following my guiding questions or just sharing your own perspective freely.I’ve tagged this post with *career* because I’m currently in the process of applying for data engineering positions. I’ve become particularly interested in working with data in cloud environments – in the past, I’ve worked with SQL databases and also had some exposure to OLAP systems. To prepare for this role, I’ve completed several courses and built a few non-commercial projects using cloud services such as Databricks, ADF, SQL DB, DevOps, etc.Right now, I’m applying for Cloud Data Engineer positions in Azure, especially those related to ETL/ELT. I’d like to understand what everyday work in commercial projects actually looks like, so I can better prepare for interviews and get a clearer sense of what employers mean when they talk about “commercial experience.” This post is mainly addressed to those who already work in such roles.Here are some optional guiding questions (feel free to use them or just describe things your way):* What does a typical workday look like for a data engineer working with ETL/ELT tools in the cloud (Azure/GCP/AWS – mainly Data Services like Databricks, Spark, Virtual Machines, ADF, ADLS, SQL Database, Synapse, etc.)?* What kind of tasks do you receive? How do you approach them and how much time do they usually take?* How would you classify tasks as easy, medium, or advanced in terms of difficulty – could you give examples?* Could you describe the context of your current project?* Do you often use documentation and AI? What is the attitude toward AI in your team and among your managers?* What do you do when you face a problem you can’t immediately solve? What does team communication look like in such cases?* Do you take part in designing the architecture and integrating services?* What does the lifecycle of a task look like?* How do you usually communicate – is it constant interaction or more asynchronous work, e.g. through Git?I hope I managed to express clearly what I’m looking for. I also hope this post helps not only me but other aspiring data engineers as well. Looking forward to hearing from you!I’ll be truly grateful for any response – whether it’s a detailed description of your workday or more general advice and reflections.",

The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community. I haven’t worked with Fabric directly, but I understand the concepts (like medallion architecture, data governance, etc.). I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.My questions:Has anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?How much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?What would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?What other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?Appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!",

What about FiveTran/Airbyte (*may* need to get data from Salesforce and some other places in a **distant** future)? or any other industry standard solution?Exporting data on a schedule and writing Python to generate parquet files and pushing them to s3 was considered but the team wanted to see if there're other options that \"auto-extracts\" cdc changes every time it happens from the log file instead of reading cdc tables and loading them on S3 in parquet format vs pulling/exporting on a scheduled basis.",

It's \\~2 dozen azure SQL databases, none huge at all by modern standards. But they do have a LOT of tables and the transformation needs aren't trivial. And whatever we build needs to be deployable to additional instances with similar source db's ideally using some automated approach. I.e. don't want to build manually or by hand the same thing for all \\~15-20 customer instances.At this point I just need to put together a matrix of options running from \"write some python and do it manually\", to \"use parameterized data factory jobs\", to \"just buy a tool\". ADF looks a bit expensive IMO, although I don't have a ton of experience with it. Anybody been through a similar process recently? When does an expensive ETL tool become \"worth it\"? And how to sell that value when you know the pressure coming will be \"but it's free to just write python code\".",

        "content": "Hi all,**Context:**I am currently creating an ETL pipeline. The pipeline ingests rock climbing data (which was webscraped) transforms it and cleans it. Another pipeline extracts hourly 7 day weather forecast data and cleans it. The plan is to match crags (rock climbing sites) with weather forecasts using the coordinate variables of both datasets. That way, a rock climber can look at his favourite crag and see if the weather is right for climbing in the next seven days (correct temperature, not raining etc.) and plan their trips accordingly. The weather data would update everyday.To be clear, there won't be any front end for this project. I am just creating an ETL pipeline **as if** this was going to be the use case for the database. I plan on using the project to try to persuade the Senior Data Engineer at my current company to give me some real DE work.**Problem**This is the schema I have landed on for now. The weather data is normalised to only one level while the crag data being normalised into multiple levels. I think the weather data is quite simple is easy. It's just the crag data I am worried about. There are over 127,000 rows here with lots of columns that have many 1 to many relationships. I think not normalising would be a mistake and create performance issues, but again, it's my first time normalising to such an extent. I have created a star schema database but this is the first time normalising past 1 level. I just wanted to make sure everything was correctly done before I go ahead with creating the database [Schema for now](https://preview.redd.it/q4x72hcicq0f1.png?width=2501&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69f68a2b52d63aa5ce42a36a6330873ab371ed2)**The relationship is as follows:**crag --> sector (optional) --> routecrags are a singular site of climbing. They have a longitude and latitude coordinate associated with them as well as a name. Each crag has many routes on it. Typically, a single crag has one rocktype (e.g. sandstone, gravel etc.) associated with it but can have many different types of climbs (e.g. lead climbing, bouldering, trad climbing)If a crag is particularly large it will have multiple sectors, each sector will have many routes. and each sector has a name associated with them. Smaller crags will have only have one sector, called: 'Main Sector'.Routes are the most granular datapoint. Each route has a name, a difficulty grade, a safety grade and a type.I hope this explains everything well. Any advice would be appreciated",

        "content": "Hey there, Im a bit of a spark ui novice and I'm trying to understand what is creating the bottle neck in my current glue job. For this run, we were using a g.8x with 2 workers.This job took 1 hour 14, and 30 minutes of the job were between 2 jobs. A GlueParquetHadoopWriter and rdd at DynamicFrame.I am trying to optimize these two tasks so i can reduce the job run time.My current theory is that we convert our spark dataframe to a dynamic frame so that we can write partitions out to our glue tables. I think this step is the rdd at Dynamic Frame job, i think its shuffling(?) to a rdd.The second job i think is the writes to s3, this being the GlueParquetHadoopWriter. Currently if we run this job for multiple days, we have to write out partitions at the day level, which i think makes the writes take longer. Example if we run for \\~2 months, we have to partition the data to day level then write it out to s3 (60\\~ partitions).Im struggling to come up with solutions on how to increase the write speed, we need the data in this partition structure for downstream so we are pretty locked. Would writing out bulk and having another job pick the file up to repartition it be faster? My mind thinks this just means we would then pay for cold start costs twice and get no real benefit.Interested to hear ideas people have on diagnosing/speeding up these tasks!

My gripes with our current approach are:1. Our HPC cluster doesn't have good spark support. Running any spark application involves spinning an independent cluster with a series of lengthy bash scripts. We have tried to simplify this as much as possible but ease-of-use is valuable in an academic setting.2. Our rust tools are fast and efficient, but impossible to maintain since very few people are familiar with rust, MPI, multithreading... I have been experimenting with dask as an easier-to-use tool (with slurm support!) but so far it has been... not great. It seems to eat up a lot more memory than the latter two (although it might be me not being familiar with it)Any thoughts?",

        "content": "Hello,I'm a student/employee at a governmental banking institution. My contract is due to end in November of this year at which point I'll graduate and be on the job market. My work so far has been scripting in Python to aggregate data and deliver it to my supervisor who does business specific analytics in Excel. I export data from SAP Business Objects and run a Python solution on it that does all of the cleaning, aggregations and delivers multiple csv files of which only two are actively used in Excel for dashboarding.We've had problems with documentation of the upstream data that had us waste a lot of time finding the right people to explain some of the things we needed to access to do what we do. So my supervisor wants us to have a suitable, structured way of documenting our work to contribute to the enhancement of the state of Data Cataloguing at our firm.On the other hand, I haven't felt satisfied in what I've been doing so far, 7 months into the work. My motivation has declined slowly and it's quite obvious that my relationship with my supervisor has suffered from it (lack of communication, not much work on the table, etc...). I would like to change this reality and give myself the opportunity to show that I could be more of use if I'm put to work on the technical aspects more so than following the trail of my supervisor on the business oriented work. I understand that I must ultimately be in service of the business goals but as explained above, doing Python scripting on excel and csv files then letting him do the dashboarding in Excel while I sit back and wait for another need to be done isn't very fulfilling on all levels (academically, I need to showcase how I used my technical expertise in DE. Professionally, I need to show that I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining robust data pipelines. The job market is hard enough as it is for the freshly graduated, not having any actual work under my belt on some of the widely used technologies in the field of DE)Eventually, the hope is to suggest a data pipeline to replace what we've been doing so far. Instead of exporting csv and excel from SAP Business Objects, loading in them in Python, doing transformations in Python, then exporting csv and excel files for the supervisor to load them using Power Query in Excel and do his dashboarding there I suggest the following: \\- Exporting from SAP BO and immediately loading into an Object Storage System, I have experience with MinIO. \\- Ingesting data from the files into PostgreSQL as a Data Warehouse. \\- Using DBT+Python to do the Transformations & Quality Control (Is it possible to only use DBT to preprocess the data, i.e remove duplicate rows, clean up columns, build new columns? I do these in Python already) \\- Using a different tool for BI (I worked with PowerBI & Metabase before) \\- Finally, a Data Catalog to document everything we're doing. I have experience with Datahub but my company uses Informatica Axon and I don't have access to ingesting any metadata or adding any data sources.I appreciate anyone who read my lengthy post and suggested their opinion on what I should do and how I should go about this. It's a really good company to work at (from a salary and reputation pov) so having a few years here under my belt after graduating would help my career significantly but I need to be of use to them for this.",

From native support for loading data into Apache Iceberg–compatible data lakes and AI Assistants that proactively monitor connection health, to expanded advanced APIs in the Connector Builder, we continue to double down on empowering data engineering teams with the best modern open data movement solution. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/), I covered Connector Builder updates like async streams, nested compressed files, and GraphQL support. Below is a highlight of some of the newest features we’ve added.# Consolidate Data to Iceberg-Compatible Data LakesIceberg has quickly become a standard for building modern data platforms ready for providing AI-ready data to your teams. Our [Iceberg-compatible Data Lake destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-data-lake) is catalog and storage agnostic, and designed for highly scalable and performant AI and analytics workloads. With schema evolution support, along with expanded capabilities to move unstructured data and structured records all in one pipeline, you can use Airbyte to consolidate on Iceberg with confidence knowing your data is AI ready. And, with [Mappings](https://airbyte.com/blog/load-compliant-data-with-airbyte-mappers), you can share corporate data with confidence, knowing sensitive data will not be leaked.For a deep dive for data engineers on the benefits of adopting the Iceberg standard for storing both raw and processed data, and an outline of the capabilities of Airbyte's Data Lake destinations, or check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8krPElimfM).# Operate Hundreds of Pipelines in One PlaceAs the number of pipelines you need to manage with Airbyte grows, the need to oversee, monitor and manage your data pipelines in one place is critical for maintaining high data quality and data freshness. With this in mind, we're excited to introduce four new capabilities enabling you to better manage hundreds of pipelines all in one place:**Diagnose sync errors with AI**We’ve expanded AI support in Cloud Team to allow you to quickly diagnose and fix failed data pipeline syncs Instantly analyze Airbyte logs, connector documentation and known issues to help you identify root cause, and get actionable solutions, without any manual debugging required. Read more [here](https://airbyte.com/blog/diagnose-data-pipeline-sync-errors-with-ai).https://preview.redd.it/x6v1cfu63t0f1.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb94a2439bf7747d0107c107936f6bdfc3fe3935**Monitor connection health from Connections page**[Monitor the health of all your connections](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-connection-status) directly from within the Connections page using the new Connections Dashboard. This helps you quickly track down intermittent failures, and easily drill in for more information to help you resolve sync or performance issues.https://preview.redd.it/w79dsro83t0f1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=4707858cd6cc36d7481d38ee515f81e6599bbac6**Organize pipelines with connection tags**Connection Tags help to visually group and organize your pipelines, making it easier than ever to find the connections you need. You can use tags to organize connections based on any set of criteria you like: 'department' in the case of different consuming teams, 'env' for indicating if they are running in production, and anything else you like.https://preview.redd.it/12lnnj3a3t0f1.png?width=2836&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8dfbbbebbc4a9776d5b1b650172094cf138da93**Identify schema changes in the Connection timeline**The [Connection timeline now includes events for any connection settings update](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-connection-timeline): whether these be a schedule update, or a change in the connection schema. For Cloud Teams users, you can use this in conjunction with AI logging to easily diagnose why sync behavior or volumes have suddenly changed.https://preview.redd.it/p4oqcbgb3t0f1.png?width=2746&format=png&auto=webp&s=248babfb9b142aad7a5a88fc6bd2bf555d750b61# Manage Connectors as Infrastructure with Airbyte's Terraform ProviderData movement is an integral part of your application and infrastructure. We've heard plenty of feedback from users requesting better ease of use for our Terraform Provider. We are excited to announce new capabilities making it easier than ever to manage all of your connectors using the Airbyte Terraform provider to roll out changes programmatically to your dev, staging, and production environments.When building a connector in the Airbyte UI, you will now find a **Copy JSON** button at the bottom of connector configuration. You can quickly use this to export the the configuration of a connector to Terraform. This takes into account version-specific configuration settings, and can also be repurposed for configuring connectors with PyAirbyte, the Python SDK or the Airbyte API.https://preview.redd.it/eib6twxc3t0f1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4902d63dbc6a47f22f7f1cf10ba387f0f6474d# Create custom connectors directly from YAML or Docker images[New endpoints and resources have also been added](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/v-1.6#create-custom-connectors-from-yaml-or-docker-images-using-the-api-and-terraform) to the APIs and Terraform provider to allow you create and update custom connectors using a Connection Builder YAML manifest or Docker image. These endpoints do not allow you to modify Airbyte’s public connector configurations, but if you have custom endpoints within your organization and are running OSS or self-managed versions of Airbyte, these additional capabilities can be used to programmatically spin up new connectors for different environments.If you need to manage API custom connectors in infrastructure, we now recommend you build your custom connector using the Connector Builder, test it using the in-app capability for verifying your connector, then export the configuration YAML. You can then easily pass in the YAML as part of a connector resource definition in Terraform:https://preview.redd.it/5loabk9e3t0f1.png?width=3036&format=png&auto=webp&s=d732b93ad24c43e79a3c3f70766135b23bbf7488Together, these two changes will make it significantly easier to manage your entire catalog of connectors as infrastructure in code, if this is preference for you and your team.

The agent needs context, so we built a system that ingests this data, processes it, and builds a structured knowledge graph (kind of a mix of RAG and GraphRAG).What we didn’t expect was just how much infra work that would require, specifically around the data.We ended up:* Using LlamaIndex's OS abstractions for chunking, embedding and retrieval.* Adopting Chroma as the vector store.* Writing custom integrations for Slack/GitHub/Notion. We used LlamaHub here for the actual querying, although some parts were unmaintained/broken so we had to fork + fix. We could’ve used Nango or Airbyte tbh but eventually didn't do that.* Building an auto-refresh pipeline to sync data every few hours and do diffs based on timestamps/checksums..* Handling security and privacy (most customers needed to keep data in their own environments).* Handling scale - some orgs had hundreds of thousands of documents across different tools. So, we had to handle rate limits, pagination, failures, etc.I’m curious: for folks building LLM apps that connect to company systems, how are you approaching this? Are you building the pipelines from scratch too? Or is there something obvious we’re missing?We're not data engineers so I'd love to know what you think about it.",

The second company has no DE team, so I, a junior, would build everything up, currently they are manually querying SQL databases, with minor Python automation. My main concern is not being able to use sought after DE tools that will help me down the line in my next job.The first one is more standard in terms of what I'm used to, I have 2 years of experience at a similarly sized company, where DE cloud tools were used. But in my experience this kind of environment is less demanding in terms of responsibility, so I could start getting too comfortable.Which one would you choose? I'm leaning towards cloud megacorp due to stability and the future being cloud tech. Are there any arguments for choosing onprem only?Thank you for reading.",

Why would they do that without any warning or explanation beforehand or at least after archiving it? Do you think it is better to slowly prepare to switch do dbt or stay on dataform?",

I scrape and clean the data in notebooks, multiple notebooks as there are multiple tables focusing on different aspects of performance e.g. shooting, passing, defending, goalkeeping, pass types etc.I then create relationships across the tables and then load them into a database I created in Google's BigQuery. At first I collected and only used data from previous seasons to set up the database, before updating it with this current season's data. As the current season hasn't ended (actually ended last Saturday), I wanted to be able to handle more recent updates by just rerunning the notebooks without affecting other season's data. That's why the current season is handled in a different folder, and newer seasons will have their own folders too.I'm a beginner in terms of databases and the methods I use reflect my current understanding.TLDR: I built a database of Women Super League players using data scraped from Fbref.

However, there are no UI options available (other than spreadsheets) for entering metadata into dbt which means data engineers will have to be directly involved which won't scale. What can we do? Does dbt cloud ($$) provide a way to keep dbt metadata and Snowflake-entered metadata in sync BOTH WAYS through object recreations?",

        "content": "Hi,I've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like \"which language should I learn???\" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff. JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough. Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch. One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes. If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af? As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click. Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better! I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**\"People keep saying mixed things about X\" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru. Every \"wrong\" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time. Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways. I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like \"damn I'm good at this\". It's normal. Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Wow, I did not know all these people would be interested! I've created a new community for a follow-up series where I'll share more coding journey insights: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeGrind/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeGrind/)Thanks",

From their other rules, it seemed to potentially imply that they only wanted one window/tab open, so I went into this test with no resources.Suffice it to say, it didn't go so well. It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).So my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them? I figure that in the real world, methods, libraries, etc., can always be looked up, so I don't typically set aside storage space in my brain to remember all of them.

        "content": "Hey,so in short, I'm a student and we learn some basic stuff. We used csv-files now, but I want to do it using an embedded sqlite-database. Because using csv-files is something we did in every practice so far, and it's nothing new at this point. While with csv-files, the problem was to make sure you don't have redundancies, the problem with a database is now the other way around. Here is a simplified layout without any m:n:Product(id as PK, name, price) LineItem(id as PK, volume, product as FK) Sale(id as PK, lineitem as FK)Products need to be able to be updated, because you can edit them. But LineItem and in the end, Sales should not be able to change. With this normalized setup, changing the price of a product, would also change them in all line-items and sales from the past. That obviously must not happen. So what would be the best practice to save a \"history\" of Sales? Save the price in the LineItem? But what if the name changed. So saving the entire Product in the LineItem? But what if the Product becomes bigger, then I'd end up with a lot of columns in Line item, which are also not referencing.Not really sure how this should be handled. Because DB is normally to have uptodate things, but here I want uptodate things, but also a history of records that shouldn't change after i create them.",

And want help in my next steps..The main issue, is that I've lost all motivation or drive to work on the project. But I'm not sure if i should start a new one in the interim. The project isn't overly \"difficult\" and honestly I've probably finished the most difficult parts of it. The problem lies in not entirely understanding wtf I'm doing or why. The issue? I basically asked GPT to help me think of a project that was out of my scope. I normally don't use AI at all, trying to learn everything myself, only asking small questions when i get stuck for too long. But this project was kind of.. perfect? It showed how weak i was in certain areas, and I've been learning to fill the gaps.The issue is that I've been unwell, and every time i jump back into this project, i feel overwhelmed and spend more time remembering what i was doing, than actually doing anything. However I've already begun adding it on github, and i feel like, as a resume-project, it may look a little bad that i started it, and paused for a couple weeks?So I'm not sure what to do, either i force myself to cram and finish it, even just a super basic version. Or i put the entire project on hold, finish something a little smaller, to add to github, and then go back to it. I just.. feel stuck, overwhelmed, and not sure if i should just scrap it entirely tbh.",

The issue is that throughout the whole semester we only covered the mathematics side of functional declarative programming however we never had any practice. I simply cannot wrap my head around the syntax of declarative programming since what I have been learning is imperative. Everywhere i look online shows basic examples of it like \"lst = \\[x\\*2 for x in lst\\]\" and there are no examples of more complex code, e.g. nested loops or branching. On top of this, everywhere that mentions declarative programming they all say that you should not update values throughout the lifespan of the program but that is quite literally impossible. I have spoken to my teacher multiple times and joined several support sessions but i still have no clue how to program declaratively. I understand that i need to \"say what result i want, not how to get to it\" but you still write code in a specific syntax which was simply not exposed to us at a high enough lvl to be able to go and write a small program.

I never used programming in my job or personal life, and back in college, I only learned basic Java and C to pass exams, but I don’t remember much now.After a personal tragedy and an accident, I haven’t worked for the last 3 years. Now, I’m passionate about restarting my career in tech, with a focus on Python and machine learning. I’ve outlined a 6-month plan to study programming and aim for an entry-level job by then. Here’s my approach:**First 2 months**:* Learn Python basics (variables, loops, functions, data types, file handling).* Focus on NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.* Understand basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.).**Next 2 months**:* Deepen knowledge of data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.* Learn SQL for database management.* Work with APIs to practice fetching and manipulating data.**Final 2 months**:* Study machine learning basics using Scikit-learn.* Build small projects, such as data analysis or prediction models.* Practice coding problems on LeetCode or HackerRank.I also plan to start applying for entry-level jobs and internships by month 6, aiming to transition into a full-time role in tech.**Platform Questions**:* What’s the best way to learn: Udemy, YouTube, or other platforms?* Should I pay for courses on Udemy, or can I learn everything I need from free resources like YouTube or blogs?* Do I need certifications (e.g., from Coursera or Google) to get hired?* How long does it typically take from beginner to landing a job?* Has anyone here transitioned into tech through self-study? I’d love to hear your experiences!* What apps, websites, or learning platforms do you recommend for someone in my position?I’m committed and ready to put in the effort — just need to figure out the best approach.Thanks so much!",

Obviously, I'm medicated now, and that helps. My problem is trying to remember proper syntax. I can code just fine. Passed all my classes so far. Worked with C++, C#, Java, HTML, and CSS without issues EXCEPT I cannot remember proper syntax for the life of me. I know what I need to do. I know how to get there. I just can't ever remember code syntax and structure. Going from C++ to C# was especialy frustrating. I can't tell you how many times I wrote Console.PrintLine() instead of Console.WriteLine(). I constantly have to have a reference open on my computer to help me remember syntax. Here's an example: Lets say I'm building a class. I would need to have something like this open to help me remember syntax: public class MediaItem { // Properties common to all media items public string Title { get; set; } public int PublicationYear { get; set; } // Constructor for the base class public MediaItem(string title, int publicationYear) { Title = title; PublicationYear = publicationYear; Console.WriteLine(\"MediaItem constructor called.\"); } // A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes public virtual void DisplayInfo() { Console.WriteLine($\"Title: {Title}\"); Console.WriteLine($\"Publication Year: {PublicationYear}\"); }I would need to have this open in OneNote so I can reference because my memory is so terrible. Is this a bad practice? Is this a normal problem? Obviously, I know it will get better with repetition, but it is very frustrating.",

With that, my friend and I would like to know how long it would possibly take to learn sql if we were to dedicate the next few weeks into it. We both set ourselves a deadline of exactly 2 weeks + 2 days (very ambitious I know; didn't really had a proper plan).We are also trying to do this to enhance our skills as aspiring programmers, and it would be great if you guys could provide any recommendations to sources where we could start learning off from.

To make a timeline of my experience, my learning journey truly started taking a coding class in school, learning basic python, html, and css. I then jumped from a lot of different coding camps until I decided on doing The Odin Project but I took a break from that too. So far I only know the basics of html, css, and javascript. Stuff like how to use and manipulate arrays and create basic websites. I also know the basics of python but starting and stopping has made me feel like I'm not making any real progress. I've been doing projects via The Odin Project and just finished the fundamentals course. I'm also on my schools robotics team and I'm dabbling in p5js for creative coding but I don't feel like I've learned as much as I should have since I've been programming since I was a freshman.Any advice would be appreciated, maybe I just don't have confidence?",

        "content": "I’m sharing this experience as context for the title.I've been learning Python fundamentals, and one of the topics I recently explored was working with dictionaries and lists. Yesterday, I started building a simple contact book that uses these structures. The idea was for the program to ask the user how many contacts they'd like to add, and then prompt for each contact’s name, phone number, and email. The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.I spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it. .update({x: {y: z}})Where x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.I felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.All of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up. Where do I draw the line?",

I see things for AI, full-stack development, a CS course, which might or might not have a quarter of things that I already know. I'm a little lost.

I don't like learning from YouTube videos unless I really have to. I prefer something as interactive and as structured as possible, like Codecademy or FreeCodeCamp.

My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one. Here's my current plan: 1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture. 2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). 3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects. 4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment. I'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources. ### My Questions:- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

I'm a very visual person and due to a series of conditions reading books is overwhelming for me, and I also know people with reading disabilities. I essentially want to make a program that can be inputed a large text file, hopefully a digital book, and then display it one line at a time. If I manage that much I'll think about other features. Since I mostly deal with C# I tried using winforms development with visual studio, but it seems it doesn't mix well with me, I keep ending up with the project seemilingy corrupted when I try to remove an added component, basically I don't like how it works. Is there a tool like Unity, with a visual editor I can organize the UI of the software and then add code to it that is for software? Using Unity seems overkill for this project and would make it heavier, etc.I would prefer this tool to use C# but similar languages or one that is less complex and easy to learn might work too.",

CS Program was C++ and it was the Assembly course that weeded me out back then. Did not touch coding during my other career.Went back to school 2 years ago for a couple of semesters before life got in the way again and I had to go get a real job again (working midnights unfortunately).I'm now slowly working my way through the C# course on Microsoft Learn / Free Code Camp on my nights off. I try to get at least a couple of modules done every night that I'm off. Currently using VS Code per course requirements.I know of VIM from back in school in the 1990s but never used it. I'm seeing remarks in various places that say VIM is typically used by Coding Freaks and command line Rangers.Is VIM a good IDE to help me learn and force me to be a better programmer?Thanks!Edit: when I said VIM, I meant VI and VIM",

I’m pretty sure I found the specific .pyc file that does what I’m looking for, but there are a lot of additional .pyc files in that directory that I’m struggling to understand the purpose of. The folder that contained the .pyc files and the .pyz directory looks like it mostly has initialization and compatibility code snippets, (the application references several .pyd and .dll files so I assume this is mostly related to compatibility between Python code and a windows executable file) but I’m not sure I understand why the meat and potatoes are all in a subfolder.",

Based on my performance so far, the senior team has decided to make me the frontend lead starting in July.I've been able to meet expectations and usually deliver on time. I can build UI components both in terms of functionality and appearance, but it often takes me a lot of time. As someone who aims to become a skilled developer, I find it frustrating to get stuck on things like debugging, CSS issues, and organizing my code better.I spend a lot of time trying to optimize and improve my code so it performs smoothly. Still, I often feel like I might be approaching frontend development the wrong way — especially when it comes to planning or structuring a page.If anyone can guide me on how to approach frontend development effectively — especially when working from a Figma design — or share helpful resources, I’d really appreciate it.",

I am a high school swimmer, and I have been heavily involved in running meets and repairing our timing system due to my schools limited funding. From this process I have noticed that the current \"industry standard\" meet management software leaves a bit to be desired and is exorbitantly expensive. I have always had an interest in computers and coding and I want to advance my skills. **End Vision** I have heard it is good to have a goal project as you learn. In the end (end likely means a matter of years as this is a side project/hobby), I would like to create something similar (an alternative to) *Hy-Tek Meet Manager For Swimming*. It does not have to be fully featured just to learn. This program runs on a database and tracks swimmers, events, and entries. It also has more advanced features including implementation with timing consoles and the sort, but I am currently not concerned with this. **My Question**What might be some coding languages/applications I would want to learn to approach a program like this? I am assuming I would need some form of database back end with a gui on the front. Where should I start? I would prefer not to take true college classes or anything like that. I know there are bootcamps, but Id much prefer to do something at my own pace as this is a side hobby. Any information is greatly appreciated!",

It's not normal and I think it is breaking our industry.I was talking to a family member who was a developer in in 90s, and he said any time he needed a job he would apply to 5 roles and get at least one job offer. Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. Even in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.I feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. For those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.But every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

If you’re a computer science grad, is there a country where your skills actually pay off? And most importantly… Should we stay and “fight”, or pack our laptops and move?",

There isnt much growth anymore but I make 170k. Should I go to the next job that is offering 200k. A con of the new job is that even though the work is interesting it seems I would have to put alot more hours and have to re-create relationships\".It shows how for alot of people, they never make enough money. Im victim of this too. I just think that at a certain point deciding between 170k or 200k isn't much diffnerent. I dont think that 30k is going to change your life by that much. It's nice to have that extra money but why risk possibly hvaing terrible work life balance, leaving a job that you have known for years and values you to a job that you may need to spend years re-building that trust. To each their own but I see these post where the only pro is they get paid more, and all the cons are work life balance may take a hit. I dont know everybody's life so im making some assumptions here.",

In the first recruiter call, they asked for my salary expectations. I asked for their range, as an example here, let’s say they said $150K–$180K. I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.I am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.Next day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.Edit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work. They will come back and say can’t do 150 but can do 140. But I guess not.",

The few I know personally were extremely talented folks.

        "author": "cscqthrowaway16661",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was hired at this company a few months ago, it's a larger startup with a few hundred employees, and I got in via the referral of a friend who works there, although he's in a different department. I was hired as a senior SWE but the impression I'm getting is that they basically wanted me to be a lead SWE instead. We have a principal on our team as well as a few juniors and midlevel, and essentially, they hired me not as an IC but I guess more of a manager of the juniors? The principal is too busy on multiple other teams and projects to really participate in our team, although he does sometimes.This all came to a head when a few weeks ago on the 1:1 the manager said I wasn't acting like I was the second in command so to speak, but I told them I felt hired as more of an IC and for the past few months before that, no one had communicated anything regarding managerial type work at all. Nevertheless, we agreed on some action items like me being more present in the Slack, doing more code reviews, mentoring the juniors (all of which I was doing already but I just started documenting them in a work log then), as well as creating tickets and assigning and delegating work, even if that means I do less overall IC work myself (but, isn't that what the managers and scrum masters are supposed to do? Why am I responsible for that part?). The 1:1 the week after that, they presented a PIP. The PIP itself is quite vague, it wants me to take more \"ownership\" and \"leadership\" of the project as I'm the only one on the team who can since the principal is so busy, part of which is talking more in meetings apparently. When I presented the action items I was already doing, they said it was a good start but I needed to do more, but they were very vague on what that actually meant, they couldn't really define it at all since it had nothing to do with concrete performance metrics like \"finished or didn't finish X tickets per sprint.\"It said PIP on the document but I didn't sign anything and they didn't ask me to, they didn't even CC HR like a traditional PIP would be. It's a 30 day one so I have to improve in the next 4 weeks apparently but I honestly don't get what they even want from me and every time I ask, they can't tell me anything more concrete. Essentially I think they hired me as a senior SWE when they really wanted to hire a lead (or even an engineering manager), and now they're trying to make me do lead/principal level work for senior pay (I'd need probably another 50k for that to happen). It all seems so sudden, like only a couple weeks ago they tell me about these sudden new \"performance\" problems when the several months before since I joined, there had been no complaints in the 1:1s.So now I'm just injecting myself in the meetings and asking questions no matter how dumb they sound, and it seems like the manager is pleased but it's all just so dumb, they literally said that they don't know if I understand things when I'm not talking in the meetings; I'm not talking so I can listen to what the more experienced team members are saying (we have some outside contractors and the full time devs were hired to eventually replace them, but in domain knowledge, the contractors know more than we do, so I also think the manager is comparing us to them too).Edit: I think people here are assuming I'm not doing senior level ticket cutting and talking often to the principal on architecture and code choices, etc, I am, it's that they seem to want even more people management type work in that they want me to essentially manage the work of the juniors and check in with them every couple days which is fine and which is something I've been doing but somehow they want even more management out of me.",

Then he asked - When can you join - I told him, give me 2 weeks to think about it, the CEO said No, give me an early response. Then the CTO told him to atleast tell me about the company. Then he talked about the company. After it, I was desperate so I joined it.First day - They didn't even gave me any offer letter, just onboarded me on their payroll system, they didn't even gave me company laptops. So I started the day at 10 am, get every system access(github, backend) access around 11am-12 pm, they have already assigned me a ticket. Around 3 pm, the CTO asked me whether I am done, which I said No because they have hired me as an AI engineer position and their work/tickets assigned were for backend development. Then CEO came around 5 pm, started asking me whether I am done, then he further asked me around 7 pm- How much percentage I am done of the first ticket. I was really exhausted after 7:30 pm so I left, the ticket was still assigned. Also, second ticket was also assigned around nighttime to me.Meanwhile, at the same night, he called the other developer and asked him- How was my performance on the first day.I thought a bit at the same night, and then I told them I can't work there. All of my friends are saying that I should have stayed there, and I am behaving like an entitled Gen-Z and startups are run like this only and I should have collected atleast few paychecks. According to me, working there would have impacted my psyche negatively, and wasted my time which I could have utilised applying elsewhere.But am I over-reacting, am I a weak-willed person or was I correct in judging it.p.s - Office was in open areas of WeWork.",

I am the best at building front ends, but apparently I'm not the best at figuring out wordle edge cases while people with half my experience stare me.If you are in college for CS, I cannot tell you strongly enough to change your major to business. You're going to put in thousands of applications even when you have a decade of experience and you will have to go through endless interview rounds. Even when you are in demand, you will still need to jump through these endless hoops where people ask you completely useless facts and then smirk at you when you don't figure out the specific edge cases in the worldle app the made you code.Please do not respond to this by saying \"well that's just because it takes 5 interviews to tell whose a good software engineer.\" It doesn't. Software engineering is like any other profession, we do not need these endless tests.I feel like I am going crazy and seriously thinking about leaving the industry for one with an actual sane interview process.

I'm exhausted because unlike in the first seven years of my career, people have started to have 5 interviews on average, *including* coding tests. If everybody had reasonable hiring processes *like they used to* I would not be as angry even if I were failing them, because at least then I could move on quickly.Edit 2: I am not asking to do away with coding interviews. I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses. Every single of one of those failing businesses had elaborate hiring processes. Startup failure rates are blazingly high, 30 percent higher than other small businesses, because they do things like these stupid elaborate hiring processes.",

I sincerely believe the economic uncertainty is the one to cause these situations since tech is very high off the luxury ladder. Like you will always need somebody to build a house but if you are in warfare AI assisted vscode forks can wait, and this might put some stress on the companies. And again, because if they will state this their stock prices will be nuked, they are just saying that \"AI\" is the cause, that they are doing automation so good they don't need workers!..While the reason is simply we might not be in a really good time for a thing like consumer tech to shine and see a bright future ahead of it.",

        "author": "Candid-Progress-1184",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "When writing your resume and negotiating pay, be mindful that Equifax operates a database called The Work Number that contains info on past employers, titles, pay, etc for a huge number of employees in the US. I recently discovered my report was wrong: it claimed I was a 'payroll specialist' rather than a 'computer systems engineer' at a previous employer because the person filling out the form put their own title instead of mine... About half my previous employers have entered data into it, and I have a feeling it might be integrated into modern HR tooling and ERP systems.Definitely check your report and make sure no one jacked up your previous title, pay, etc. Receiving a copy of any consumer credit report, including these ones, is free. My current employer tells them about every single one of my paychecks, so keep in mind future employers might literally be able to see when you got your raises too. If you're as cautious as I am, you probably want to make sure the titles listed on your resume at least bear a passing resemblance to the ones in the report so it doesn't set off alarm bells for HR folks who don't understand tech title equivalence. If you're considering overemployment, note that both roles could show up on the report.There are many other organizations that claim to provide info like this: I contacted the top 100 and no one else had any data on me, so I think The Work Number is far and away the most popular.It's possible to freeze your report just like any other credit report, but keep in mind this might look suspicious.Anyway, just be mindful that this stuff is out there and people have easy access to it. I think employers are technically supposed to tell you when the contents of a credit report are used against you, but it's impossible to enforce since they can just say nothing. You can get bad data removed for free as long as the employer either agrees it was wrong or just doesn't respond when Equifax contacts them.Stay safe and aware out there, folks.EDIT: Turns out they still have to get your consent before pulling this info, which occurs as part of the background check phase. Thanks to u/mediocreDev313 for the clarification!EDIT2: I just pulled up my report to double-check what all is on it. The report can include:Union affiliation, worker's comp award dates, reason for termination, base pay, overtime, commission, bonuses, holiday pay, pension income, severance, vested stock, stick and vacation pay, tips, hours worked for each individual pay period, garnishments, cafeteria plan fees, next projected date and amount of pay increase, last date and amount of pay increase, payroll deduction for insurance coverage, reasons for insurance ineligibility, insurance coverage level, number of covered dependents on insurance, and COBRA participation.EDIT3: Here's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's list of consumer reporting agencies, contact details, and links to freeze your various reports: [files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb\\_consumer-reporting-companies-list\\_2023.pdf](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-reporting-companies-list_2023.pdf)",

Over the summer my team hired some interns and this one annoyed me to no end. Every word that came out of his mouth was filtered through a layer of buzzwords and asskissing to the point i had to mute my audio while he's talking. I counted down the day before he left and thought that was the end of it. The first workday of the new year is when our boss announced that this intern would be returning fulltime. My first issue with him was when i refactored a file in our codebase that he was also working on. He released a PR that undid everything i fixed in my refactor, but i was patient and told him when there are merge conflicts it's expected to meet with the other author to resolve it together. This happened just before i took a week of PTO and where i returned to find he blindly pushed his PR overwritting all my changes. My refactor got deprioritized for a couple weeks, but i finally got to remaking my changes only for him to try and do the same thing before being caught by another developer. At first all my complaints about him were about his personality, but after seeing more of his pull requests its become obvious he doesn't know how to code and is just copy/pasting AI responses without any thought as long as they accomplish the job. Our job gave every developer a Microsoft CoPilot license, which i also use to help get out of roadblocks, but reviewing his PRs is basically just rewritting AI slop.",

I'm EU based, all the positions are EU/UK based. I would love to move to US eventually, hence why I'm not too keen in joining Huawei. I definitely enjoyed meeting the AWS team, as it's very much related to my research topic.Would it look bad career-wise if I accept the SDE1 position at AWS, since I have a PhD?EDIT:Some clarifications. The research scientist role at Meta would be a \"glorified\" software engineering position. I do non-AI distributed system research, and I found basically no research-heavy opportunities for such a topic in EU, except for Huawei. On the other hand, a software engineering job in a company such as AWS or Meta would help me gain practical experience nonetheless",

However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.As a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.Was wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this? Any advice? Would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

The thing is I feel like I’m cheating, because I find a lot of thing pointless to learn when I have full solution from AI in a few seconds. Things that would require me some time to understand, are at my fingertips. I can make a whole project required by my teacher and make it even better than is required, but with AI. Without it I’d have to spend like 4x time to learn things first, but when AI responds with ready code, I understand it, but it would take a lot of time for me to code it ‘that’ way.I enjoy it anyway and spend dozens of hours on projects with AI. I can do a lot with it while understanding the code but not that much without it.What is world’s take on this? How it looks like in corporations? Do they still require us to code something at interviews? Will this make me a bad coder?",

They went from the entire world showering them with money and praise to investors getting on their asses and making them actually focus on the fundamentals of their business. 9 out of 10 startups fail, and never has that been more evident than 2025.So 95 percent of their lives are just taking shit and eating it, from investors, from customers, from the overall sentiment of the country about tech. And yet in this very specific area, they are kings that get to make people arbitrarily jump through hoops on command and hear how great they are. I don't believe that the startup founders themselves think this is why they're doing it, but I bet this is why they're all convincing themselves that, as owners of unprofitable small businesses, that they absolutely need that fourth and fifth interview.",

Thus, my employment would last around 6 to 8 months, depending on when I start. My question is whether I should mention this quit date during the application process or whether it's best to ommit it as it will hurt my chances of getting a job? Are companies typically open to agreeing to \"pause\" my contract for the duration of the exchange semester? I kind of feel bad if I don't mention it but perhaps it's the most strategic thing to do.Any advice or personal opinions would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm used to living very frugally and have enough savings, and not many medical bills, so would it be crazy to quit my job to better spend my time gaining skills I actually want to use in my career? I would probably get a part-time job in the meantime to help myself but not take so much of my time. Thinking about this since I don't want to get stuck deeper into a career that I loathe - I am quite miserable albeit financially secure, and leveling up in an area of my interest is more important to me than money beyond basic survival.

It's been tough even getting interviews but I've had 4 so far and advanced to the final round of one of them, but unfortunately didn't get it. Last week on Monday for some reason I had 4 recruiters reach out to me for a HR Interview/ call. They were all rlly cool/big companies so I got my hopes up. Each Recruiter on the call told me they would like to schedule a technical round with me for the next week and that I would soon be getting an email to schedule that technical interview. All of them told me I'd get the email for further steps in 1-2 days after the call, but after waiting an extra day for each I respectfully followed up with the recruiters and got no response from all 3. I have one more interview coming up from the last recruiter, but idk how this one's gonna go cuz my resume is the most different from this job so im just studying up as much as i can. This was super dissapointing cuz I've been studying a lot so I just wanted to vent. Is this a common practice for New Grad recruiters to ghost the ppl they interview after telling them they advanced?",

        "content": "So here’s a bit of context. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Civil Engineering. A couple years later I decided to switch careers, so I went back to school to study Computer Science. A bunch of my credits were transferred, so I finished the CS degree in 3 semesters with a 4.0 GPA and graduated in 2020. Since then… nothing. I’ve been applying for dev jobs ever since but haven’t been able to land a single proper interview. I didn’t do any internships because I didn’t know the job market would be this bad which I regret right now. I couldn’t afford to sit around waiting, so I’ve been working full-time in sales to pay the bills which makes it a bit harder for me since I don’t have a lot of free time to focus on job hunting and building projects.That said, I didn’t give up on tech. I’ve been learning on my own, building personal projects whenever I have a bit of free time, and I’ve also worked with a small agency on a project basis (not full-time) since late 2023.At this point I’m honestly burnt out and confused. Is it my resume? My background? Is the market just that bad? I’d really appreciate any advice or feedback, especially from anyone who broke in after a similar detour.",

With benefits and bonus I'm just over 200k but I see all my peers at FAANG with the same YOE getting TC around 300k+. I've chalked up this difference to the stock options I receive being illiquid but even if we hit our goal IPO valuation (likely as we have a billionaire angel investor but it may take years) I'd be barely ahead of them in terms of total pay over the 5+ years of our overall career, while also having taken on far more risk. I'm considering attempting to make the jump into a bigger company to get some more upward growth options. The problem is that I hear the market is super competitive now so I'm not sure if its worth investing the time into getting back into interview shape. I'm also worried about burnout, since I am fully remote here and usually only go in-office twice a week for food. Big companies seem to be hard pushing RTO and I would miss being able to take work-cations around the world.With all that being said, do you guys think its the right career move to make the jump? I've been here since graduating almost 5 years ago and am starting to feel a bit stagnant. It's like golden handcuffs except instead of good TC the carrot is just a relaxed schedule and remote option which seems to be dwindling. Those of you who have made the transition from startups to big tech, was it difficult to get interviews and offers? Did you think it was the right move career-wise?",

        "content": "I'm a new grad trying to enter the industry (SWE), and I’ve had some experience with both startups and larger companies. I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.In particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.I get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.So how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company? And how many should be treated as signs to walk away?Would really appreciate any thoughts, heuristics, or personal experience. I’m trying to understand how to tell the difference between healthy chaos and exploitation / red flags to walk away from.",

To keep things short without getting into details, they want me to do the job of 4 people for $60k pay and it's super stressful and I have to teach myself everything while dealing with large problems. I'm the only developer in the startup. And management isn't happy with my performance. I do think I'm burning out. They've told me I have 2 weeks to get my stuff together. They didn't explicitly use the word \"fire\" but I think we all know what they were hinting at.Now I'm really stressed. There's an 80% chance I'm fired in 2 weeks. Who gets fired from their first job?I'm not sure what to do. Obviously I should start searching for jobs asap but in 2025, what are the chances I can land something so quick? It took me 8 months to find this. I also don't know if I should keep this on my reume. It's 4 months and empoyers might ask why I'm no longer there. What do I even tell them? Everything feels like it's falling apart. I don't even think 75% of what I do here has helped me become a better developer.",

        "author": "Accipitrim",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.**((This part is just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \\~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't \"crazy\" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave, but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.All of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \\~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.I still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\\-----------------------------------------------------I know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",

I maintain middleware backend web services for my large finance company's mobile apps (mobile BFF architecture) in TypeScript. I've gotten good at TS, can implement whatever's given to me, the job's stable and secure. I'm fortunate in many ways.The problem is... the architecture means I've got no experience with DBs. Not even ORMs. We don't really roll our own infra, rarely we'll change an IAC config file somewhere. No gRPC. No real system design skills to speak of. Node+TS on the backend is also a weird place to be in this market where companies want you to fit to a T, it's in the intersection of front and backend.We basically get together, talk about the future states of some parts of the mobile app, get the data from downstream services and just add business logic so that our REST endpoints have XYZ fields. It's gotten too easy, I don't feel like I'm growing and I'm worried about the skills I have vs those I *should* have on paper. The current market is also making it hard to switch jobs to get more breadth/depth. I've been trying to upskill on the side by learning Spring & iOS but ofc real-life production issues are very different from projects.Honestly I feel like a fraud whenever I hear staff SWEs speak about architecture, system design, and tech challenges they face.

Or you will see in work places arbitrary deadlines set by management and no real flexibility around these deadlines nor any data backing up how they came to the conclusion how that deadline was reached.First, I think developers need to stop making up for managements lack of skill. Make them either descope work, extend deadlines, or hire more people if they have unrealistic deadlines. Do not work overtime for a company that is not going to pay you extra to do so and will lay you off even if you work extra time for them.Second, I think most companies would be better off if they automated away most of these positions. I think it would lead to more realistic deadlines, less unreasonable requests to developers, less missed deadlines or poor coding practices because realistic deadlines would be in place, and an all around better experience for everyone including investors.I think this should be the new movement. To automate most management positions out of existence.What do others think?",

Instead of joining the formal workforce, I've spent the last 20 years being an unpaid family caregiver for sick relatives. I literally haven't written a single line of code since graduation, and the only programming languages I've used were BASIC as a kid, Perl during an internship between high school and college, and C and C++ during school - and C++ was only taught as \"C with classes\" with no mention of the Standard Template Library or any other library besides \"iostream.h\", so if I wanted to try to get a job in tech, I'd need to learn something people actually use today, such as Python, Java, or perhaps even R for data science and statistics. (I'm within commuting distance of NYC and the finance industry hires a lot of computer people.) I've also used SQL but forgotten almost all of it.Anyway, all the sick relatives I'd been taking care of died last year (including my wife :sad_but_relieved_face:), so I need to find something else to do with my life. I have enough financial leeway that I won't actually need to work for quite a while, and I thought that if I wanted to pursue programming as a career, a (hopefully reputable) bootcamp might be a good option, because it would help me get up to speed on modern development and create a portfolio to show to potential employers. I'm also not particularly self-motivated or disciplined, so trying to learn on my own, without a structured program that has deadlines, wouldn't be my first choice of approach; if going to a physical classroom is an option, I would really prefer it over an online-only program because I'd be less likely to flake. Would the combination of my degree and having completed a bootcamp give me a reasonable chance of getting an entry level job *somewhere* in spite of my age and resume gap, or is the job market for programmers without work experience just that bad right now?",

Therefore a PhD may be neccesary. While i do enjoy NLP, it isnt my dream speciality, but it is adjacent to what i want to do.With the current job market being trash, i also realize how hard it is to get a job within a company, and am afraid that taking a PhD might just worsen my position in 3 years when im done as opposed to gaining experience. I applied to around 400 companies in 2025, and only got 4 interviews (also had 5 people reach out to me and thats where i got these 2 job opportunities).To summarize longterm goal in order: Job security, research role, salarySeeking any advice / perspectives.",

How can I say no to this without raising red flags or burning bridges.Is there a chance to prove myself and get better oportunidades internally?Would it be better to just accept it temporarily while I job hunt, or is there a way to professionally decline without torpedoing my standing?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm 52, not from a STEM background and only graduated in CS at age 49 (full backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11g5wjf/graduated_in_cs_at_age_49_but_ive_ended_up_doing/)). After circa 800 applications and about a dozen interviews I finally got a role with the UK Civil Service for nearly 2 years, initially as a Trainee Software Engineer on a fixed-term contract at £22K, but managed to get a slight promotion into another fixed-term contract as Junior Software Engineer and was on £27K by the time my contract was due to expire. (There was no chance of renewal as it was maternity cover). I made over 100 applications but only had one offer, this time as Software Engineer for a small firm in the renewable energy installation sector. The range was stated to be £35K - £50K; they only offered £36K but with no other offers and only 1 week left of my contract I thought I had better take what I could get. (Worth bearing in mind that AFAIK Scotland and the North doesn't tend to offer anything like the salaries one tends to get in London anyway though).On my very first day they made 5 people redundant but I was told not to worry as my salary was paid for out of grant money. Obviously that raises the question what's going to happen when the grant money runs out. I should say I am the only SWE and there are no IT staff at all, just installers, operations, and sales people basically. My supervisor and myself didn't hit it off very well and things were a bit tense trying to work out exactly what they wanted me to do. It was all quite nebulous and completely different from the Civil Service as you might expect. No tickets, no version control in place, basically just 'here's your laptop and this is what we want'. They want me to build an API aggregator that brings together API services from a number of different renewable energy manufacturers (that's what the grant money is for). I was sharing an office with an 'actual' engineer (i.e. an electrical engineer), but he left for another firm that was going to give him better training / certs. Seemingly they wouldn't give him a £3K raise and amazingly it turned out he was on even less than me, even though he had far more responsibility and went out on jobs and all sorts.I have built this whole web application for them in TS/JS/Node/React/Express. I have used a certain amount of AI (mainly Claude, also Perplexity) to help me along, but in fairness I now have no senior dev to turn to for advice. I have actually found it helps my learning quite a bit and I ask it tons of learning questions instead of just blindly copy-pasting. In fact I sometimes tell it *not* to give me any code, but just advice/guidance. I have pushed it all to a GitHub repo but so far it has not been deployed. It is about 100 or so files, thousands of lines of code, takes in 3 different APIs, does both local and browser DB stuff, and has a lot of unit tests written in Jest. If I say so myself it is pretty neat and everyone who has seen it has been impressed. It is dead fast and has a lot of error handling. The UI is only so-so as that's not really my forte, but I've seen worse.The problems are many though. The low salary, almost total lack of job security, no bank holidays (WTF?), and now my supervisor has really started to become quite unpleasant. Yesterday he totally bit my head off because I had the temerity to ask if I had now got through my probation OK, since that was due to finish on the 10th. He accused me of being 'irritable', said I must have been 'dwelling on it', and that apparently I should have been 'proactive' and mentioned it earlier. The last I think is total nonsense as I was patiently waiting for him to tell me the probation was done. To my mind it could have come across as quite premature to bring it up prior to the date. When I showed him some code I had written he said 'there must be an easier way of doing it than that', which I thought was tantamount to saying I had gone about it the long way. OFC he never stated what the easier way might be. Seemingly he did some MATLAB back in the day but doesn't like other languages because they use 0-indexing for arrays (SMH). Yesterday he came in, I asked him how he was, but he didn't reciprocate and said nothing at all to me for 3-4 hours, literally not a word. It was only when I asked him about the probation he then kicked off.The owner (who sits in the office next to mine) is fine and I get along with him no problem. The other office staff are OK but I feel totally out of it as they are focussed on sales and installations, and I just have almost no sense of being part of a team like I at least somewhat had in CS. There I had so little to do, I felt like a substitute sat on the bench on the sidelines, but at least I was around other devs who were mainly very supportive in my 'learning journey'. Being an older entrant into the IT sector (I couldn't even afford a PC until I got a hand-me-down in my late 20s) is not always easy, as you might imagine.So WTH am I gonna do? Try to brush up [my CV](https://i.imgur.com/JzEFPuP.png) and just start applying, I guess? Trying to move on after 3 months seems like a big ask. There are only limited opportunities in southern Scotland and fully remote, and I am not at all willing to sell my home (again), especially after only 7 months here. I use all [these sites](https://i.imgur.com/g8ggTlb.png) and find LinkedIn never even gets me so much as an interview. I have previously sent a lot of CVs to recruiters and built up a quite big list of their contacts. I have nearly 250 connections on LinkedIn with a lot of recruiters and devs. Having made nearly 1000 applications in the last 2.5 years I know what to do but the 3 months is a big problem, right?!?TIA for any (constructive) advice.Edit to add: one thing that did occur to me is maybe I should lean into the situation and ask for more money. But perhaps that could backfire?",
